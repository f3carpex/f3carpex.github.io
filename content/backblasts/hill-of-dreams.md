Thank you for the opportunity to lead. The hill Esau suicide ladder envoked more running than anticipated. I am sure Franklin hates me.......even more than before. The group was very encouraging to each other. Nature Boy was conserving energy for the last few Ras-lin practices of the year. Moped informed me he was a junior at Cary High School when I started coaching there.....10 years ago. Feeling old now, thanks Moped.
