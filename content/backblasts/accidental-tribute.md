When planning this workout I thought about picking a theme or even sky writing but nothing came to me. So I picked a route and some exercises and went with it.

Jog to the front of the school and completing a figure 8 with the loops.

Warm Up - SSH, Good Mornings, Merkins, and Plank Jacks.

Thang 1 - Partner up for laps around the figure 8 route. Alternating 8 burpees, 8 partner merkins when you see your partner. Meet your partner 4 times for about 2 laps.

Thang 2 - Run to the traffic circle for Partner 1 lunging while Partner 2 does a lap. Repeat 4 times

Thang 3 - Run back to the field behind the school. Partner 1 Balls to the all, Partner 2 Runs across the field and does 5 Tuck Jumps. 4 Times.

20 - Splits squats at the shelter to give our arms a break.

Thang 4 - Jacobs Ladder in the parking lot because the field was wet. Hand release merkins up to 20 by 2. This was hard!

Mary - Set of 100s in honor of Squatter. These are hard to count!

COT - 8 GT and 6 Ruckers Rolling Stone

As Largemouth pointed out, the accidental tribute is to my 4th kid Maggie as we did 4 thangs, 4 sets, and for the 4 wheels of the stroller or the push Ducky our route made (see below). Thanks for letting me lead and I appreciate the accountability and friendship F3 brings.
