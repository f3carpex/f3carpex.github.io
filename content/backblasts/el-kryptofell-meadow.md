Sometimes it's just important to get a BB together to celebrate the fact that the most miles and greatest elevation covered at ANY AO on Monday, the First Day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand and twenty one was at Winterfell.

Thirteen studs crushed >3,5 miles and >250 ft of gain.

They are all recruit-ready for BRR 2021.

Enjoyed it fellas. Not much talking up that little incline this morning.

COT:

13 studs

Announcements: If you are not going to the Duck Donuts Dash then suggest attending Suck Up's Q at Green Mile.

Prayers: sometimes it's good to not have to ask for anything. We said thanks instead.
