## Bridge and Rock Work

 

As I was sitting in my warm truck having some quite time Callahan came along waving me to get out. We all starting stretching and catching up. I soon realized that Shut-In needs to add to his list (Why I started b/c it's free and outdoors list) "Does Callahan need a hug" Apparently Callahan thought I was sick and didn't want me close to him, I clarified I was fine and gave him a big hug.

Joe Smith did an excellent job giving the F3 disclaimer to 2 FNG's.

Time to roll out, short jog and we did 23 Merkins, 9 Imperial Walkers and 15 Plank Jacks. Time for some Bridge work, partnered up and did Carolina Dry Docks while partner sprinted across and back over the bridge, next was Wide Grip Merkins, and LBC's. We then did a group lunge walk to the center and enjoyed some balls to the wall. We then lunged walked to the end. Bear Crawl was next back to center followed by more Balls to the Wall. Slow jog back to the rock pile. Got a partner rock and started with Curls while other partner ran in-between the cement balls and the parking lot, next was rows, triceps extension, LBC's and we ended on one more set of Curls. Time to head back to the flag, apparently the young guns decided that a Billy runs was going down so off they went. We circled up and did some LBC's and Low Slow Flutters.

It great to see some gun guys out and I asked them to keep and eye out for their buddies. People can get down and we need to be able to help them and lift them up.

Happy 19th Wedding Anniversary Saban.

 

I took us out and asked God for the encouragement to reach out and help others, let us be strong disciples and be good influences on the people around us.

I'm so thankful for all you men who have shown me amazing support and love this past 18 months. F3 is such a huge part of my life and I'll never be able to thank you guys enough.
