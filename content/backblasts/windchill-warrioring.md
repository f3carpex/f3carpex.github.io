Advice about being out in the cold from the Boy Scouts:  
layer up.

Advice about being out in the cold from "To Build a Fire":  
keep moving (and learn to build a fire)

Advice about being out in the cold from Costco:  
Little Hotties are $30 for a box of 40.

Advice about being out in the cold from my wife last night:  
"You're an idiot"

The PAX at A-Team this morning I think agreed with all of the above.

### Warm-up

- Avoid the ice on the mosey into the park
- SSH x20, GM x10, Squats x10, Skater Slides x10, something else x something

### Thang:

Find a partner - **speed** matters. Partner 1 runs the pickle at the top of the hill while Partner 2 jogs down the hill, 5 burpees and backup. Timing was immaculate. 5 partner merkins at the top and flip flop. Repeato x3

Indian Run to the lollipop. Squat pulses until the 6 is in.

Mosey to the big shelter. LRSU x15, derkins x15, dips IC x15, irkins x15.

Celebration merkins in groups of 5. 10 merkins each, on your down.

LRSU x10, derkins x10, dips IC x10, irkins x10. 
  
LRSU x5, derkins x5, dips IC x5, irkins x5.

PAX getting nervous about QSource. 3 lines on the bruisers, Bartman and Hanson. Psyche! Turnaround... take the longer way 'round.

### Mary:

Keep the PAX off the ground so keep it simple with Peter Parkers, Shakiras Left, Chillcut Count-a-rama, Shakiras Right, Chillcut Count-a-rama, Plank Jacks.

COT

- 20 PAX, including one Hate and a whole mess of wise Respects
- Announcements:
    - The Trudge anni is next week. Site Q handover planned
    - Tortoises anni is coming up as well. #2ndF in the church immediately following
    - Yogi is planning the Sooooouuuuuuul Train for the end of March. Date is set, plans are TBD
- Prayers:
    - Coxswain's 10.5 year old dog
    - Officer Ainsworth, his family and his Troop

### NMS

- The PAX in CARPEx fall into two camps: those who know what little hotties are and those who don't. When YHC dropped about a dozen of these convenience packs on the ground, a few smart men immediately grabbed one and were comfortable the rest of the morning. The snickering few who didn't ... well, Jack London would have written about them too.
- It wasn't nearly as cold as my brain thought it would be when the alarm went off.
- Disco is a solid, and nervous, site-Q. Man made sure I was going to be there!
- Unlike the bagel place DTC, La Farm will still let you in to buy some bread even though they don't technically open for another 15 minutes. HIMs.
