It was a lovely yet chilly morning in the gloomiest of Monday Morning AO's in Carpex. With it being the first full week of recommended (and in many cases mandated) social distancing, along with it being the morning after the Off-The-Books Tobacco Road Marathon, I was expecting low numbers. We had a grand total of 4 PAX. I was glad that those who came came and also glad that those who felt like they should stay away stayed away.

**Warm-up**  
After we proclaimed our allegiance to these United States of America, we ran around the park track.  
We then squared up in the basket ball court for:  
Good Mornings x7  
SSH x20 (due to the numbers, the entire workout was changed in my head during SSH)  
Imperial Walkers x15  
Sir Fazzio Arm Circles fwd x10 bwd x10  
Overhead Clap x10  
Seal Clap x10  
Michael Phelps x10  
Calf Stretch

**Thing 1**  
Lap around the park track.  
4 stations at the playground:  
Person 1 - Burpees x15  
Person 2 - Mountain Climbers (until Person 1 is finished)  
Person 3 - Pull-ups (until Person 1 is finished)  
Person 4 - Merkins (until Person 1 is finished)  
Rotate Stations until each person has done each station.
