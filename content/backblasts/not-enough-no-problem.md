Filling in for the legendary @www is no easy task. Prepped the workout and all plans are in place. Until Texas Ranger posts on slack “might not be enough cinders”. When I showed up on site and ran quickly to see the cinder count, I thought I should be good with about 10 or so Pax standing around and roughly 9 min to “go time”. But... cars continued to roll in and by the time we began it was 19 solid HIMs waiting for some fun. The key to a good Q is the ability to make adjustments and make them quickly. With only 9 cinders and a few hand held blocks, I think we made the most of it :). But you will have to ask those who were there.

Warm-up **Included some Good mornings and on my way to several other planned warm-ups when Thunderstruck began playing after Texas Ranger asked for music. Well,,, if you are filling in for @www ya gotta run with Thunderstuck burpees so... We finished the warm-up with a few other shoulder movements and some squat holds.**

THANG 1

After grabbing the coupons and partnering up we did 5 rounds of the following: Partner 1 rand down and did 10 pull-ups while partner 2 lunged with the coupon. The PAX just kept getting quieter as we proceeded. This was a great leg and upper body beat down. Enjoy walking up stairs today fellas, I know I’m sore.

THANG 2

Onto the top of the hill with coupon in hand for some 7s on the nasty hill down to the speed bump. Overhead extensions at the top, burpees at the bottom. I meant to call Merkins there, but burpees came out. Oh well.

MARY

Ive

Just enough time for MARY as I’ve heard we are not doing enough of lately. 50 LBC’s and 30 Homer to Marge just about did it

ANNOUNCEMENTS: Green Mile this Saturday. July 4th Convergence and the new Thursday AO was announced. Look for it’s own post this evening

PRAYERS for all the PAX who are injured and Leprechaun’s driving test :) and DP Q on Friday.
