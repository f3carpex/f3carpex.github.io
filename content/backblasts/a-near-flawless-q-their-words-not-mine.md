Break up into two groups for a little Indian Run; Catch Me If You Can; Group Exercise Combo. The entire group performs an exercise together, EXCEPT, the HIM at the back of the line. He performs his own exercise. When the group is finished, they take off. HIM needs to catch up and take the lead spot. The group then performs the exercise together while the new HIM at the end of the line does his. Repeat.

Prayers for Denali's wife to get over her cold and help this poor man take care of his family before it becomes too much for him to handle on his own.
