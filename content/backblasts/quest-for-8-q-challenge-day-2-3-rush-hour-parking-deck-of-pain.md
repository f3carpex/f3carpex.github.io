Doubling down in the Quest for 8 Q challenge. I wanted to continue the challenge and ensure the PAX got their moneys worth. I decided on the Dez of Pain and no better place to do it than in the parking deck.

I'm always glad to see the HIMs out there who want to continue the work on making their body strong. I want to give a shout out to Reentry because he is keeping up with me. If you did not know, Reentry is an HONOR (double respect: 60+) and just flat out killing it.

As the bell tolls, we start this extravaganza. F-ministravia (Core Values, Credo, Mission) and we Pledge our Allegiance to Old Glory. Off we go on a mosey to the parking lot. I directed the running PAX to take the front entrance tot he parking deck and meet Reentry and I at the first level.

Circle up for warm-up: GM (control freak style), plank into runner's stretch right leg and back to plank for some CFMs mixed in. Runner's stretch left leg and back to plank for some Eskimo merkins mixed in. Recover. Sir Fazios forward and reverse.

Gather around for the thang. I pull out two decks of pain ... one for the bottom of the parking deck incline and the second one for the top of the parking deck incline. YHC/QIC calls out the workout:

Thang:

Diamond: diamond merkins

Clubs: flutter kicks

Hearts: air presses

Spades: Jump squats

Favorite suit of the day was diamonds. I did not know that Diamonds are not just a woman's best friend. It can also be a man's favorite ... diamond merkins that is.

We did enough travels up and down the incline that we hit 2 miles. Not bad for distance.

Mosey back to the flag to close out the festivities with a round of PAX favorite Mary 10 reps.

COR: 8

NOR: Honor (1), Respect (2), mehs (5)

Annoucements: Oakwood 24, food drive

NMS: Tclaps to Reentry for #3 following along with me.

Prayers for the Brothers who are working through some injuries.

Double deck of pain cards makes it for an interesting beatdown
