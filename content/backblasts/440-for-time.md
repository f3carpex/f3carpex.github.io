6 PAX gathered at the Big Top on perhaps the least gloomy morning of 2019 so far, 3 of them within a minute of go-time. Goose arrived 5 minutes early expecting the usual punctual PAX for some pre-workout fellowship...he was disappointed. He was also hoping to sweat, I hope he wasn't doubly disappointed. I get excited planning Qs, especially when they seem particularly novel, challenging, or CSAUP-y. Today qualifies.

**Beaker's Beginnings (The Warm-up)**

Mosey around the middle school building, stopping at corners for: 20x SSH, 10x Windmills, 10x cotton-pickers, 10x good mornings, and 10x merkins. It was an extra-long distance warm-up to make up for what I had planned next.

**Beaker's Beatdown (The Thang)**

As we assembled on the finest track in NW Cary (on a Thursday morning), I let the PAX know we would be performing a timed 440 today. Meaning, we would try to complete one lap around the track (400 meters) by doing 10x Burpee Broad-Jumps, followed by 10x merkins, 10x squats, 10x WWIIs, and 10s plank-hold (40 reps). Repeato, Repeato all the way around the track. The plank-hold was audibled to a 6" leg-hold after two rounds.

Goose sweated and we made it about 300 yards before time was up...maybe I will skip warm-up next time.
