### Warm Up

Do I have to say?  10 Good Morning, 15 Hillbilly, 20 Merkins, 25 Side Straddle Hops

### Thang 1 - muscles

- Grab a partner and both grab a rock
- 100 Curls / 100 Tricep Extensions / 100 Should Presses - alternating 10 reps while your accountability partner makes sure you're doing good reps.
- While your partner does his reps do rock squats / overhead rock hold / squats
- mumblechatter about eye level during squats was pleasant.

### Thang 2 - cardio

- Circle up with your rock, big circle.
- Welcome the Burpee Carousel (with a Jack Web Twist)
- Everyone start on the right of your rock, jump your rock once and do a burpee, then 4 rock rows.
- Now shift to the next rock, do 2 jump rock burpees around the carousel, then 8 rock rows.
- Then do 3 jump rock burpees, then 12 rock rows.
- We went up to 6 and put the rocks back

### Thang 3 - Endurance

- Run to the bridge, stop at the railings.
- CALLAHAN WAS FIRST ONE THERE!!  GUY IS A BEEEEEEAST!!!!!!!!!
- 10 Hand Release Merkins at the start
- Run to middle of birdge
- 10 Star Jumps
- Run to end of railing on the other side of bridge
- 10 Monkey Humpers
- Now keep going for 15 minutes! (I think it was more like 10ish)
- Chanticleer dominated and got up and over 4 or 5 times.  Let's check with Strava.

Pin-up served 30 years in the fire department.  We asked him what month he was in the ole sexy firemen calendar and that's how he got the name Pin-up.  He worked hard, had an awesome attitude, is a #Respect, and I hope he continues to show!!  He's my grandson so maybe I'm bias.  Thank you for your leadership, Hermes getting him out there!
