According to The Free Dictionary the idiom "Have \_\_\_\_ , will travel" is used when one has the ability or skill to do something and could do it anywhere. While rock carrying, or in this case indian running with rocks, is not a skill that most of us set out to develop we can use a discipline such as this to develop toughness and belief within ourselves. Today 10 HIMs declared "I have rocks and I can take them anywhere". And so we did.

The F3 mission was shared, the Pledge of Allegiance was said (thank you Pigeon for providing the shovel-flag) and then traveling rocks were gathered. Circling up we listened to the motivational message by titled You vs Them to put ourselves in the right frame of mind to go do something hard.
