If it's after a weekend event that is likely to have worn the PAX out, it means YHC has signed up for the Kryptonite Q. Did the post-BBR Q last year & had signed up for the post-Carying Place Q this year as well. So nothing different this year with the Odyssey just behind us. A nice easy Krypto to bring the legs back is just up YHC's alley.

But then last night I got to worrying that with most of the guys avoiding [Flip's Krypto Q last week](https://f3carpex.com/2019/09/30/whats-your-kryptonite-part-ii/) for [relaxation with Franklin](https://f3carpex.com/2019/10/03/franklinaversary-5th-edition/) there could be a pent up demand for miles and miles. Yikes! Better check out Slack to see what Wonderbread is threatening.

Luckily all I saw was a HC from the Nantan and a request for this to be another easy-peasy Pierogi Q. Even Staubach was coming! No worries. That I am sure I can deliver.

So instead of spending hours reviewing past backblasts (all 7 of them, mostly from Burt), a quick visit to Caltopo to figure out how big that bigass parking lot really is and we're all set. The bigger question is what would today's soundtrack include?

### Warm-up

Serpentine run to the starting point.  
SSH, Fazios, Merkins, plankjacks

### Thang

See map below. Idea was for three circuits. We got in 1.5. Burpees and Alphabets take some time.
