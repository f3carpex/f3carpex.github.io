We had a couple of visitors from out of town this morning, Monk from F3 The Capital (and before that Gastonia), and Red Baron from wherever Living Legends come from.

**Warm-Up** Disclaimer and Pledge, mosey around the parking lot and grab some curb for three rounds of quick feet and curb irkens, then to the top of the deck and circle up for cherry pickers, arm twirlies, seal claps, hillbillies and a round of Good Mornings expertly led by Crimson.

**The Thang** Mosey to the end of the deck and partner up. One partner alternates ten irkens and ten derkins, one partner runs to the end of the deck for ten merkins and runs back, three rounds each.

Down to the lower deck and cross the lot as group, lunge walking on YHC's 1-2-3, with Hello Kitty calling out ascending squats in between. We got up to 16.

Staying on the lower deck for fifties. Bear crawl out, 40 LBCs, bear crawl back, 10 Homer-to-Marge, repeato decreasing LBCs and increasing H-t-M by ten each trip.

Still a little time left, so back to the top deck for a few sprints, All You Got the first half, recovery mosey the second half.

**Mary** Circle up on the bottom deck and go around the circle for Eskimo kisses, American hammers, low slow flutters, burpees, LBCs and Have A Nice Day.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  28 **Name-a-rama**:  6 RESPECT, 21 meh, 1 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for Magoo, his family, and everyone serving with him. He's deploying to Iraq soon, we'll continue to pray for him, and look forward to seeing him again next year. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS** This group was big and chatty. I was focused on my duties and missed most of it, I'm sure it was all positive.

It was great to have Frisco and his 2.0 SuperCell out this morning. The young man gave us a couple of the best ten counts I've ever heard, and even led us through American hammers during Mary. Impressive kid, impressive dad.

We're all proud to be out there with Magoo on his last post before deploying. We couldn't do what we do if guys like him didn't do what they do. God bless you, brother.

It's a blessing to start my day with this group of inspiring men, thank you for letting me lead.
