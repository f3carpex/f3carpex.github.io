Wahoo got a little over zealous training for the BRR and hurt his foot. He asked that I swap Q's for Point Break with him (3/4 for 3/11). Since it was about time to shave my winter beard, I decided there was no need to update the Q sheet. I borrowed Wahoo's shirt with "Wahoo's Fish Tacos" on it and showed up. I really liked a rock suicide workout that Term Paper did a few weeks ago. I thought that workout would be even better with some kettlebells.

Started with the pledge and then mosey over to parking lot near Whole Foods.

#### Warm Up

- Daisy Pickers
- Imperial Walkers

#### Thang 1 - Catch Me If You Can

Mosey over to medical building parking garage. Partnered up. Five laps of Catch Me if You Can with 10 Merkins each time you were caught.

#### Thang 2 - Island Hopping

Mosey to my van which had a good 25 bells in the back. One bell per partner pair. For each of the seven islands in the parking lot, I had a sign which had a different bell exercise. Partner 1 bare crawled the next island and ran back. Partner 2 AMRAPed whatever exercise was on the current island. Once both partners finished the exercise on the island, they ran to the next island. We did two rounds. Bear crawls between islands on the way out and lung walk on the way back.
