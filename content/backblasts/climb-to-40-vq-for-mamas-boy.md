**Pre-pledge:**

Nature called for Snots. Fortunately, he brought a roll of TP. Mama's Boy shared a silly song on being stranded without TP, and also the proper technique for disposing of waste if one finds himself high up on mountain rock with nowhere to dig: either pack it out or smear thinly. Leave no PAX behind - same with turds in the alpine.

**Pledge, then mosey to lot 1 for the first thang:** - good mornings, arm circles, windmills, plank, merkins

**Mosey to thang 2 under large shelter:** - table step-ups alternating on your own (40) - incline scorpion merkins (5, switch, 5) - dips (40) - \[PAX began to grumble\] - pole squat hold (40 seconds)

**Mosey to thang 3 to the hill:** - sets of hill climbers at the bottom (10-20-30-40) - sets of side-straddle-hops at the top (40-30-20-10) - hill run between sets

**Mosey to thang 4 - rock pit:** - stationary rock gather - 40 curls - 25 overhead presses - 25 skull crunches - one more set of 15 for each

**Mosey to thang 5 - basketball court** - circle merks (10)

**Two lines of Indian run mosey back to lot 1:** - 40 LBCs - have a nice day

**Announcements:** Sooey pop-up post tomorrow at Bounty Hunter spot; Green Mile, others

**Mama's Boy shared a quote from "unknown":** _"To be human is to embrace change. There are parts of you waiting to die and parts of you waiting to be born. You are never broken, never truly lost, always becoming."_

Mama's Boy closed with a prayer.
