The Q for Lion's Den remained unfufilled and I hadn't Q'd on the home turf in sometime so I took the opportunity. 10 Pax gathered at the flag with no FNG's although with the winter gear on some were more distinguishable than others. A quick pledge and we're off.

## Tour of Lights Mosey

I had promised Coxswain a view of my neighbor's Star Wars Christmas display as a perk to coming to Lion's Den earlier in the week on Slack, alas he picked up the Q at Point Break so wasn't with us -- I decided to go through with the tour anyhow. A colder morning calls for an extended warm up anyway. Theismann didn't realize he needed to start his Strava, I still need to go back and tag him so he gets credit.

There was some mumble grumbling about lack of lights on the tour, then I hit them with this:![Star Wars Christmas Palooza](images/IMG_4335-1.jpeg)
