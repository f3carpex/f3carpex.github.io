Hot and fresh from the BRR interest/info meeting held by Hot Spot the night before I had fond memories of Old Maid's Vesper Q from way back in the year 2017. So with vests, lamps and batons in hand we did what all great men do. Stand on the backs of those before us to reach new heights, ahem elevations?

**Warm up:**

- 10x - GM's IC
- 20x SSH IC
- 10x - Windmills IC
- 10x - IW IC
- 10x KDK IC

**The Thang:**

In the style of the BRR we had 6 men. 5 of them are in "The Van" and run off to rendezvous(hey spell check!) with the runner. The runner who is donning ppe gear and the baton takes off in the opposite direction. When the runner and the van crew rendezvous they all do

- 1 Murcan, 1 frog-up & 1 squat. (poor mans burpee)

The next runner swaps ppe gear and baton and were all off again to the next point. At each rendezvous point the exercise count increases by 1 until we get to 12 reps, The Top of the Mountain. Then we count back down by 1. We got to 11 before time ran out and we decided we like mountain life and moved in.

See strava link below for route info. (maybe if it works who knows?)

**COT:**

**Announcements:**

BRR - Sign up for a team by 2-1 (I'd dare say it's the premier F3 event outside of typical work outs)

K2C - still time to sign up!

Prayer Concerns - Those spoken and unspoken

**BOM:**

YHC led us in prayer.

**NMS:**

Really excited to be training for an event again. Kinda slacked off last year and it's really hurt the performance. Largemouth noted that he was disappointed that we didn't do a Cary Run Club Q. Let me get my wheels back brother and we will.Â  #SYITG
