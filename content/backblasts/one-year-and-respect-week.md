Celebrated Respect Week and my one year anniversary in F3. My first year has been highlighted with a VQ, a Thanksgiving and New Year Convergence, COVID restrictions, Virtual Workouts, a Maynard, BRR training/relay, the Odyssey, and the development of friendships and personal growth.  
It was a cool evening and 10 PAX (also 2.0's Sonic & Tails) , 2 dogs, and a visiting PAX Poncherello (works at Cary Police 911 and we often see him going to work when we are waiting. He usually works out in Wake Forest). Well, it was actually 9 to start. Orphan was running late. Orphan EH'd me, but was not able to make my first post, it would be appropriate for him to make my anniversary Q.  
  
\- No FNG's; forgot mission statement; said the Pledge; and then mosey to the top of the old parking deck. My first post was Q'd my Red Ryder, so I tried to recreate that Q with some modifications.  
  
**Warm Up**

- Good Evenings Nice and slow
- Imperial Walkers, well it started out Hillbilly's and corrected by Burt. Still get nervous when Q'ing.
- Mountain climbers/calf stretch
- Control Freak Merkins
- SSH
- Down the ramp to the blocks waiting on Cary St.

- **Thang 1**:  **Blockorama**  
    - Set 1: At the bottom of the hill- 10 curls & 10 tris run to the top of the hill 2 burpos.  Repeat this pattern descending by 2 and ascending by 2 until 2 curls/tris and 10 burpos.
    - Set 2: Same pattern with 10 rows/presses and 2 WW merkins. Moved to the parking lot where there was betting lighting. Orphan finally joined us, sorry Disco forgot about penalty burpee's. Also saw F3 Big Red?? (I think) in the parking lot going home.
    - Blocks to the truck

- **Thang 2**
    - Mosey to finest grass in DTC  
    - Face short wall; 5 wall jump burpees; bear crawl across lawn; 4 wall jump burpees- Frankenstein across lawn; 3 wall jumps-carioca across lawn; 2 wall jumps- at least 3 cartwheels across to the final 1 wall jump burpee. That was entertaining. I had not done a cartwheel in forever and it showed. John Belushi and Chris Farley always made it look so easy.  
        

- **Mary**

- Hello Dolly's
- Low, slow Flutter
- Nolan Ryan's
- Peter Parker's
- Some type of superman stretch from Orphan
- 100's from Burt
- and pretty sure I'm missing something

  
**Theresa**: Stretches for legs and hips

- **Count off, Name-o-rama**: 4 Respects; 1 Hate; 5 Meh's; 2 dogs; 2 2.0's
- **COT**: Prayers for Burt's neighbor diagnosed with cancer; Sonic's friend who has COVID; WWW's job situation; healing for BaB; Kwik Stop's job search; Disco Duck's MIL; YHC's in-law's.
- **Ball of Man**:  Took a knee.
- **NMS:** Some stayed and enjoyed a beverage around my truck. Press On nailed it when he said it was better than Coffeeteria. Brief moment of anxiety when a Cary PO walked to his car. It's good to have Orphan around in case we need counsel. Stayed late and had a great conversation with WWW, the benefits of F3 were discussed. It has been a year that has rejuvenated me physically, mentally, and spiritually. Thanks for being a positive light in an otherwise difficult year.
