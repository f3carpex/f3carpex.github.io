**12 HIMs rocked, rocked ‘til we nearly dropped on a steamy Monday morning at Hells Bells.**

**Warm up**

A quick mosey around the parking lot as Quiet Riot’s “Cum on feel the noize” started our morning of Hair Metal glory.

- SSHs
- Sir Fazios – front and back
- Michael Phelps
- Good Mornings
- Ernie Davis Heisman’s

**The Thang**

Mosey to the shelter. YHC had a dozen cards with a kettlebell exercise on each one – the PAX took turns selecting the respective exercises. In no particular order, 20 reps of each exercise were completed. In between exercises, the PAX ran around the pickle, while bruisers walked the circle.

- Goblet squats
- LBC to press
- Swings
- Figure 8s
- Tricep extension
- Halos
- Bent over rows (20 on each side)
- Rock your bodies
- Step ups
- High pulls
