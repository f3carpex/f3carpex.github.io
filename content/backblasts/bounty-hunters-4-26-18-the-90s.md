19 PAX came out to hear the greatest tunes of the '90's but, alas, YHC did not realize the charge only lasts a day.  So only the birds accompanied us in our endeavors.

Off for a quick lap around the lacrosse field to circle up in the skate park for warm-ups.

Warm-up

Side Straddle Hop, Good Mornings, Sir Fazio Arm Circles, Merkins

Fellowship run to the Apex Town Parking Lot.

Thing 1

The PAX partnered up for Dora 1-2-3 and paint the lines.

100 merkins, 200 LBCs, 300 Squats
