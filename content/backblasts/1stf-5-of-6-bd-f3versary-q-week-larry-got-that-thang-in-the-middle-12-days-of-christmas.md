BO holds a dear place in my heart because it was the 2ndpost I’ve done when I started in F3.  Ma Bell was the Q and I got my introduction to the 12 Days of Christmas.  12 Days of Christmas is to spur happiness and gift giving.  OH NO!!!!  It provided pain and fatigue.  I had to bring it back for the nostalgia it brings.

0545 start – I introduced my Co-Q Franklin who DM me earlier in the week to Co-Q because he had to fulfill the role at BO to complete his leadership challenge.  I gladly agreed.  Proud of you Brother for your leadership!  After the intro, Franklin led the group on a mosey to the bank for warm-ups.  SSH for 12, GM for 12, Merkins for 12, Sir Fazio for 12, etc.  After every exercise, he kept referring to the # count.  Clue for the themed workout.  With warm-ups complete, we mosey’d over to the Ashworth parking lot where Franklin handed the PAX over to me to begin the thang; hence, thang in the middle.

I pulled out my speaker to get the music the Christmas mode started and brought out the weinkes.  I let the PAX know our task in the gloom is to spread cheer with the 12 Days of Christmas.  Broke the PAX up into 4 groups.  Each group was to stay together in the theme of no man left behind and always picking up the 6.

1st:  A lap around the pickle

2nd:  2 Catalina Wine Maker

3rd: 3 Mountain Climber Merkins

4th:  4 Prisoner Squats

5th: 5 Burpees

6th: 6 Imperial Walkers

7th:  7 Star Jumps or Jump Squats

8th:  8 Monkey Humpers

9th:  9 Hello Dolly’s

10th: 10 Boat Canoes

11th:  11 Diamond Merkins

12th: 12 Carolina Dry Docks

After we spread cheer, pain and fatigue we mosey’d back to the parking lot for Mary which I turned the PAX over to Franklin to do.

Mary: Freddie Mercs for 12; LBC for 12; Rosalita for 12 which was a special request from the PAX; WWII for 12
