I like this AO site...there's a reason it hosts 3 of CARPEX's workouts every week. I posted a bit early to scout the site for my ideas, said farewell to the EC bubbas and headed into the Gloom of Apex Community Park. I had originally planned on the Dora encompassing the loop from the pavilion all the way around the utility access trail and back through the parking lots (approx. .6 miles around); instead, I changed the route to head back towards the bridge and back. When pointing out "the bridge" when we ran over it (even though it's not a bridge), it was graciously pointed out to me that I'm dumb and they've always called it "the bridge." I'm still new here, back off folks!
