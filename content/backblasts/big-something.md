5 Pax: Asystole, Banjo, Disco Duck, Flip Flop, Yogi

 

BIG SOMETHING

 

Over the train tracks and past Bond Brothers to the first shady area for warm-up:  Disco Duck's favorite SSH, good pm, windmill,  mtn climber, 10 merkins oyo, asst leg and arm stretches.

 

Enough listening to Yogi complain about the mosquitos. Mosey over to east side park for half Cindy: 10 rounds of 5 pull ups, 10 merkins, 15 squats.

 

Recover on jog to Wonk's front yard for some ab work, in cadence and REALLY LOUD: American Hammers and something.

 

Mosey back to “3 flag start” with stops on the way for squats.

 

Circle up for 2 rounds of pax lead speed mary.

 

Shoes off and circle up for COT with feet in the fountain. Just ask Yogi and Flip Flop, this is the best kept COT secret in F3.

 

YHC took us out in prayer.

 

It was a pleasure men

 

Like the band “Anonymous” that is now a “BIG SOMETHING”, so is Rush Hour
