**BLIMPS Challenge -** Run to the parking lot with the hill for the BLIMPS challenge.  Round 1 was 5 of each exercise (Burpees, Lunges, Imperial Walkers, Merkins, Plank Jacks, and Star Jumps.)  First round called and the time was 2:39.  Pax didn't know I was timing it as I needed a real benchmark.   Next round called with 6 of each exercise.  Round must be under 2:39 or penalty burpees for each second late.  Everyone got back in time!  Round 3 - 7 reps, Round 4 8 - reps with 2 penalty burpees.  New time 2:41 and 10 reps for the final round.  9 penalty burpees and recover.

Run back to the parking lot.  Stop for a set of go gos called out by Mic.

I briefly shared the beginning of Philippians 3:8**.** It is a helpful reminder for me in my struggles to know how to spend my time and to not worry about daily annoyances.

_8 Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ_

Prayers for Wonderbread and his back. Hope you heal up quickly!

- Flip Flop and Pierogi were late and bummed gas money.
- Squatter had some cash.  He does sell drugs, I mean, pharmacy services for a living.
- What does GTL stand for?
- Go UK or go Dawgs?
- Mic, did I make the team?
- Shout out to Blue Water for hanging in there and staying with my challenge.
- Why was there a cop in the woods?

Thanks for the chance to lead!
