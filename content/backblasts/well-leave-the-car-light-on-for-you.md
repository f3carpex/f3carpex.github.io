When I saw Slappy’s note go out requesting someone pick up Lion’s Den for him I was ecstatic. He had said he was feeling sick but would still Q if no one took it. That sounded like a recipe for some sloppy Slappy merlot and I wanted a second row seat for it.

Then Slappy DM-ed me a personal photo of mine I had uploaded to GroupMe back when I thought it was a just private storage site (Thanks a lot, Sub!). Thus I found myself picking up the Lion’s Den Q.

Technically, I had been banned from posting at LD after that time I ran through the adjacent neighborhood yelling at the top of my lungs trying to wake dogs and babies. But Q-ing isn’t technically posting so I felt it was a gray area.

Next I had to come up with a workout. Luckily WWW has been Q-ing every week this year as some sort of personal goal. He has done the same workout every week so I knew the PAX would know it. So I pilfered that, upped the count on the easy exercises and swapped out (forgot) monkey humpers for merkins.

Warm up:

Short mosey around the parking lot

Good mornings

Not Control Freak merkins

Burpees

The Thang: B.L.I.M.P.S Ladder (Partner)

First I had the PAX partner up and then sent the P1s in one direction and the P2s in the other. When partners cross paths they can share the exercise at that station

Burpees (10 to 5)

LBC (25, 20, 15, 10, 5)

Imperial Walker (25, 20, 15, 10, 5)

Merkins (25, 20, 15, 10, 5)

Plank Destroyer (Catalina wine maker, shoulder taps, plank jack) (25, 20...)
