I mean the AO has SW right in its initials. Too easy.

_[Playlist](https://itunes.apple.com/us/playlist/sww-5-4/pl.u-zPyLl9YFo3JDk)_

After emerging from the gloom to the Imperial March, an FNG check resulted in all experienced PAX. Let's go!

 

Run over toward the greenway. Circle up in the lot for the warmup:

25 **S**SH

20 **I**W

15 **T**empo Merkins

10 **H**illbillies

 

WELCOME TO DAGOBAH. Partner up. Luke will carry Yoda to the baseball field. Flipflop as many times as needed.

 

Time to explore the Four Corners of the galaxy featuring 20 each of:

**J**ump Squats in right field

**E**2Ks in center field (10 each side)

**D**iamond Merkins in left field

**I**nchworm back into the infield

Repeato with 10 reps and Imperial Walkers instead of Inchworms.

 

Mosey around the side of the field to the end of the LONG parking lot. Split into two groups.

 

WELCOME TO HOTH

Group 1 - start _[AT-AT](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/All_Terrain_Armored_Transport)_ crawling across the lot. Go all the way to the end.

Group 2 - X wing suicides. 10 star jumps at one end, run and do 2 circles around the PAX (or single out a PAX or two if there is some divergence). Return to the start. 10 star jumps and run back to the crawling PAX for 2 more loops. Repeato until the PAX finish the lot (or you have toppled the AT-ATs).

Flipflop and repeat back to the start.

Repeat the whole thing but with Lungewalks instead of Bearcrawls (or just modify back to bearcrawls if you're a dang beast). It was still a valid _[visual](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/All_Terrain_Scout_Transport)_.

 

Mosey back to the flag, stopping at the baseball field fence for BTTW and PC.

 

At the flag, Mary consisting of:

LBC IC // Merkins OMD // WW2s OMU // Wide Grip Merkins OMD // Freddy Mercs IC

HAND

THAT'S IT

 

COR - 11

NOR - 2 RESPECTS, 5 mehs, 4 HATES

Prayer Requests/Praises

Jigglypuff has a job interview next week. Feels like an opening door, pray for good stewardship of the opportunity.

LOOK AT THAT HATE COUNT! Thank you, gimmicks!

Top props to Hello Kitty for the idea for the Battle of Hoth. Killer visual (gave Hermes those 1980 vibes). There was a rope at one end of the lot, but that may have been hazardous/too literal. Gotta keep it slightly abstract.

Aw snap, I just realized that I moved a traffic marker in the parking lot, didn't end up using it, and never moved it back. Bad Q!

Who was the real villain today: Bob the cigar dude for relegating Joe with Joe to the bench/pavement, or that BMW dude who nearly claimed the Battle of Hoth for himself by "asserting dominance" and flattening the PAX? Many disturbances felt in the gloom this morning.

May the fourthce be with you.

See you at FWD next Tuesday... for May the Hate-th! #preblast?
