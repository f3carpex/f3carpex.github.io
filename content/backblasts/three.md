YHC celebrates Three Years with F3 today. I had to Q, and Tortoises - where I used to be site Q - was the perfect place for it.

My pre-blast promised Threes, Burpees, Merkins, and Music. We accomplished that.  
  
Left Cheek and I pulled up at the same time. I hadn't met him before, but I could tell immediately that he is a HIM. We talked for a few minutes, then I ECP-ed some pullups to get rid of energy before the rest of the PAX showed up.

It was great to see @WWW fly by and plant the flag - but was sorry to see him leave for work before we started ... he was overdressed anyway.  
  
First exercise was The Pledge of Allegiance, then we moseyed over to the side entrance of the church for...  
  
**Warmup**  
3 slow good mornings  
13 ssh

**Thang 1**  
It seemed like part of warmups but was actually the first Thang:  
3 burpees  
followed by a mosey to do 10 more burpees,  
followed by a mosey to do 10 more burpees,  
followed by a mosey to do 10 more burpees.

\[inspired by @PetSounds - for his 2020 100 burpee/day challenge\]  

**Thang 2**

As "Get Down On It" song played we planked and did a merkin on each 'Get Down'

2 Respects Present  
  
**NMS**  
Thanks to Dana Smith - Chinese Downhill for inviting me several times to F3 before I finally became a regular. And he co-Q-ed my first post in Nashville, NC (with F3 Gilligan) on our children's wedding day. My daughter married Dana's son three years ago.  
My son-in-law F3 Brodie named me - glad he gave me something good!

F3 has been life-changing. I've led much more than I ever have in my life. From leading workouts, becoming a site Q, and Carpex's QSource go-to. This is stuff I never thought that I would do. Thanks to @Callahan Some of what I've done has been captured at TheMuggo.com:
