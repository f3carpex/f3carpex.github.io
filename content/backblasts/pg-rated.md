**A**

  

I happened to check Slack at around 9:30PM Saturday night and notice a Riptide post looking for a co-Q for Phoenix Saturday morning. I jumped on and decided to help Rip make his daughter’s Soccer game for which Hermès never stopped talking about for 30 min. Speaking of Hermès, many were happy they left the 2.0’s at home cause old Hermz was in rare but normal form. He did apologize during the prayer LOL! All good fun!

Riptide disclaimed us and away we went heading toward the community center. We warmed up with a few movement I don’t really recall expect for the Homer 2 Marge where Riptide promised us a more detailed breakdown of the movement at the end, yet left us hanging. Looking forward to Riptide finishing his H2M teachings at a later time. He sent the Pax over to pick up a traveling Rock for each group of 2. Triple Lindy and I partnered up and we headed to the boathouse passing other rock piles along the way.

**Thang 1 and 2 1/2**

Bear Crawl half the Pickle mosey and lunges on the backside while partner 2 did Dying La-cookarachas. This is where Hermès went rogue on us lying next to Riptide. We did several rounds of this, total number unknown. We also did something else, but I don’t remember because I was too busy thinking about taking over as Q and whether or not to take the PAX all the way over to the lakeside rockpile just to piss them off. But... time did not allow for that so after Riptide turned the keys over we headed to the Kiosk for some partner 7’s up the hill. I made this call with Frisco in mind and completely baffled the PAX. One partner at the bottom with the Rock squatting and the other up the hill for Merkins. Anyway the figured it out and order was restored.

After delivering the rocks back to their home we Billy’d Back to the flag way too soon in my opinion. Mary went on forever it seemed with the Pax all calling a Mary. “Have a Nice Day” was my last call with about 2 min left. That seemed to bother Smokey who was walking around. Total disorder here!

We prayed for Crimson’s family and Disco Duck (no abbreviated names here) delivered the prayer.

Not bad for 4 days later right?
