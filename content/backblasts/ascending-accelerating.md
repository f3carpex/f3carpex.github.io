YHC is not gonna lie when I say that I thoroughly enjoyed fartsacking this morning with the knowledge that I had the Q at this evening's Rush-Hour. 3 PAX showed up at the greatest evening AO in all of Carpex on a Tuesday! No FNGs, so straight into the pledge we go...

**Warmup**:

Mosey around the parking lot where we were able to locate the CPD K9 unit! Circle up in the back corner of the lot for:

SSH IC x 20

Good Evenings IC x 10

Sir Fazio Arm Circles IC x 10 forward & backward

Seal Claps IC x 10

Imperial Walkers IC x 10

Plank Jacks IC x 10

Calf Stretch L/R x silent 10 count

**Thang 1:**

Mosey over to the Wilkinson Ave. entrance to the parking deck for the wonderful opportunity to check the whole thing out.

2 burpees at the bottom. Run each straight stretch adding 2 burpees at the turn all the way to the top. Some balls to the wall and a couple of 10 counts and we were ready to unstack it starting at 10 jump squats at the top, subtracting 2 all the way back to the start. The PAX helped a damsel in distress (with parking) and then headed back to the top with Peter Parker Merkins this time. Just 1 10 count and back down subtracting with some jump lunges this time.

**Thang 2:**

Mosey to the lovely, serene field next to the fountain. There the PAX executed the Dan Taylor, 1 time across with LBCs IC x 10 on the sidewalk. 2 times across followed by Freddie Mercury IC x 10 on the walkway. 3 times back and forth followed by box cutters IC x 10. QIC was tired of doing lunges so decided to change things up a bit. Bear crawl across the grass for a round of Jack Webb. Back and forth the PAX crawled adding a round each time to 5 total. Slow mosey back to the fountain side for Mary.

**Mary**:

Flutter kicks IC x 10

100s

Pamela Anderson IC x 10 (Thanks Kermit)

American Hammer IC x 10

L elbow to R knee IC x 10

R elbow to L knee IC x 10

Pickle Pounder IC x 10

Have a nice evening

**Announcements**:

Christmas Party 12/12

South Wake CSAUP 12/7

**Prayers/Praises:**

Let us all pray for Kermit's 1.0 Bob who has been struggling with pain and soreness from a lifetime of hard labor which prevents him from sleeping well.

**NMS**:

It's always a pleasure to lead the PAX in a workout, whether its 3 or 30. I feel as though I'm finally at a point where I don't need a full plan to pull off a Q. I find myself eager to learn from other QICs to expand my personal exicon as it were. Thank you all for being an audience to my whims.
