This was YHC's first time out Qing Gran Torino. After studying the mess out of Google Maps the plan was set. YHC drove to up a few minutes before the normal 10min early mark YHC tries to hit, checked out the parking lot and saw the gates needed to get to where we were going today were locked soooo, change of plans!
