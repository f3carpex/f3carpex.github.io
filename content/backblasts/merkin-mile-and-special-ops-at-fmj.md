YHC will hit the road on Friday not to return until New Year's Eve, so with that, one more chance to Q a beatdown and to FMJ for the work. Sgt. Kitty reporting for duty (he said duty).

A group of HIMtastic men joined for some EC at 0505. Ma Bell, Parker, Snots, Water Wings and Old Maid, you were there. Tclaps for ensuring we checked the correct mileage to and fro the track.

Pax met in the gloom and with four shovel-flags in hand we headed out.

**Warmup** by making our way to the open lot for:

- SSH
- Mountain Climbers
- Merkin because, Ma Bell
- Sir Fazio both ways
- And a good morning to touch it off

**Thang 1:**

- Merkin Mile on GroupMe? Great idea, Old Maid!
- 4 laps around the track with 25 Merkin at the end of each lap
- 1 mile, 100 Merkins, nicely done men. Recover.

**Thang 2:**

- As promised we're here today to celebrate the branches of our United States Military
- As a Pax we ran the track stopping at a shovel flag (as was intended) at each corner.
- Corner 1: Air Force for Super Man and Plane/Plank position for some flight pattern exercises
- Corner 2: Army for some soldier crawls to the soccer goal, some squats, and some lunges (keep those riffles extended) back to the corner.
- Corner 3 (after a pit stop for some L/R step ups at the benches): Marines charge hard and an all-you-got to Corner 4
- Corner 4: In honor of the Navy SEALS, frog man jumps to the soccer goal. Oh hey, it's 0545(ish) and here comes Flacco. 15 penalty burpees OYO.
- Since Sgt. Flacco was late, YHC would hate for him to miss out on the fun, so a Repeato of the four corners. Tclaps the the aptly named Water Wings for taking the Pax through the flight patterns this time and it was Merkins at the benches because, again, Ma Bell.
- Oh wait, oh wait, we can't forget about the Coast Guard, so flags to the center of the field for a hearty round of boat-canoes with Admiral Banjo.
- To close it out YHC hit the PAX with a quick feet to Burpee count that saw a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Merkin count on the Burpees and then back down 4,3,2,1. Recover here for now.

COT: 14 Special Ops Hims.

YHC took us out... oh and let's grab those flags and mosey (about half a mile) back to the flag.

NMS:

- Tclaps to Shank for the Qssies.
- WKRP, sorry I let you down and we only logged 2.8 miles... (should have hit that EC)
- I love you guys. Hoorah, oohrah, hooyah and whatever the Air Force and Coast Guard say...
