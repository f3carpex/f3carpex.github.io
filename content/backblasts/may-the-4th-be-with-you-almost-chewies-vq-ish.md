Roughly a week ago YHC approached Kwik Stop and was like, “Hey Dude, want to come-up with a workout and Co-Q? at Tin2Iron?” In which the response that I heard was, “heck yeah” (or something like that...). So here we are. 

I woke-up at 3 a.m. with some major sciatic pain which helped me remember I forgot to charge the surround sound system for today’s beat down which still died in the middle of the workout and I had to plug the speaker into my vehicle. 

Kwik Stop and YHC got to the site early and set up the fun. 10 HIM showed up looking at us with curiosity and dismay on what we had in store. 

Kwik Stop gave the mission statement and disclosure and we were off. 

**WARM-UP**

10x SF Arm Circles, forward and backwards

10 count calf stretch both legs

10 merkins

**THE THANG** 

May the 4th Be With You - Almost (or its working name, "When Dirty Bomb met Frisco...A Love Story”).

The workout was modeled after a High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) TABATA. The goal was to get the PAX vo2 levels up and down between circuits. Repeat twice. 

The workout consisted of 8 stations with two different exercises which makes up one circuit. PAX paired up and picked a station. One PAX chose one of the two exercises while the other did the other exercise for 40 seconds. There was a 10 second rest where the PAX switch exercises at the station and did the next workout for 40 seconds ending. After each PAX did both workouts at the station there was a 25 second break to give enough time to move to the next station. 

Station 1: Curls for Girls and Kick Backs with dumbbells or kettlebells (25#, 20# or 15#) PAX choice

Station 2: Goblet squats with 20# kettle bell and Step-ups or Box Jumps on picnic tables

Station 3: Pull-ups (band for assistance if needed) and Bear crawls up the hill

Station 4: Bench press 75# (thanks for the toy Kwik Stop) and Merkins 

Station 5: Battle rope and Sgt. Squatters (Thanks Frisco)

Station 6: Tire flip and Dutch Skaters 

Station 7: IYT and Shoulder Press with 15# dumbbell or 25# kettlebell or pavers PAX choice

Station 8:  Wall Balls with 10# ball and Balls to the Wall

During the exercise Dirty Bomb kept reminding that YHC missed like the Pledge at the beginning and to not forget a Mary at the end. 

**MARY**

Supermans, LBCs, American Hammers, more LBCs, Kwik Stop called his favorite Eskimo Merkins and finished with Homer to Marge. 

**COT**

Added the Pledge of Allegiance. (I know I forgot it at the beginning - TYFYL Dirty Bomb).

I hope everyone liked the workout. It was fun to plan and implement with Kwik Stop. I can’t wait till I can plan another.

July 4 is one of my favorite holidays. Be safe and take a second to remember those who committed treason in the eye of the crown for our freedom.

Happy Independence (REAL) Day! - the 2nd Continental Congress actually voted and declared independence from the crown today in 1776.
