Kryponite  was my 1st Carpex Post so why not go back to where it all started for my VQ to see how much I have improved from that cold January beat down.  The adrenaline/nerves were high as we started 30 seconds early with a mosey to the large parking lot by the Koka booth entrance.  I had one thing in mind for the 14 PAX who joined me on this adventure and that was high tempo.   3.5 miles later I think we achieved my goal.

Warm up

- Good morning  X 20 - no recovery
- LBJ's  X  20 - Really meant to call LBC's  but as I said the nerves were high
- Side Straddle Hop's  X 20  voice inflection was off and no recovery
- American Hammers X 20  - maybe got the cadence correct, voice inflections was off and I  don't think I called recovery.

Thang 1

Partner up for catch me if you can to the very end of the parking lot (where they do Camp Gladiator) with 5 Carolina Dry Docks.  We also did a few Burpees OYO just to keep us moving.

Thang 2

Mosey over to the Regency parking lot to Circle up again before we do 7's on the Hill.

- 10 LBC's or i may have called LBJ's I don"t remember - no recovery and cadence was off
- 10 Merkins - may be got the inflection right but no recovery.
- 10 Monkey Humpers

Thang 3

We did 7's on the hill with Merkins on the bottom and Monkey Humpers on the top while each time we completed the pickle.
