Showed up at FWD with shovel flag in hand and time to plant it. Its a crisp morning, but thank God the rain has passed and we have a clear sky above. Someone pointed out the space station which passes directly overhead right at 5:45 to kick off our workout this morning. With temps in the 40's  9 eager Pax are ready to get moving to stay warm so we head to the circle in front of the park to warm up.

I shared the scripture, Hebrews 4:14-16 "14 Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven,\[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+4%3A11%E2%80%9316#fen-NIV-30029a "See footnote a")\]Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess. 15 For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin. 16 Let us then approach God’s throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.

We don't always know what we will have to face today or tomorrow, but when the crap hits the fan we can always trust God for the Mercy and Grace to help us in our time of desperate need. Put your trust in Him today or share it with someone in need.

 

As always its an awesome honor to be given the opportunity to lead these fine men this morning,

 

Fluoride
