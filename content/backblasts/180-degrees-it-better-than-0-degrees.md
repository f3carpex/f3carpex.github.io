Cold.  Windy.  Tuesday.  Q showed up early for a little recon.  5:30 and we are off

Warmup

- Repeato......AUDIBLE after Squat jumps.  Circled the PAX and exited the field.  PAX informed that their Legs were warm
- Made our way out of the site parking lot and over towards "Michelob's Hill" .  Old Maid informed me that the hill was "closed", we crossed anyways.  "Stupid Millennials think they are invisible."  Anywho, kept running....HALT...Burpees10X OYO..
- Made our way across the parking lot, through the two circles in front of the school, over to another Hill.  Not sure if this Hill has a name, however Banjo made us do 11's once on said Hill and it was miserable.
- Stopped at bottom of hill and explained the deal.  7's. 1/2 Surfer Merkins at the Top(180degree jump followed by Merkin, Monkey Jumpers(like humpers but with a Jump) at the bottom.  Yes, I dug deep on the Exicon yesterday....BTW, 1/2 Surfers were called because I can't do a Full... Your'e Welcome
- Merlot was almost spilled by Khakis, who is fresh off a cold....apparently the Surfers combined with Monkey Jumpers are no beuno for your Virtigo.
- Exited the hill and headed back.  Stopped at Circle.  Instructed PAX to run around the circle and each time back at start complete 2x Knee Ups..increasing by 2 on each lap.  Some made it to 10, others to 12.  Great job!
- Left the circle and moseyed back.  Included some backwards runs along the way.
- Entered site parking lot for Round Da Circle Mary.  Lets see if I can remember them all
