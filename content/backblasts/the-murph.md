The day immediately following a Maynard Run is usually reduced attendance, and today is no different. Six HIMs felt the call and posted regardless!

Gorgeous weather this morning, and I wasn't the only one still nursing minor aches and pains from yesterday's Maynard. 7:15, time to start. No FNGs, so two brief laps around the pickle followed by a quick Warm-Up

- 20 SSH
- 5 Good Mornings
- 20 Merkins OMD
- 20 Squats OMD

The Murph!!

- Run to Ritter PArk (aka Slippery When Wet) which is conveniently just a hair over one mile away.
- 100 Pullups
- 200 Merkins
- 300 squats
- Run back to the AO

We got back in time for a couple of rounds of Mary, and a parking lot full of folks doing what appears to be a mild F3-style workout. Turns out they were from Lifetime Fitness and I'm pretty confident Captain Jack EH'd a guy as we were wrapping up!

Staubach ran about three miles EC solo, and Repeato & Frisco conduct their own Rucking IR workout at the AO.

Announcements:

- May 1st F3 Beer Launch at Pharmacy
- May 31 Century Day - EH folks!
- F3 Dads is THIS Saturday at Bond Park, 9:00 all kids welcome. WWW has the Q

Prayers:

- Parker's FIL treatment for Bone Cancer
- Ausfart and Sooey continued recovery

NMS: The Murph is a fairly well-balanced workout and I felt a great way to follow long run day, such the the Maynard. Most of our workouts tend to focus on "Push" exercises and not much "Pull" exercises. This hits cardio, Push, and Pull all in one!
