46 degrees, the worst. Not cold, not hot, impossible to dress for. Yet twenty men showed up to Grace Sovereign Church this morning looking for a beatdown under these oppressive conditions.

**Warm-Up** Mosey around the parking lot and circle up for hillbillies (because we're in Apex), Sir Fazios forward, overhead seal claps, Sir Fazios backwards, copperhead squats and Good Mornings.

**The Thang** Find the car with the GG'S GRAN vanity plate and grab two bricks from the trunk, and overhead carry across the street to hill for elevens, brick-yo-bodies at the bottom, squat thrusts at the top.

Walk quickly back across the street to the other side of the church, while doing curls. Some pax needed a reminder what quickly means, so ten burpees.

Four rounds of ten wonder bras on the wall followed by twenty alternating left-right step-ups on the picnic tables.

Return the bricks to GG's Gran's trunk and mosey to the front of the church. Partner up, speed matters. Catch me if you can, one partner bear crawls around the pickle while the other partner does five burpees and runs.

On the wall for peoples chair, five count down the line. Counting was less than perfect, so BTTW with a five count down the line until YHC was done.

**Mary** Circle up at the flag for pax-led Mary including boat-canoe, LBCs, box cutters, one-legged Homer-to-Marge, and Eskimo kisses.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  20 **Name-a-rama**:  5 RESPECT, 12 meh, 3 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayer for WWW's family after his uncle passed away. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS** I was trying to lead a workout with no burpees, but Crimson wouldn't let me.

The bricks have been fun, but I'm ready to give them back to Pet Sounds.

Next time I call step-ups I gotta remember to do them non-alternating, Hot Spot style.

It's been too long since I posted at Tortoises, and too long since I led a workout there. It was great to be back.
