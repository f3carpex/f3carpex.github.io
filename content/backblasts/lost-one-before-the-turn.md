**Pre-blast:** IR friendly. QIC is nursing some foot stuff. Nothing major but trying to get to the point where I don't feel tightness first thing in the morning.

With that in mind, I scan the area - through Google Maps of course - and see there may be a nice trail leading from one of the parking lots out to Lochmere Lake. Looks like a nice short cut to cool views and some rocks.

And that, my friends, is how a plan comes together.

Driving up to the AO, with 2 1/2 minutes to spare, I make a quick drive-by to see if I can see the trial. Nope. Nada. "Perhaps it's a bit dark -- I'll see it a bit better up close."

Park the car and get out to sighs of relief from current and former site-Qs that the QIC is, in fact, here and they don't have to pick up a last minute no-show Frisco Q.

Catch up with Staubauch who is also, apparently, nursing some plantar. Except he did the EC run. How's that working out?

**Warm-up:**

in the grass in Waverly for SSH (25x), GM, Sir Fazio -> overhead claps, IW, merkins, MC.

**Thang 1:**

Mosey over to where the trail is supposed to be. Still nothing. Disappointment. If only Hi Liter and his lighthouse were here... So, no rocks and no lake.

Plan B:

Four corners escalating: 5 burpees; add 10 merkins; add 15 jump squats; add 20 star jumps

Interval runs in the parking lot.

Return to the start.

Down the escalator.

Back to the start to find ... Suck Up is MIA. Sadly he hurt himself on the EC.

Two Indigenous People's lines and back to the flag. World's worst until Suck Up is back and accounted for.

**Thang 2:**

Up to the top of Waverly. Grab a rail for Irkins, Pistol Squats, Derkins. 20-15-10. End with a surprise 20 Derkin.

Back to parking lot. A bit of time to burn. Interval run between parking lot islands with burpees at the top, merkins back at the blue line.

**Mary**:

Freddy Mercury and low-slooooow flutter followed by H2M.

Runners are back.

**COT**:

10+3+1 = 14

Announcements about fundraising for Meals in Raleigh.

Prayers for healing, marriages and COVID relief.

YHC took us out.
