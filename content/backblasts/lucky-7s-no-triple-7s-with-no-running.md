8 pax with no FNGs, brief disclaimer shared, only 1 pax actually read the pre-blast; “Ponder this question before tomorrow.. What is something you have done in the last 1 to 5 years that has changed your life to the positive? The answer cannot be F3 or praying, unless that was the catalyst.”

Since the Skipper did not bless us with his presence, we’ll mosey up to tennis court parking area:

2 Burpees at each parking line along tennis courts.

Circle up for warmup, windmills, imperial walker, Sir Fazio arm circles, good am, Hillbillies, runners stretch, pigeon.

Triple 7’s across the upper parking lot:

1\. Sedentary 7s of Dying Cockroach / Box Cutter

2\. Walk Crab across lot

3\. Sedentary 7s: Merkins / Superman pulses

4\. Walk Crab across lot

5\. Repeat for 7 trips across lot.

\*Sedentary 7’s is a completion of the exercises in 7’s format in one sitting before moving on.

2 Burpees at each parking line

Mosey to Rock pile for EGO rock. 4 rounds of curls and tricep extensions with a couple of rock changes.  

2 Burpees at each parking line along baseball field

Deep squat hold, arms straight and fully extended, while pushing arms back and shoulders to butt, 5 count down the line.  

Circle up for COT

YHC took us out

0.47 miles covered. A new record for YHC

NMS:

1\. YHC fretted over organizing a limited run Q; I wasn’t sure how to plan without running. Good planning exercise. The above was planned without knowing about the rock pile.

2\. Rock pile. These are Cary’s finest rocks, smooth with a hint of beige

3\. Frisco was like a sheep dog, trying to corral me into the center of the warmup and the COT, YHC would have none of that with this smaller intimate group.

4\. Got lost on my EC run and had to turn back. Need to scout this place out a little better.

5\. Great discussion on the pre-blasted material, RED RYDER.

6\. Good to see Shut In and Sooey at coffeeteria.  

7\. Burt was missed, we did some great back exercises.
