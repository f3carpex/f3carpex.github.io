I am forever grateful to Chinese Downhill for putting the EH on me several times before my first post at Danger Zone.  After that I have been hooked and I am always proud to talk about F3 anywhere at anytime.  My wife does a laughing eye-roll anytime I put an EH on another man.  She knows the next 20-30 minutes she will have nothing to say.  When I was a little kid I prayed so hard for a brother (I have 2 older sisters, and when my parents divorced, you could say I was raised by wolves....I mean women).  I also couldn't join a fraternity in college - I was on the golf team but we aren't the manliest of men, and it is a very small group.  In F3, God did answer my childhood prayers with the best brothers in the world and He placed me in the best fraternity - the F3Carpex Fraternity.

Over the past 2 years I have found what I was looking for...and didn't know I was looking.  I found a fraternity of solid guys who support each other in a way that is genuine, kind, thoughtful, and loving while still being masculine.  It is this level of support I didn't know I needed, and didn't know I could give.  This support is awesome and it is impressive to witness each of you picking up the six away from the workouts.  You are all doing God's work and your support for our brothers is evident.  You support each other with physical labor, charitable donations, moral support, meals, and sometimes a simple text message means the world.  Of course, we do all of these things while proudly wearing F3 T-shirts (thank you Hello Kitty).

Unfortunately there have been too many times where we needed to support our brother and couldn't/shouldn't wear our F3 t-shirts...it wasn't appropriate this time...in fact, this time we needed to wear a suit.  It was truly the worst time for our brother and the time he needed the most support from us and we were there, but something was missing.  So, I was trying to think of something to celebrate our first anniversary at FMJ, and an F3 lapel pin seemed to be the perfect party favor for our FMJ Celebration.  Life is tough and unfortunately we know we will have to put on that suit again to support a brother, but now we can support him in his biggest time of need, wear that suit, and show our F3 brotherhood.  I bought 30 lapel pins, I don't know why I chose the number 30 - we haven't had that many at FMJ before, but I did.  Wouldn't you know it, we had exactly 30 Pax for the workout today.  Coincidence?  I think not.  Another answered prayer.

**Warm Up:**

Mozy to the top parking lot

SSH x 15

Imperial Walkers x 14 (just to mess with everyone)

Good Mornings x 10 (you have to if Nature Boy is attending)

Merkins x 20 (again, you have to if Ma Bell is attending)

Calf Stretches x 10 count (Parker really "gave it to me" and GTL gave it to everyone) - be careful what you say in front of the Pax...they are all 4th graders...geez!

Mountain Climbers x 20

**Thang:**

Jog to the track for all of the Tar Heel fans (2 of us) for a little "4 corners"  We did 25 Wide Grip Merkins, 25 Jump Squats, 25 Diamond Merkins, 25 Monkey Humpers and a plank hold (with several versions while picking up the 6) at the start/finish line.

Jog over to the middle lot and partnered up for some Dora.  100 Merkins, 200 LBC's, 300 Calf Raises and picked up the 6 with pulsing squats and plank holds.

Jog to the play set where we divided the group into two's.  Group 1 ran around the baseball field while Group 2 did a Mini Murph Set (10 pull ups, 20 merkins, 30 squats).  Rotated, then repeated for 3 Mini Murph sets and then jogged back to the flag, but we had to hit the last hill on the way.

**Mary led by the Pax:**

Boat Canoe

Freddy Mercuries

Low Slow Flutter

Hello Dolly (not the same without Callahan present)

**Announcements:**

**Praises/Prayers:**

Nature boy praising F3 brothers for helping his buddy Singlet from Churham area for helping him through the flooding of his home.  The Pax came through....again

McCants closed with a powerful prayer of thanks, praise, and hope for those all around us.  God has blessed us all - we cannot forget that - and we need to bless others.

Thank you gentlemen - I am so proud of all of you!
