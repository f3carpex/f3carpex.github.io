Fresh out of Q School was feeling ready to run a clean workout. Hit the snooze a few too many times today causing site Q's Imp and Rooney begin formulating a backup plan. Thankfully traffic was light (imagine that) and YHC arrived in time to give the one minute warning. No FNGs, give a disclaimer-ish and we're off..
