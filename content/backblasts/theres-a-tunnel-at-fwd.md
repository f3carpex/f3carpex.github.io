Yes, you gotta jog up Tryon past Piney Plains and down past the fancy apartments on the left to get to it.  10 Pax circled up at 0530, we jogged up to the Veterinarian entrance for a standard Shut-In Warm-Up. Jog up Tryon Rd, do some irkins on the guard rail, jog up Tryon Road, do some LBC's at the Nationwide office, jog up Tryon Road past the fancy entrance sign at the apartments, to the greenway and back down into the emergency spillway aka/greenway tunnel.  BTTW to wait on the 6.  Recover, split into 2 groups, group 1 BTTW hold while group 2 runs back out of the tunnel up to the guard rail to do 25 more irkins, flip flop (pretty sure the guard rail isn't supposed to make that noise when you are doing irkins on it, somebody get that added to Cheddar Bo's list). Jog down greenway.  This is where the Cluster Q really started to shine.  I was asked if this was an out and back or a loop, and one of the Pax actually believed something i said and turned back in an effort to nurse his ankle or maybe go find his Uncle Ben.  The other Pax told me this and and I didn't believe them, oh wait, he really did do that.  Thanks Largemouth for going back to find him! Make a right on Cary Pkwy and run back to the Flag.

Do some more LBCs and then do some more LBCs as we run back.  Then 2 more Pax ran back up Tryon to go find the 2 pax that went missing earlier.  Then we see the first pax, but not the 2nd??? Well he went to go find us, not to mention the other 2 that are still gone.  So about 8 of the 10 do some penalty burpees for this cluster.  Then some more LBC's for good measure (I think we got 206 in cadence for 412 total LBC's, i'm pretty sure that is an all time F3 Nation record!).  The last 2 guys showed up just in time for COT.  The Pax covered a range of about 2.9 to 4 miles depending on your role in the cluster noted above.

Did you keep up with all of that?  I would need a map, a venn diagram and likely a Hotspot Power Point presentation to fully demonstrate exactly what happened.

NMS: Sorry about the Cluster Q fellas.
