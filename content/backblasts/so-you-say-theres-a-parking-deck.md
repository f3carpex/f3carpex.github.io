There's really no reason I've not been to Dazed and Confused is a few months. So when I was looking at the Q sheet early this week and noticed a gap for Friday, decided to jump in there. Almost immediately, I heard from Mama's Boy. Apparently he was watching the Q sheet as well. I figure the excitement he was expressing was almost certainly his feeble attempt at reverse psychology. Nevertheless, I'm not taking my name off now.

## Warm Up

Following the pledge and disclaimer, mosey to the other side of the school and to the small lot behind the parking deck. Circle up for SSHs, a single Good Morning led by Crimson, Moroccan Night Clubs, Steve Earles, Calf stretch and 25 merkins.

## The Thang

Mosey to the top of the parking deck. Line up on one side. We will Apple Turnover for a specified number of steps. Apple turnover is a bear crawl that flips over to a crab walk. We go for a Q specified number of steps, then mosey the rest of the way across the deck. LBCs until the 6 arrive, then the Q calls an exercise. Then we go back, and keep repeating this for escalating number of steps. Eventually we flip the apple turnover to Crawl Bear/Walk Crab. And mix in recovery mosey laps. PAX are also given the chance to pick an exercise, with our F3 Raleigh guest ManRam leading the group in King David Kicks.

When the shoulders are shot, we revert to El Capitans as our mode of transportation. Many merkins are done. With the clock ticking down, we mosey back to the flag.

## Mary

Captain Thor up to 5:20, then 25 more Merkins to reach a total of 150 Merkins for the workout.

## COT

20 total PAX, including 2 Honors and 1 Hate. Carpex Culture month is announced, prayer requests are taken and YHC takes us out.

## NMS

- Our Raleigh brothers seemed to enjoy the workout and praised the Carpex culture. We enjoyed having you!
- Good work by our site Qs Mama's Boy and Deuce to keep an eye on safety!
- Deuce was rewarded with a copy of Freed to Lead following the workout. He'll be passing that along to another PAX when he finishes it.
- Mumblechatter was very strong with this group. Dangles were discussed at length.
- Mama's Boy is still a Ladies Man.
- MIAGD!
