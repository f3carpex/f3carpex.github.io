After stressing out for a few weeks about my first Q, it‚Äôs now Monday. I ping Peeping Tom, my cousin who EH‚Äôd me one year ago, to get some feedback on my plan. Grief is delivered, something about how I‚Äôm asking him about this the day before I‚Äôm supposed to Q. I attempt to correct him, stating I'm fine, I‚Äôll have all day Tuesday to nail things down. Additional grief is exchanged about how I‚Äôve actually only got 10 hours before the Q.. yadda yadda ya...  
  
Turns out being led by you all over the last year taught me a thing or two, as things just seemed to go really smoothly. Thanks for the all the leadership and examples over the last year, and especially during my first Q - it was an honor to give back to you all¬†üëäüèº
