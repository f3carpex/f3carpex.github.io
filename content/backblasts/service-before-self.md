**10 November 2018** -- the day before Veterans Day and YHC was ready to lead a bootcamp for the ages to pay honor and tribute to our Nation's warriors who have worn the uniform to defend freedom at home and abroad.

**I knew I needed stronger men than myself to lead this epic beatdown, and so I literally called in the Troops.**

Here's how it went down, keeping in mind that the pax were well equipped with weight vests and ruck sacks, and 2 men at all times carried a log c/o of our brother Bartman (who was  out Rucking his ass off at a tough... what a beast).

[Bayonne](https://f3carpex.com/tag/bayonne/), [Biner](https://f3carpex.com/tag/biner/), [Blue Water](https://f3carpex.com/tag/blue-water/), [Crimson](https://f3carpex.com/tag/crimson/), [Disco Duck](https://f3carpex.com/tag/disco-duck/), [Earhart](https://f3carpex.com/tag/earhart/), [Flacco](https://f3carpex.com/tag/flacco/), [Flip Flop](https://f3carpex.com/tag/flip-flop/), [Heisenberg](https://f3carpex.com/tag/heisenberg/), [Hello Kitty](https://f3carpex.com/tag/hello-kitty/), [Hermès](https://f3carpex.com/tag/hermes-2/), [Macho Man](https://f3carpex.com/tag/macho-man/), [Pierogi](https://f3carpex.com/tag/pierogi/), [pivot](https://f3carpex.com/tag/pivot/), [Quiver](https://f3carpex.com/tag/quiver/), [Repeato](https://f3carpex.com/tag/repeato/), [Smokey](https://f3carpex.com/tag/smokey/), [Snots](https://f3carpex.com/tag/snots/), [Sooner](https://f3carpex.com/tag/sooner/), [Tecumseh](https://f3carpex.com/tag/tecumseh/), [Texas Ranger](https://f3carpex.com/tag/texas-ranger/), [The Joker](https://f3carpex.com/tag/the-joker/), [Theismann](https://f3carpex.com/tag/theismann/), [Traffic Cone](https://f3carpex.com/tag/traffic-cone/), [WWW](https://f3carpex.com/tag/www/)

**Warmups:** YHC gathers the men, and Smokey (US Army) takes it from there. He gets the men into formation, 4 companies deep in his command, and we move out to the Community Center lot. SSH, Standard Merkin, Mountain climber, and then back into formation to the kiosk

**Thang 1:** When YHC put out the call for Veterans to lead our pain stations, Macho Man (USMC) was first to reach out with a, "I'm a hard charging Devil Dog, what do you need?" Ah yes, he'll do just fine. Macho takes over to lead the men through a Marine inspired beatdown chalk-full of partner pulls, firemen carries, merkins in Marine Corp count and a Marine crawl. Oorah!

**Thang 2:** After Smokey re-assembled the men, we're off to the rock pile. Jack Tiger aka Crimson (US Army) introduces the pax to the Gig pit, for rock work that included American Hammers, Dying Cockroaches and up downs. He whipped 'em good.

**Thang 3:** Another company mosey to the back street (no boys only men) for the WWW's (US Air Force) special. He took us back to his time during Desert Storm and crushed the pax with the burpee version of Thunderstruck along with WWII's, more pain inbetween, and a 10-count of burpees just to top it off.

**Thang 4:** It's a company mosey back to the lot and Theismann (US Navy) steps in to all but finish the pax off with a PT test that includes amrap Merkins, and partner sit ups with a pickle all-you-got x 2.

And... as to not forget out the Coast Guard, YHC wraps up the beatdown with a boat canoe to take us out.

Announcements were announced and prayers were prayed for our pax and their offerings. YHC took us out.

**NMS:** In addition to our beatdown leaders, we also had Tecumseh and Bayonne in our ranks today, both US Navy Vets.

I could spend a lot of time in the NMS, but I feel like I'd ramble and carry on. I'll say this. I (like many if not all of you) have a deep sense of pride in my country and incredible gratitude to those who have worn our nation's uniform. When there are many things we should say to the American warrior, there is always one thing we will... THANK YOU!
