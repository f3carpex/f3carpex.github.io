24 total PAX. Pineapple and Chops were not there, even though they clicked the HC button. I assume they know what HC stands for.  
Half was there. I assume Burt told him he should go.  
Lookout ran a bunch of miles so we would quit asking him how he felt and was there for COT.  
It was a glorious 57 degrees on the Trusty Tundra Thermometer. Spectacular relief from the recent sweatfests.  
2 did an EC EC run of about 3 miles, a bunch more did the regular 3 mile EC run including Half.

\- I sure am thankful for the leadership of Joe Smith and Oofda as founders of this premier AO. Just think, yall would've had to drive to North Cary Park or some other unmentionable peakish city to go to a workout this morning if it wasnt for them!  
\- Thank you to Blue Water and Francois for their awesome Site Qership and taking this site to the next level!  
\- Thank you all my of F3 brothers for making me stronger spiritually, relationally, emotionally and physically!  
\- You should've had about 550 LBCs if you did it right. A good Q is always remembered the next morning...
