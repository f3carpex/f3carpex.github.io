Big crowd this morning, fortunately there were more bells than pax. Two or three pax with an EC run, plus Kwik Stop for EC tire flippin'.

**Warm-Up** Lap around the parking lot and circle up for imperial walkers, Sir Fazios, copperhead merkins and squats, control freak good mornings.

**The Thang** Tabata, 20 seconds of work, 10 seconds of rest, four rounds, four sets, four exercises, with a lap between each round. Round 1 - KB press, KB squat, standard merkin, KB LBC Round 2 - KB curl, KB squat-thrust, dry docks, KB Freddie Mercs Round 3 - KB rows, monkey humpers, KB bench press, KB Homer-to-Marge Round 4 - KB curl, KB squat, KB press, burpee

**Mary** Have a Nice Day.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  20 **Name-a-rama**:  2 RESPECT, 15 meh, 3 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for Bolton's Uncle Eric, in the hospital with kidney problems. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**  FNG Andrew showed up in a Notre Dame shirt, someone said "Hunchback," Andrew said "Not Hunchback," YHC said "Welcome FNG Hunchback"

Check my math, did we really only have two Respects this morning? Special thanks to Earhart for not letting me be the only one.

More special thanks to Wahoo for providing the parking lot coffee.

This workout was mostly borrowed from the thorough beating Prodigal dropped on us at Ragnarok last week. I plugged "tabata" into google translate, it's Portuguese for "Embrace The Suck!"

Love you guys!
