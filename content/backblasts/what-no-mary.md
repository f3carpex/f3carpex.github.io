It was the spring morning we missed in sprint at flirting with disaster with 18 paxs.

![](images/images.jpg)

The exercise started off with a lite run to the park for some warm ups.

Side saddle hops

Merkins

Calf Stretches

Runner strectches

Imperial walkers

Then we did a run toward the bridge stopping at the intersection to some quick LBCs

At the bridge Ollie really wanted to bear crawl across the bridge so we did our best. The we did 7's on the hills with pull ups on the bridge and then Merkins at the bottom.

Since we had an FNG @Wild Beaver we wanted to show him the park on the other side of bridge so a quick run there were we did partner run/exercise with 100 left/right step-ups and 100 dips.

After that we did a run back to bridge and then lunge walk across bridge for the fresh early morning smells of C02. Then back to the flag with no time left for mary's. So we did a quick naming of Wild Beaver.

Then announcements and Chipper lead us out with a prayer.

Prayer requests:

Macho man - requested we pray from a teenager have suicide thoughts that he is helping with.

Chipper - reminded us to keep the Virginia Beach folks in our prayers and thoughts

Greenbow - Asked for prayers for his job as he was recently laid off

Of course the Q could not get his phone to record so he is missing a few Pax's...
