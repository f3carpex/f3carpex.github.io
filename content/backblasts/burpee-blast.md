Preamble

The title of this backblast has a double entendre given that, yes, we did a lot of burpees, but also because we had a blast doing them. The morning started swimmingly with a nice (but sadly, solo) EC run on the back streets of DTC, dodging downed branches and fencing. Back at the posted start and after a wipedown on McCants' freshly laundered shirt, 6 gathered for what would be a smallish workout. Perfect! Hey, there's a new guy - another Chad. Oh, here comes Callahan sort of on-time. YHC dutifully spouted the 5 core principles and cited the F3 mission statement to our FNG. One look at him and I could tell he didn't need a disclaimer.

Warmup and Main Thang

We started with the pledge before taking off toward the Arts Center. Wait, there's Snots. Not sure if he got out of an Uber or what but he joined in and off we went around the side of the Arts Center for the warmup consisting of penalty burpees, Good Mornings, Merkins (of course), Steve Earls, Sir Fazio Arm Cirles, and O/H Claps. We ran back to the corner of Dry and Academy where we proceeded with Paula Abduls. This version consisted of running 3 light poles forward (where we did 3 triple-merkin burpees) and 2 light poles back (where we did 2 double-merkin burpees). We kept doing that almost all the way to the corner of Chatham. This group of athletic heroes had stopped to stand up a fence that had blown over in the previous night's storm. You know, just male community leadership and such. Really, they didn't want to do any more burpees but I allowed the heroic interlude.

Off we went to the bank where we did a round of single-leg step-ups, Irkins, Derkins, and Dips before proceeding on up Academy to Town Hall for a round of BLIMPS around said town hall, stopping at various points. With 5 min left, we Indian Ran back to the flag for the final set of 30 squats (plus a bonus round of 5 burpees). FNG (now Canary) was a beast; he'll fit right in.

NMS

I asked a German friend of mine if he knew the square root of 81. He said no.

A horse walked into a bar. The bartender said Hey, what'll you have. The horse said "yes, please."

Some douche canoe ran by us while we were doing our Paula Abduls yelling insults at us. Couldn't tell if he was joking or not. If not; you mad, bro?

FNG Chad is from West Virginia and went to WVU. Being from coal country (not really; he's from Charleston) was Canary. Fun fact: _Canary in a Coalmine_ is also a song by The Police. Welcome Canary!

BOM

After Name-a-rama, announcements, and such. YHC took us out in prayer.

Thanks gentlemen! It is always a pleasure to lead such a group of HIM. MIAGD and Go Pack!
