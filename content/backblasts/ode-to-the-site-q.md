After all the ECs came to a conclusion and the dust cloud of PAX settled in, the disclaimer was given, and we we're off into the few minutes of gloom we had left...

FNG Check... welcome Kevin! Let's do this.

Mosey halfway to the power lines and circle up in the gravel for  
SSH // IW // SFAC // rSFAC // OC // SC // Merkins

Continue through the park stopping in the second parking area for copperhead good mornings. Hope you enjoyed them.

THANG 1 - PARTNER UP  
Dora featuring 200 each of Prisoner Squats // Calf Raises // Sumo Squats

after a cluster Q moment and a jaunt down the surprisingly well lit trail back to the bottom of the hill

THANG 2 - FIVES with burpees at the top and burpees at the bottom

Mosey back to the mary lot for three rounds of an ode to the outgoing site Q:

QUACKs complete, do some LBCs, and HAND. THAT'S IT!

Goofed so hard to only meet one of the FNGs before the workout. My bad Osprey!  
  
SO MANY PEOPLE out for SO MANY ECs this morning! Run and a Ruck, then a Run or a Walk. Diversity of opportunity.  
  
This was the first time that I forgot until the night before that I had signed up for a Q. Many thanks to Disco Duck in his final evening as Site Q for broadcasting the reminder. \[Not a\] professional till the end.  
  
I had a BLAST this morning, y'all, thank you for pushing me beyond my perceived limits.
