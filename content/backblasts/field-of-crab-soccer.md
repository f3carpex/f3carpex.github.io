YHC sets out for Q 2-of-10, and it's to FOD we go.

Upon arrival, take a solo trip to the field to drop off some stuff.

Pax arrive, we've got a visitor from New York, Green Card, and he brought an FNG, ta boot. Disclaimers delivered and YHC properly heckled by Franklin and we're off.

**Warmup:**

- Over to the other lot for high knees and a butt-kickers lap
- Good morning, SSH, Mnt Climbers, Merkins, Sir Fazio (both ways), 10 burpees for Disco

**Thang 1:**

- On to the field for 4 corners.
- With 2 weight vests in-toe, 2 pax must always be wearing a vest and running a lap (cycling through the pax). The rest of the pax are taking a trip for 4 corners of:
    - 25 Merkin and 25 Squats
    - 25 WG Merkin and 25 WWII
    - 25 LBC and 25 Lunges
    - 25 CDD and 25 Freddy Mercs
    - Flip it and reverse it for a second round
- 1 Big Lap as a group around the field and over to the side goal where we find a pair of 25 lb plates (50 lbs total) tied to a rope
- 1 Pax must pull the weights while a pair of pax escort him down the field and back in vests. The rest of the pax are making a tunnel for a series of planks and other pax led exercises. Enough for everyone to get a rotation through the weight or vests.

**Thang 2:**

- We have enough time and as fate would have it, there are 2 small goals and a soccer ball on the field. Split the Pax into teams of 10 (yes, shirts and skins) for a round of crab soccer and bear crawl hand ball.
- EPIC goal tending and we end in a 0-0 tie.

**Mary:**

- Enough time for a few exercises ending in have a nice day.
- Yes, Hi-Liter, you're allowed to leave a few minutes on the back end for COT and fellowship.

**COT: 21, welcome FNG Five Hole**

- Announcements and prayers including Water Wings pending 2.something (they haveÂ  few, I think 2.4) and safe travels for our brother from NY on his journey.

**NMS:** Such a great group of HIM out at FOD. Had an awesome time with you guys. Yes, even you, Franklin. Next up: RH, Insomnia, SNS, So Wake, BO, SWW, Arena, The Crick. SYITGs.
