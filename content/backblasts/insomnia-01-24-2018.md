Well, I guess if we're going to make this official, we'll need to start posting backblasts, eh?

4 PAX gathered to send off the thoroughbreds embarking on the Maynard (but really, chasing down Hermes) while listening to Metallica courtesy of race director Shut In. Nice.

**Warm up:**

Stretch yoself

**The Thang:**

Right on Hihg House, Left on Maynard, touch the post at James Jackson and turn around, Right on High House, Left on Maury O'Dell into the parking lot.

**Pre-COT:**

Oh no...I wrote a NMS and COT and all that stuff...and somehow deleted it! Daggonit! Oh well.

 

 

See you in the gloom,

Callahan
