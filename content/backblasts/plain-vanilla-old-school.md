Today is the day before the Odyssey. Poor planning had me in the Q spot. However, location was fantastic. Old school Danger Zone.

Lots of work tomorrow so goal today was get the sweat on. Work hard but nothing that would put us out of commission for tomorrow.

Old school style, old school crowd of 8. Glorious morning. Timekeeper Saban - 545 and we were off.

1.5 laps around the pickle - warm up. GM, Abe Vigoda, IM and HB (i had a brain fart about what these two exercises were called- dont worry - the pax were gentle (or not). then a round of arm circles, forward backward, seal claps and oh claps. Then we were off for another 1/2 lap.

Oh look here - under this lamp - a deck of cards. We shall begin. Circle up - first guy pull a card, etc. etc. Number is how many, Suit is what we do. Aces trump and require a run around the pickle.

Hearts - merkins - as they warm our former nantans heart.

Clubs - star jumps

Diamonds - LBCs

Spades - Squats.

we worked through 52 cards and had a few minutes left so over to the bball court for

Irkins, peoples chair, suicide, peoples chair

Mary - Freddy mercury, H2M, Hello Dolly and WW2s

Ended promptly at 545 - trying to make Saban proud

Announcements - Odyssey, Cookout

Prayers - Nature Boy's Eldest who has a new knee injury
