**Warm-Up**

Mosey around the pickle and circle up for side straddle hops, imperial walkers, cotton pickers and Sir Fazio.

**The Thang**

Mosey over to the bleachers next to the track and partner up for Dora 1-2-3.  100 derkins, 200 dips and 300 squats while your partner runs to the fence and back, then flap jack.

Mosey over to the stairs for Jacob's ladder with star jumps at the top (in honor of the absent Site Q Goose).

Mosey over to the basketball court, line up on the sideline, bear crawl across, plank hold until all arrive, then ten copperhead merkins IC (slowly move down on the first three counts, then quickly move up on the fourth).  Bear crawl back across, squat hold until all arrive, then ten copperhead squat jumps IC.  Second round replace bear crawl with lunge walk, third round return to bear crawl.

**Mary**

Circle up and go around the horn.

Flying Circus is a fantastic AO and well worth the drive.  As someone told me afterwards we spend all our time in the darkest parts.  I'm looking forward to returning in 2018 and leading the PAX into the light.

It's an honor to lead this group of HIM.
