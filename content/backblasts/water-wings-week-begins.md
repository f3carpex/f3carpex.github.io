YHC couldn't have asked for a more glorious morning to Water Wings Week than what God blessed us with this morning. Water falling from the sky pretty much the whole morning to keep the sweat at bay.

We moseyed to the usual warm-up parking lot for some SSH, Merkins, Calf stretches and Good Mornings. Next, Mosey to the far parking lot to find a rock. We setup in the parking circle for the thang.

Its been 2 years since starting F3. Thank you Grease Monkey and Earhart (the original from Charlotte ;) for introducing me to this amazing group of HIMs. I'd put the men of Carpex up against any other group out there. Thanks for challenging each other to be better everyday.  Let's make it a great week!
