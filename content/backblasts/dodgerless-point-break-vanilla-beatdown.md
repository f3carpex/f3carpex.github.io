16 Pax showed up on a unseasonably warm October morning including about 5 of the standard EC runners. Started with the pledge and circled up. Was prepared to start off with 15 burpees if there were any Dodger fans in the house but no one took the bait. Did the usual Warmarama instead with SSH, Good Mornings, Tappy Toes, Box Cutters, Homer to Marge, Runners Stretch and Squat Holds.

Mosey to the Main Pavilion doing butt kickers, high knees and Karaoke on the way

**Thang 1**

11s (Diamond Merkins and CDDs)

Grease Monkey set the pace and finished in just over 10 minutes

**Thang 2**

Partner up

Partner 1 run up stairs and past Shake Shack and back down stairs

Partner 2 starts the exercises

Plank Hold/Leg Raise/BTW/Peoples Chair

This is where Staubach started to offer up alternatives to modify whine a little. Holding BTW for 2+ minutes was a bit challenging but Grease Monkey and Pierogi pushed us through the pain.

Repeato for 2nd round minus the BTW.

**Thang 3**

Derkins

Pax lined up around islands and with feet on wall while each Pax did 10 reps in order.
