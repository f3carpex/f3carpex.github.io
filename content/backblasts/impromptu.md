I drive into Tortoises because Freebird, my running partner is in West Virginia and Ohio this week on a much-needed vacation.  By driving in I was able to post a shovel flag for the morning event.  I had not planned to Q this morning but saw Disco Duck sign-up last minute so I offered to co-Q.  6 PAX gather in the gloom including Crimson, who drove in by himself.  Who knew he had a car?   Q starts by getting the guys to grab some curb and do a round of quick feet, a good way to warm up before the warm up.  We head out running slowly around the corner for:

## Warm Up

10 Good Mornings

15 Side Straddle Hops

10 Cotton Pickers

15 Hillbillies

 

## The Thang

Finish warmup and head over to the baby hill for 11’s, 10 burpees at the bottom and 1 squat at the top.  Repeato until we finish at the top with 10 squats and a plank hold.  About half-way through the 11s a car pulls into the parking lot and out hops Sosa, a new guy that just started posting last week.  Luckily for the PAX we were already doing burpees so no penalty for a late showing.

Finish up our planks and head over to the railing for some merkin ladder work, a set of erkins, Australian, and baby derkins with a lap up to a count of 7.

Mosey on down to the lower parking lot and grab some cinder blocks (thanks Texas!) and circle up for a progressive arm workouts of curls, presses, extensions and rock rows.  3 rounds with a lap in between each round led by WWW.

Finish up, put the blocks back and head to the picnic table for two rounds of dips and left-right step ups.  Head to the flag and circle up on sixes for:

## Mary

Q asks for a round of Mary from the PAX which included homer-to-marge, LBCs, pickle pounders, box-cutters, heel raises, and hammers.  Clock strikes 6:15 and we are done

## COT

 

**Count-a-rama:**  7 PAX.
