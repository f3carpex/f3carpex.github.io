Gotta be honest, YHC was a little nervous headed into this morning's workout. I've Q'ed a million times, but this was my first hour long solo Q. Could I handle the extra fifteen minutes? Let's find out.

**Warm-Up**

Face the Flag for the Pledge, then take a lap around the parking lot before circling up for imperial walkers, Sir Fazios, cotton pickers and burpees.

**The Thang**

Mosey out to the park entrance and travel along High House Road to the other entrance, stopping at each light pole for ten merkins, then continue down Bond Park Drive to the Lazy Days Playground, stopping at every other light pole for ten squats.

At the playground count off into groups of four, each group takes a turn doing ten pull-ups while the other groups rotate through ten carolina dry docks, ten monkey humpers and ten box cutters. So much fun let's do it again.

Mosey the long way around the boat house parking lot to the kiosk at the bottom of our favorite hill. Sevens on the hill with double American hammers at the top and double dips at the bottom, followed by a second round of sevens on the hill with dying cock-a-roaches at the top and derkins at the bottom.

Mosey back up the hill one more time to the community center parking lot and circle up for five burpees OYO. Mosey to the other side of the parking lot and circle up for five burpees OYO. Mosey around to the senior center parking lot near the park entrance and circle up for five burpees OYO. Finish up with a Billy run to the flag.

**Mary**

Circle up at the flag for low slow flutters, Freddie Mercury, Homer-to-Marge and Have A Nice Day.

**COT**

**Count-a-rama**:  21 **Name-a-rama**:  9 RESPECTs, 12 meh, 0 HATEs **Prayers / Praises**:  Thanks for the beautiful day and for the amazing brotherhood, prayers for loved ones travelling, prayers for loved ones no longer with us, prayers for loved ones going through trials **BOM**:  YHC took us out, with a big assist from Hi-Liter

**NMS**

Most Bond Park workouts begin with the PAX leaving the parking lot from the same spot and heading in the same direction. YHC wanted to shake things up a little. If we did only one thing today, we were going to leave the parking lot on the other side, headed in the other direction.

Sooey shared the story of an alcohol fueled push-up contest he had last night. Some Other Guy did 65, and our boy Sooey did a hundred. A HUNDRED! Then Other Guy knocked out ten more, so our boy Sooey threw down another twenty. Way to represent Carpex, Sooey. After hearing that story I knew he wouldn't want to do more merkins today. If we did only one thing today, we were going to do a bunch of merkins.

The pull-up bars all over Apex (thanks again, Notorious) have inspired many of the PAX to do EC pull-ups before the regular workouts. I wanted to keep that momentum going, but there's no real pull-up bars in Bond Park, so the monkey bars at the playground would have to do. If we did only one thing today, we were going to do some pull-ups.

YHC loves the hill next to the kiosk. I live next to Bond Park, and I ran up and down that hill a million times before I even joined F3. If we did only one thing today, we were going to run up and down that hill.

YHC likes to hand out burpees as punishment for misbehaving PAX, but on this beautiful day everyone was on their best behavior. So we did burpess just because. If we did only one thing today, we were going to do some burpees.

The hardest part of Q'ing is coming up with the title for the backblast. Once I decided to return to the flag from the opposite side of the parking lot, the title was born. If we did only one thing today, we were going to do a Billy run the back way.

Strong work by Frisco on those ten counts, they just got better each time he did it.

Welcome FNGs Bad Bad and Carman.

Baconator stuck around after the workout to talk to the PAX about nutrition, and Flacco was nice enough to provide coffee. That's two HIM right there.

Special thanks to Hi-Liter for the prayers for me and my family. The support, prayers, encouragement, friendship, everything you men have done for us has been special and is appreciated. It was an honor to lead this group of High Impact Men today.
