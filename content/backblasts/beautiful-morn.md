Amazingly fresh & a bit brisk this morning at FMJ! Nice size group of 11 -- we got to know each other a bit better, got some sweat going, & had some fun! Here's what happened in brief:

Warm-up \-- on the mosey around the soccer field/pond we made several stops along the way for good mornings, windmills, calf stretch merkins, burpees, SSH, hill billies, imperial walkers, etc.

Thang 1: Aussie pull-ups on the even numbers 20 on down. Alternate dips in the playground and LBCs at the flag.

Thang 2: Mosey to the elementary school for some much requested side plank star crunches followed by ring of fire variety of merkins.

Thang 3: Partner one runs to hill for bear crawls up while partner two does the agility pickle. Flip flop & repeato. Do it one more time with crab crawl up the hill - flip flop.

On way back to the flag, stop along the curb for merkins along the curb -- left arm up, then right. Time for a bit more mary -- DC's, H-T-M, then a glorious HAND.
