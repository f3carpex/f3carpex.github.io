13 HIM (FNG Mitchell) got their week started right at Kryptonite this am.  40 degrees.  Clear.  No wind.

Here is what we did:

Warm up

- Circle up for SSH while we wait on Flouride
- Run to the large parking lot.
- Line up for SSH, a miscalled Good Morning, IW etc with a few sprints between light poles (~ 50 yards) included.

Thangs - All in the Parking Lot

- Set of 22's - Hand Release Merkins and Jump Squats.  Between the poles.
- Jacobs Ladder Up to 6 - Man Makers.  Between the poles.
- 2 Line Indian Run - Back Pax does 3 Burbees, then runs to the front - Set sets of Burbees as we circled the big lot
- Set of 11's - Merkins and Jump Knee Tucks.  Between the poles.
- Mary between the poles.   Mary exercise then run to light pole (about 50 yards) and then another Mary.   Low Fast Flutters, LBC's, Rosalita, American Hammers, Fred Mercs.
- Run back to the lot.
- One final Mary.   Dying Cockroach called by Earheart

COT

- Welcome Mitchell.   Just know last year he was called Mitch.
- Needed our other pole (Pierogi as there) this am.
- Praises for Denali's 10 year Wedding Anniversery
- My Twin, Chanticleer, took us out.
- BTW:  Chanty was a beast this am.   A man among boys.

Always a highlight of my day to lead y'all.   Later.   Make it a great day.
