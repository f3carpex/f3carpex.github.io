YHC rolled into the grounds of Flying Circus, arguably the finest AO in west Cary on a Thursday, to see a couple of HIMs already on the grounds. A few pull-ups are done at the baseball field, and eventually there's a solid dozen ready for a good sweat-fest. Disclaimer is disclaimed, Allegiance is pledged, watches are started, and we're off.

### Warm Up

Mosey around the parking lot and circle up for Good Mornings, Steve Earles, Moroccan Night Clubs, Seal Claps, and Control Freak Merkins.

### The Thang

Mosey to the track for the Sheldon Cooper:

- Run 1 lap
- Complete 10 Burpees, 10 Merkins, 10 Squats, and 10 Big Boy Situps
- Run 1 lap
- Complete 9/9/9/9
- Continue until you've counted all the way down to 1s

### Mary

Dying Cockroaches x 30, LBCs x 20, Have a Nice Day

### COT

4 Respects, 2 Hates, 6 Mehs. There were announcements, prayer requests for Liverpool's family, PBX's family, YHC's family, and Geek Squad traveling next week. YHC took us out in prayer.

### NMS

- Not many good places to do pull-ups at this site. Improvisation may be necessary.
- 3.33 miles covered in the main event. YHC is claiming the mileage record at the Circus.
- The PAX were all a sweaty mess by the time the clock ran out, but it was FUN.
- Did I say it was FUN?
- This is one routine where it is truly YOU vs. YOU. Well done guys!
- Make an effort to help at least one person today, and be a little better than you were yesterday.
