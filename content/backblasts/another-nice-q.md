**AO:** Back In Black  
**Workout Date:** 07/01/21  
My sixty-ninth Q of the year was the prior Friday at Boiler Room, but that won't stop me from repeating the joke for my sixty-ninth challenge Q today. Nice.  
  
BIB starts surprisingly early (0515), and YHC pulled into the Koka Booth lot just in time to catch Cauliflower and Adjacent for the prerun. I laced up and we were off on a two mile loop where we saw lots of wildlife (rabbits, a bat, maybe a mouse?) and I was able to quiz Cauliflower about the AO. I verified BIB was a standard boot camp workout and Cauliflower's main piece of advice was to finish by 6:03am so the PAX could make it to New York Bagel Deli in the timely manor to which they were accustomed. Noted.  
  
Having posted Kryptonite in the same location a few weeks ago, I was well aware of the huge parking lot next door and figured that would be a good place to at least start. We spent the whole time there.

**Warm Up:**  
State the mission, check for FNGs (0), and give the disclaimer  
Pledge of Allegiance  
Side Straddle Hop x10 In Cadence (IC)  
Good Morning x5 IC  
Imperial Walker x10 IC  
Sir Fazio Arm Circles forward x5 IC, reverse x5 IC

**Main Event**  
**1)** Mosey to the big parking lot next door for **Number of the Beast**: 6 stations, 6 rounds, 6 exercises (one per round), 6 reps per station. There weren't six street lights in a row, so we did three in a row and then came back to start. So our starting point became station six. The exercises were Squats, Little Baby Crunches, Merkins, Jump Squats, American Hammers, and Burpees.  
**2)** Stay local for **Dora 1-2-3**. I was concerned the standard Dora exercises would be repetitive, so we mixed it up with 100 four-count plank jacks, 200 four-count Freddy Mercurys, and 300 jump squats (crowd-sourced from Hermes). The four-counts dragged it out a bit, and it was time to head back to the flag for Mary.
