Great morning with a high impact crew at Phoenix this fine Carpex Saturday.   We covered quite a bit of the park & had some good times!  

EC runners were cruising around (sorry Texas Ranger had to scoot out) & I got to chat on the move with our newly acquired PAX from Churham – Flenderson.  We all hope this trade plays out well over time & we won’t miss the cow & two goats we gave up for him.

6:30 rolled in, a scan for FNGs only revealed familiar faces, disclosure was delivered & we started off…. In a quick loop, then back to the flag for our Pledge. 

The Warm Up

Mosey down to lower lot where we painted the lines & circled up for a warm up.  SSH, Good Mornings, Windmills, Merkins, Calf stretch merkins, side plank star crunches, & mountain climbers were done.

Thang 1

Mosey to far baseball field & partner up – everyone gets a rock, P1 gets hero rock & P2 gets traveler.  (this proved to be quite difficult for some – like little kids looking for the perfect Christmas Tree).  P1 runs back to the bridge for 3 burpees & returns to switcheroo.  P2 exercises with hero rock AMRAP, then trades down to lighter rock AMRAP.  First round – goblet squarts, repeato with presses & curls, repeato with rows & rock-your-bodies.  Roughly two Indian Run lines back up the road – stopping every 4 lightpoles for burpees, WWIIs, or scorpion CDDs.

Thang 2

In the shelter, 3 rounds of benchwork:  step up/downs, derkins, & dips.  Mosey the path to the amphitheater for:

Thang 3

Starting in the back row, snake-line each row of seats:  bear crawl one way & mosey backwards the next working our way down to the stage – good times! 

Mosey to the Kiosk for some Mary – Dying Cockroaches, Merkins, WWII’s.  Felt like we were running short on time, so kicked into high gear with an “all you got” up the hill, mosey to the turn, then another “all you got” to the flag.  What??  Still have 10 minutes, how’d that happen?  Extended Mary with a fun agility-mosey enjoyed most by Flip Flop around our new shipping containers in the parking lot.  More Mary including WWII’s, Freddy Mercs, Homer-to-Marge, & 100’s, then finally, Have a Nice Day.

    - Seems like we have many PAX with struggles we are lifting up – as Hi-Liter pointed out, if we all do a little we can bring much needed help.  In our prayers plus lots of others across the PAX:
        - Swag & his family as they support & fight alongside of his M
        - Crimson & his family as they support his FIL in his final days
        - Sooey – continued recovery from back surgery

Fantastic F3 representation this morning, I’m honored to be part of it.
