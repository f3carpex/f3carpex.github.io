YHC took on his VQ on his birthday. This workout has been loosely floating around in YHC's mind for some time, and could not find a better time to drop it on the PAX. YHC put his name on the Q sheet a couple of weeks ago and had plenty of time to study the Exicon and pull the weirdest, most off the wall exercises to fit the theme of reflection. Huge shout out to Jigglypuff for picking up my 6 in my VQ.

Circle the PAX in a circle. Disclaim the disclaimer, FNG check with 2. Great!

Warm up - Chinook Arm Circles in cadence. Tippy Taps, Good mornings

Thang 1:

Went for a short Mosey to the lower field. YHC is not a runner, so we kept the runs pretty short. YHC had some cones set, roughly 43 feet or so apart, Partnered up the PAX and started with some de-constucted manmakers. Bear crawl from line to line, 20 Bobby Hurleys between partners, bear craw back. Crab walk line to line, 20 mountain climbers between partners, crab walk back, Partner wheelbarrow walks line to line, 20 plank jacks between partners, switch partners for the wheelbarrow walk back. Partner carry down, 10 manmakers between partners, switch partners for the carry back.

Thang 2:

Started as Crab vs Bear soccer, with goalies planking. Started off well, a bit of MC from the PAX, then turned to shirts vs skins bear soccer, to just a weird, ridiculous handball thing. MC was strong. Tecumsah and FNG Cheesesteak could go pro. Heinz 57 and FNG 7 mile stood tall in the goals. Several ringers amongst the group.

Mary:

American Hammers in Cadence

Elbows-2-Knees in Cadence - each side.

COT- YHC explained the symbolism of the workout. All the little stuff that makes us MEN, can be broken down and shared with our brothers. Even to the point of carrying you or your brother. When everything gets ridiculous, you just have to have fun with it all.
