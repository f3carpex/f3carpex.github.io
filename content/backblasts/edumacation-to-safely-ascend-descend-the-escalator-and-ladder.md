It was meant to be. Triple Lindy had the original Q but due to his M’s work schedule change, he had to pull himself out. I saw the opening and jumped right in or Slappy or Cataracts would had to cover. I was honored to take the slot. This helps my quest to Q a minimum of 52 times for 2020.

F3-ministravia done: Mission, Core Values and Credo. Pledged to Old Glory.

Mosey to Publix parking lot to warm-up. No coupons waiting on the PAX.

Warm-up: GM, Abe Vigoda, hamstring stretch, Sir Fazio, overhead claps, calf stretches.
