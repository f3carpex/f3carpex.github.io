I got the idea of writing this BB about four weeks prior to the Tobacco Road Marathon. I was on a long run on the ATT and I was thinking about my training, and how different it had been from previous races. It became perfectly clear that it was F3 that helped me change up what I thought was working for me. But it was far more than just a change to my running schedule.

Since I started running and triathlon training back in 2002 I never really ran more than 3 days a week. Partly because I needed other days for other things like biking, swimming and resistance training, but I believed 3 intentional runs (easy/recovery, speed/interval and a long run) were enough. And for the most part that worked. I was able to consistently improve my time over 7 marathons and 3 Ironmans. And the whole time I kept telling myself (and anyone else that listened) that’s all I needed.

It also didn’t help me that during the majority of that time living in Lumberton I was often the person other people came to for advice. I was one of only a few people who did events like this, and was very much a big fish in a small pond.

Fast forward 15 years and I find myself in Wake County and introduced to F3. As some of you know, there was a 6 week period between my family leaving Lumberton and being able to move into our new house in Apex. We were lucky enough to live with dear friends in Holly Springs and I posted for the first time at Thunder in South Wake, hence the F3 name Squatter. I was EH’d by Midget For Life and my friend Randall (Jar Jar) posted for his first time as well.

At that time my personal schedule, and to some degree my stubbornness, only allowed me to post Wednesday nights. But I also ran on Thursday nights with the Holly Springs Run Club. That's when I met Lucky Charms. For those that don’t know him, his resume is extremely impressive and includes pretty much every major marathon and triathlon. He led the runs on Thursday nights and they were punishing. 

During this 6 weeks I quickly realized that I went from being one of the “best” runners/triathletes in all of Lumberton, to not even being the one of the best on a Wednesday or Thursday night. It was humbling but motivating.

I was already registered to run the Wrightsville Beach Marathon, which would have been my 2nd attempt at qualifying for Boston. My first attempt was four years earlier at  Myrtle Beach. I was 43 and needed 3:15 to qualify. I finished in a heartbreaking 3:15:16.

The Wrightsville race was in March 2018 and it was still late September/early October 2017. And although we finally moved into our house in Apex and I started posting with Carpex, I still only ran 3 days a week. Worse, I didn’t post on those running days, which means I was only posting 2-3 times a week. So I wasn’t getting to know the PAX, I wasn’t really getting in enough workouts, and I was not running with the HIM who would eventually make me a better runner.

For Wrightsville, at age 47, my new Boston qualifying time was 3:25. I finished in 3:26:17.

After that marathon I didn’t have any other races on my calendar so I started to post a lot more. I was working out 5-6 times a week, starting to hit the high intensity AOs like Kryptonite, running Insomnia and Vesper, joining in on a few EC runs and enjoying The Maynard.

Later that year I was EH’d by Denali to join his BRR team along with Largemouth, Chanticleer and five F3 Raleigh brothers. It was at this point that every day became BRR training and included an EC run before almost every workout. And although he was on another BRR team, joining us for every run was Michelob.

Each run I found myself staring at their backs trying to keep up. Things like that are always tough on the ego but I knew chasing them was helping me become a stronger runner, both physically and mentally.

After the BRR, the five of us decided to put together a 6 man team for next year and I was already signed up for the 2019 Tobacco Road Marathon, so “training” never really stopped. We continued our daily EC runs, the Maynard became an almost weekly thing and longer runs started happening on Saturdays.

It’s important for me to say that although I have spent a lot of time running with Michelob, Denali, Largemouth and Chanticleer they are not the only F3 Brothers I’ve run with and who have helped me grow in so many ways. I have logged plenty of miles with plenty of other PAX from South Wake to Raleigh. It would be a shame for me to try to name them all and leave someone out. Please know I am thankful to all of you.

More than that, from the time I whole-heartedly started to embrace everything F3 had to offer me, I can’t put into words the difference it has made in my life. It has made me a better person, and again it would not be possible to single out a few brothers who had a part in that. All the PAX in this region I’ve met, but especially my brothers here in Carpex have brought something out in me I didn’t even know I was missing. Whether  it’s a 1st, 2nd or 3rd F or whether we’ve spent 45 minutes, hours, days or weeks together, I am learning so much from you men, and I want to sincerely thank you.

Going into the Tobacco Road Marathon I knew my training was spot on. I also felt that I was mentally stronger. But more than that, I knew I had the support of my F3 Brothers and I did not want to let them down. 

I also had a secret weapon. In every previous marathon I’ve run, I’ve run alone. And even if you’re feeling strong once doubt creeps into your mind, and there’s no one there to help you fight it off, it will affect your results. However, I talked Michelob into running with me, so I was confident this was going to be the year.

The Boston qualifying times were rolled back 5 minutes this year, so I had to run in under 3:20. That’s a 7:38 pace, but to play it safe we were going to try to keep it between 7:30-7:35.

Having Michelob running with me, and knowing how many Carpex brothers were also there running the half marathon and supporting us was going to be helpful, but then Old Maid and Largemouth stepped it up a notch. Old Maid jumped in with us at about mile 4 and ran the next 9 miles with us. Largemouth jumped in at mile 19 and took us home.

But it’s not so much what they did as how they did it, that was most helpful. 

Throughout the years I have been on both sides of the scenario when you’re running with someone who may be struggling, so you keep pace with them, you tell them they can do it, and you stay with them as they slow down, walk or even quit. It happens, and I understand that sometimes that’s what’s needed in that moment. However this was not one of those moments, and that is not what I needed.

From the first step to the last, whenever I was struggling and I relied on one of these 3 HIM to help, they didn’t slow down to meet my pace and tell me I was doing good, they told me I got this and challenged me to meet their pace. And like most of my training runs, I spent the race staring at their backs, and trying to catch them.

Miles 18 - 21 were tough for me, but Michelob and Largemouth just kept running our pace. They ran and talked like any other run, and I just stared at their backs and didn’t let them get too far ahead of me. At about mile 21 when Large said that all we had left was a “Vesper” run I knew I had it.

Coming into the finish, as to be expected, F3 was in full force cheering us on. M4L and Jar Jar were there, a few other South Wake guys and a whole mess of Carpex brothers. Plus my M and 2.0, who knew more than anyone how bad I needed this. Parker ran and pushed us through the home stretch and Michelob and I crossed the finish line in 3:16:24. Both of us qualifying for Boston.

It’s times like this I wish I was more poetic or a better writer so I can fully express the gratitude I feel toward all the people who helped me in the last 18 months. When I moved here, I was truly a sad clown. And recently, because of my work situation, I’ve been struggling again. But each time I find that even when you don’t give F3 your all, F3 gives you so much more in return.

Thank You.
