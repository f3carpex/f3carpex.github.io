The PAX recruiting game showed up strong on this A.M. as we had 3 FNGs make their way into the gloom. The Disclaimer was necessary. As I type this I am just now realizing I forgot to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance. This is a priority and so I recognize now the men and women who go and have gone into harms way to protect the liberties that we as a United States of America hold as unalienable.

47 total with 22 in just for the run and with about 25 for the boot camp workout we form up into two Indian Run lines and begin to make our way to the pre-established warm up zone.

Warm-up - Steve Earle, Finkle Swings, Cotton Pickers, Dive Bombers, Annies, Good Mornings. All of these are fun. Just look them up in the Exicon.

Mosey over to the nearby pickle and partner up for Thang 1

Thang1 - Partners run at the same time but in opposite directions around the pickle to meet on the other side for 10 T-ups, return to start for 20 Merkins, continue process for 30 T-ups, 40 Merkins, 50 T-ups. Plank-hold for the 6.

Form back up into Indian Run formation and make our way over to the trail kiosk. Pair back up with partner for Thang 2.

Thang2 - Partner 1 sprints to the top of the hill while P2 holds plank. Flap jack until each has sprinted the hill 3 times.

Back into Indian Run formation to the rock pile near the Senior Center for Thang3.

Thang 3 - Rapid Fire Rock Work - Curls, Overhead Extensions, Overhead Press, Rock Rows.

Mosey to the courtyard of the Senior Center for some quality wall work in Thang 4.

Thang 4 - Dips, Dirkins, Shoulder Taps, Dirkins, Dips

Mosey back to the start for Mary.

Mary - 100s, Have a Nice Day

COT- 3 FNGs - Smitten, Rock-a-billy, Torpedo
