It has been almost a year since I’ve been back to HB. Being The A Team co-Site Q on the same day makes it tough to get to HB. This is my first since it moved from Apex Nature Park to Sovereign Grace Church. Glad to be back doing KB.

FNG in the house (EH’d by Wahoo and Yahoo). F3-adminstravia done, core values cited, mission cited, credo cited, and lastly, Pledged our Allegiance to Old Gkory.

Off we went to mosey around the pickle and circle up by the flag for warm-ups: GMs, Sir Fazio forward, overhead claps, Sir Fazio backwards, shoulder stretch l/r, calf stretch with Eskimo Merkins to 5 secs between stretches.

Had a feeling Time was close so I asked Meatloaf to be my time hack. He said it’s 6:15. Dang, time flew by so fast, I quickly called an audible to get the PAX back to the flag to close it out. No time to do Mary but we did have time to do burpees x10.

Intimidator was able to get a hold of Monkey Nuts and he posted in the gloom this AM.
