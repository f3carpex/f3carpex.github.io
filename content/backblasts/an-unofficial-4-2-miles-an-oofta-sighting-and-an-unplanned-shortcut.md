So my week-long Birthday Q (which by the way I thought was a thing) got off to a bumpy start. Great workout, plenty of miles, saw some new sites, just bad time management. Apparently there is no wiggle room with the 6:15 finish time. But I appreciate the PAX keeping me honest. Oh, and I told you to bring your gloves @Pet Sounds.

**Warm-Up**

Knowing time was going to be my biggest challenge, we circled up right there in the parking lot at exactly 5:30 for: Imperial Walker, SSH, Finkle Leg Swings, Hillbilly, Bobby Hurley

**Thang 1**

Ran to the Swift Creek Greenway. Before jumping on the greenway we did a set of Erkins and Derkins on the bridge. A little more than halfway through we stopped for some LBCs and Mountain Climbers.

When we arrived at the end of the greenway at Kildaire Farm Rd we bear crawled up the ramp then we Dutch Skated across the bridge, followed by a set of Dips.

We then split into two groups and did an Indian Run to Penny Rd.

**Thang 2**

Paired up for a set of Squerkins.

Then a group run down Penny Rd. to Penny Rd Elementary School. And thanks to @Hermes we now know it's the Home of the Pandas. Paired up again for chill-cut plank partner hop. Hey look there's Oofta!

Group run to Ederlee DR.

**Thang 3**

Scout run to Regency Pkwy.

It was here I had one more thing planned but was informed I only had 5 minutes to get back to the flag. So after the mocking and name-calling ended @Large Mouth suggested a shortcut. I realize now he probably only did it to preserve his Kryptonite distance record, but it was appreciated. Hey look there's Oofta again.

We arrived back at the flag at 6:18.

**COT**

Memorial Day Convergence 2 weeks away. Carpex Crazy Train June 9th.

Praises for @Grease Monkey's mom, wife and kids. All received great news and good reports from their doctors.

YHC concluded with a quote from the book Jonathan Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach

> â€œRisk more than others think is safe. Care more than others think is wise. Dream more than others think is practical. Expect more than others think is possible. There are no mistakes. The events we bring upon ourselves, no matter how unpleasant, are necessary in order to learn what we need to learn; whatever steps we take, they're necessary to reach the places we've chosen to go."
