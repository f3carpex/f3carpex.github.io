It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, but it's beginning to feel a lot like spring.  Five HIM gathered in downtown Cary to enjoy the Christmas lights and 65 degree weather.

**Warm-Up**

Mosey around to the corner parking lot next to the giant Christmas the for side straddle hops, imperial walkers, plank jacks, merkins and mountain climbers.

**The Thang**

Mosey down Academy Street to FUMC, then continue to the fountain while enjoying the Christmas decorations and performing ten merkins at every other light pole.

A large crowd at the fountain and the arts center, so YHC has to improvise.  Indian run down to Walker Street to the big lot next to FUMC for 11's.  Squat jumps at the bottom of the hill, star jumps at the top.

Bear crawl from one island to the next, ten merkins, bear crawl back, ten squats.  Repeato with plank jacks and LBCs.

Indian run back to the pocket park for 12 dips, 12 ALRSUs, 12 derkins, 12 ALRSUs.

**Mary**

Around the horn for dying cock-a-roaches, boat canoe, LBCs, Homer-to-Marge and merkin variation where you balance on one hand while raising the other hand up to the sky.

**COT**

**Count-a-rama**:  5 **Name-a-rama**:  1 RESPECT, 2 mehs, 2 HATES **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for Grease Monkey's M as she continues to fight Lyme disease and his mother as she fights cancer, prayers for my mother as she has surgery on her broken wrist and elbow. **BOM**:  YHC took us out.

**NMS**

We ran into our brother Flip Flop on Academy Street, he was nice enough to critique our merkin form.

The crowd at the art center forced me to improvise.  We ended up with more running than I expected, but I think it was OK.

No one splashed merlot, but someone splashed another, uh, liquid.  I'm not saying who, but he was wearing a do-rag and was not wearing sleeves.

The Rush Hour Pocket Park is the best place in all of Carpex to finish a workout.

Thanks for letting me lead.
