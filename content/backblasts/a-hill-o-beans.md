Twice as many reps as beans in a can.

**Introduction**

For some reason Frisco's pre-blast was reminiscing about the time he watched Casablanca whilst eating cold baked beans from a tin, washing them down with a cocktail of absinthe and Dr. Pepper. However, interesting fact, the workout I planned had approximately twice as many reps in it as there are beans in a standard can. So, remarkably on point.

**All the thangs - 1000 challenge**

Can you fit 1000 reps into a 45minute AO? When it's limited (zero) run and you do 40 seconds on, 8 seconds off, yes, you can. Grab a tricep extension rock, find your personal, distanced sweet sweat spot on a curb and go:

- 20 SSH in cadence
- 10 merkins
- 10 monkey humpers

4.5 times the following:

- 20 Merkins
- 20 Tricep extensions
- 20 Squats
- 20 Backward lunges
- 20 Freddie Mercuries (in cadence)
- 20 Carolina dry docks
- 20 Star jumps
- 20 Mountain climbers (in cadence)
- 20 LBCs
- 20 Forward lunges

10 Star jumps to bring it up to 1000 reps total.

**COT**

Prayers for Frisco's wife. Prayers for our leaders and to give us strength to support one another in these trying times. Praises for the opportunity for us to get out and start the day together.

**Ramblings**

This workout turned out to be quite hard. I knew that in theory, once a term I used to lead a variant of the 1000 challenge workout at a bootcamp at university. I modified this one to have no running in it, which reduces the time needed somewhat, but still, we were going all out for 40mins, plus getting and replacing rocks. There was surprisingly little mumbling from the PAX (I couldn't hear anything anyway through the rushing of blood in my ears). There was a request for some more running next time. :-)

I'm feeling it now. I hope everyone else had a great time!
