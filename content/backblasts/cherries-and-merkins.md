**Pre-Blast** 

This being my virgin Q, it was great to do at BO as it was my FNG site.  I really appreciated all the help from and support from the PAXs, before and during workout.

Hermes brought cherries, Lite Brite provided water, and Burt provided tank tops.

Ran to the bank and circled up to do:

20 - side saddle hop

From there we did light pole exercise to fountain with 10 LBCs at each light pole.
