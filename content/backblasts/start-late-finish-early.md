4am. 10 month old is up and Daddy Dooty begins. Roughly 510, YHC sneeks out of nursery, dresses and hits the door in hopes to make the 520 pre run. As I come flying in, I see an empty parking lot. Luckily, Denali arrives a few min later and we take off on a leisurely stroll through Cary's finest back roads. 542, we both realize we are going to be late getting back. Leisurely stroll turns in to a full out sprint. Arrive at 546 with the PAX already on the move....so the cluster begins!

Quickly catch the front of the line and takes the reins from Pickles. TY4YL! Couple of moseys around the circle, adding in some KARAOKE. Multiple reminders that this is a "non running"workout, so we circle up for Warm ups.

We did this as a group. Starting with 5 Burpees, we then ran around the circle and back to start. Adding an exercise with each circle run.

Headed over to tennis courts for some down and backs. 6 tennis courts. Starting at the outside line of the first court, we lunged to the other outside line of same court. Followed by 10 Squats. Shuffle to next outside line of court 2, bearcrawl to other outside line. 10 Squats. Rinse and repeat through the 6 courts. Followed by Peoples Chair at the end. Frisco led us with 10 terrible 10 counts.

REPEATO, except insert Star Jumps for Squats. More Peoples Chair at the end. Frisco count to 20, sort of.

Back to the flag for some AB work and ended promptly at 627ish.

- Apologies for being late. This is a rather large pet peeve of mine as I have always lived by the "if you are early, you are on time" motto. 10 Penalty Burpees were performed at the end.
- Felt good to get back in the saddle and lead a workout. This was my first limited running Q, always good to get out of the comfort zone
- Congrats again to the Tobacco Road runners, was good to see some of them this morning.
