Given last night's brawl, YHC led the 14 men at SNS through a rock-centric workout. Not because he is a Kansas fan, or a Kansas State hater, but only because of the word-relation between Rock Chalk Jayhawk and rocks. So after a short warmup and some Nolan Ryans (fighting related) and People's Chair (Kansas player almost used a chair in the fight), the PAX spent 30 minutes with a pile of rocks. Curls, presses, extensions, rows, squats, rockees, rock ups, and more while mixing up which rocks each man used. Add in three Billy runs and you got yourself a workout.

More important than what workout we did, or who was there, is that there is no place for what happened last night in college sports, or any sports, or anywhere. Especially three days after MLK day. Did you know that MLK preached six days of nonviolence? Yes, he did. Here they are:

1. Nonviolence is a way of life for courageous people. It is active nonviolent resistance to evil.
2. Nonviolence seeks to win friendship and understanding. The end result of nonviolence is redemption and reconciliation.
3. Nonviolence seeks to defeat injustice, not people. Nonviolence recognizes that evildoers are also victims.
4. Nonviolence holds that suffering can educate and transform. Nonviolence willingly accepts the consequences to its acts.
5. Nonviolence chooses love instead of hate. Nonviolence resists violence to the spirit as well as the body. Nonviolence love is active, not passive. Nonviolence love does not sink to the level of the hater. Love restores community and resists injustice. Nonviolence recognizes the fact that all life is interrelated.
6. Nonviolence believes that the universe is on the side of justice. The nonviolent resister has deep faith that justice will eventually win.

Thank you men for a glorious morning. Now go make it a glorious day.
