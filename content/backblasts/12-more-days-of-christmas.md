I naturally assume that most of the Pax are getting a little burned out on "12 days" themed work outs so what better way to celebrate the coming of the new year than with another one! Right?

No Meow Mile!?

**Warm up:**

- 2nd stop - 12x Plank Jacks SC

- 4th stop - 12x Mountain Climbers SC

Repeato and subract 1 rep until there are none.

Run to the next parking lot were we have 2 stops (1 on each side of the lot) Pax can choose how to get across the lot but can not run across. Carioca, side stradles, backwards run, High Knee skips were in full effect.
