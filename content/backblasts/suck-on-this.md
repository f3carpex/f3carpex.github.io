A few weeks ago YHC and other HIM found ourselves admiring a large rock pile after A-Team. We have all run by this pile several times and not seen it due to darkness on the way in or tiredness on the way out. Last night when YHC agreed to take on the Q, YHC knew what must be done.

  
Mosey to the rock pile near the front of the park, each pax picked up a rock to carry for the duration of the workout.
