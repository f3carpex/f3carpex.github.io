YHC planned for some music to enhance the enjoyment of the beatdown and thankfully the theme from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was not on the playlist. Since the speaker and phone were already set up on the field, a little/lotta rain wasn't going to change my plan.

No FNGs, but lots of new faces and we were off. Mozy around parking lot and enter first soccer field.

Glad I decided to Q at FOD. I was a regular here until FWD opened. It is just hard to not go to the closest AO to my home. So many new faces, which was great to see. I will need to return again soon. But I encourage the guys who are only posting at FOD to check out some of the other AOs in Carpex.

My weather app really sucks. It said no rain until 7 but it basically poured the entire time.

Artists from the playlist - Aerosmith, Tom Petty, Springsteen, Zep, Jethro Tull, Rush, Pink Floyd, Foreigner, Nirvana (No BJ Thomas)

The goal with the varying distances was to try to have everyone finish around the same time. It sort of worked. At least Large didn't finish 5 minute ahead of everyone.

Franklin showed off his running skills by joining the fast group and seemed to keep up. Then he wouldn't stop when calling WW2s. I am pretty sure most were done sometime between 25 and 30.

I think we can all agree that Beaker's prayer request is an area where we can all improve. Thank you Beaker

Always an honor and privilege to lead.
