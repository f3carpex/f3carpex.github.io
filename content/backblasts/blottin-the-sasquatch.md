17 PAX came out for the shadiest CSAUP route this side of New Hampshire. Of the ~12 miles covered, I think maybe a mile was full sun. You have got to love the greenways out here!

A few weeks back, YHC saw @F3ENC post on twitter 'bout their annual Sasquatch CSAUP going virtual. This is an event I know Yogi and Freebird have hit up in the past and raved about. Checking in with HK to make sure he wasn't aware of anyone else trying to organize something locally, I decided to give hosting a version in CARPEx. The called-for layour (10 miles total starting with 3.5 mile runs and some AOs in between) immediately brought TGM to mind. So many many dozens of minutes (OK, several hours) and lots of half-listened-to conference calls later, YHC had what turned out to be a terrible idea:  
\- a one-way, shuttle-car-required tour de Cary from Green Mile through Bond and over to Godbold.

Luckily Parker talked me out of that stupid idea and a less adventurous but definitely more easily executable route was born. And speaking of Parker, many many kudos for the help in making sure we had plenty of water, a solid SAG crew and an all-round safe and fun time out.

SAG crew of WWW, Blowout, Flenderson and FNG Tyler Durbin were fantastic as well. Great company and help with motivation, hydration and directions. Ya'll make things much more enjoyable. Gracias!

### COT back at the flag

YHC shared a bit of background on the Sasquatch. Have a chat with Saban if you want to learn more about Papa Smurf or post with the brothers in F3ENC as the man seems to have touched everyone out there.

Prayers for wisdom and patience re: school. And for the administrators and teachers who are also being yo-yo'ed around as much as the parents.

Prayers for Bonnie. Prayers for Slappy. Prayers for Banjo's 2.0.

We named FNG Durden after [Tyler Durden](https://fightclub.fandom.com/wiki/Tyler_Durden). FNG Spurs was named after his favorite [EPL club](https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/).

### NMS:

Great to be out here with PAX from all over the region. First CSAUP for many. For the rest... we were left wondering why.

Said it before and will say it again: many thanks to the HIMs who helped pull this together.
