I'm feeling compelled to write more about this perfect word - _INVIGORATE!_  
As a VQ this morning, I humbly admit that I (jumped at the chance, but) did not come in completely and fully prepared to lead the HIM at WWW, but when it came time to provide the disclaimer to our FNG (Decal), invigorate was the important word that I remembered and emphasized.  
Merriam Webster provides this simple, yet profound (IMO) definition to the term; "to give life and energy to."  
  
Truth be told, I was in sincere need of - and praying for - invigoration in my life, back in late July (and long before that). Boiled down to the basics, I had just dropped my M and 2.0s off at the airport and feeling sad I wasn't able to join them. Runs are good medicine for me so there I was on a lonely, routine, solo run around Lake Pine (not to discount this awesome trail and lake), when I came upon a large group of men- they were also on the move - in the same direction I was heading. A HIM (certainly didn't know the term at the time) gave me a quick plug while jogging next to me and almost immediately after that I spotted a friend. I kept on my way, but reached out to HIM (ha, see what I did there...) to confirm it was him when I got to work. He provided me such a compelling testimony, I was super excited to get on board, and gave him the commitment that I would. I don't know the name of the A-Team HIM that grabbed my attention, but the friend I spotted is Bubba. I am SO grateful, for both men!  
  
For a guy that has traveled a pretty fair amount, I knew when our family landed in Apex, this place is something special. Same goes for F3, I'm coming to realize, this is something special and life changing!  
  
Not to drag this on long, but I really thought I owed some more background to what brought me here to this point (besides Almighty God's plan of course..).  
  
So back to WWW this morning... Coming off BRR weekend, half of our PAX were participants in this epic event on 9/11 and 9/12, including YHC. For this I here reiterate a huge thanks to Schlitz!

Anyhow, after the disclaimer to the FNG (that Schlitz helped to fully articulate), we said the pledge and were off for a LONG mosey around the traffic circle.

We circled back up on the upper flat lot in front of AFHS, and moved to (Control Freak) Good Mornings, Side Straddle Hops, and Runners' Calf Stretches.

Then we moseyed down the hill to break in to 4 groups of 2 for 3 rounds of upper body. The partner that stayed Dips and Derkins off the wood guardrail. The other ran back to the traffic circle, paused for 10 Burpees and 10 LBCs and returned to relieve their partner. Tri's and shoulders on fire, we made our way back towards the upper lot. This is when 16 Steves called an excellent audible and had us all grab a rock for extensions out - to the left - and to the right. (Upper body was a focus coming off BRR)

We Mary'd back up at the upper lot and the team joined in on American Hammers and 1 legged Homer to Marges until we went nearly around the horn as (Hamm, Flenderson, Lucky Charms, etc.) the HIMs volunteered their own exercises; Plank-until-your-turn-5-count-merkins, Low Slow Flutters, and others I'm either forgetting and/or don't know the names of... Schiltz brought us home with some excellent runner stretches that were completely on point (again - post BRR Monday).

We volunteered the pertinent announcements and YHC closed out the group with a brief reflection on Hebrews 12, then prayer. Prayers for Schlitz's loved one Frank and my M who is currently caught in bit of a 'COVID crossfire' at work.

YHC was super appreciative of the entire group making it to coffeeteria at VF, special thanks to Two Factor's generosity!

Oddly enough, when I Google Images of Invigorate, this is what came up. I don't know about you, but in my imagination, this could very well what my straining eyes would see when peering at the image of God! Coincidence? I'll let you decide.
