I'm a Bruisers true-n-true and I'm so glad we have this option for those who still want to be out. Frisco and McCants, HIMs who continue to drive only to make themselves better even with some IR issues. The Bruiser motto is to find the purpose is to be out in the gloom for some fitness, fellowship, and have faith with the brothers.

Shank started the pax out right with a short run to the first stop to warm up. Us Bruisers made it there eventually at our own bruiser pace to get some. Once the pax were done, they moseyed, as well as us in bruiser fashion, to the running track.

Thang 1

Four corners

1) 25 merkins

2) 25 jump squats or squats

3) 25 merkins

4) 25 jump squats or squats.

We moseyed bruiser style to the pax for thang 2

Dora 1-2-3 (100 merkins, 200 LBC and 300 calf raises)

I was willing to partner up but Frisco called individual Dora. I crazily went along. Goodness gracious, I was light headed after completing the merkins and LBC in speed time to finish the same time as the rest of the pax. Suckage I tell you, suckage. I modified and did squats vs. calf raises. Who said Bruisers is easy ... HIIT Brother.

We connected back with McCants and moseyed over to the playground equipment to do Bruiser's thang 3 (dirkins, dips, and more squats) while the rest of the pax did 3 rounds of mini-Murph. I called the last Bruiser exercise of curbpees. As we approached 10 reps, I called an audible and tacked on an extra 5. You should have heard Frisco complaint-chatter. He showed me though and finished strong ... proud of you Brother!

We went for a bruiser pace walk to hook back up with McCants but he was no where to be found. I almost placed a 911 call for a missing HIM but as we made it back to the COT, my worry was lifted. He was with the rest of the pax working on Mary.

Frisco and I merged in to finish up the workout.

I'm always proud to be out in the gloom with the F3 Carpex Brothers. You all are l3@l) @33â‚¬3!!!
