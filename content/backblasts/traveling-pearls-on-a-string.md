A warm, Monday morning greeted 12 HIM for a rare Earhart Q outside of Hell’s Bells on Mondays.  Many new faces to me, imagine that posting somewhere else for a change.  We head out around the pickle, with a backwards run down the hill.  A quick detour to the curb for some quick feet before finally circling up for:

## Warm Up

Good mornings

Cotton Pickers

Side Straddle Hops

Hillbillies

 

## The Thang

Done with our warm-ups, Q has plans to travel outside of the park so what better way to travel than with jack webs!  And even better traveling burpee jack webs (ascending burpees with four count hand raises/halleluiahs), with the first two in the parking lot by the flag.

We catch the light crossing Davis Drive and mosey to the first lighted intersection for the next round of jack webs.  Q unfortunately screwed up the round by going early on the hand raises before finishing our 3-count burpees.  Luckily I had Hermes to remind me and then subsequently call out how many we needed to do and how many hand raises.

Down the hill through the gloom, we finish up at the bottom of the hill with 10-count burpees and 40 hand raises (per Hermes I finally got it right).  We mosey into the playground for some triple nickels.  Q asks the PAX to divide-up into three groups/stations and perform 5 rounds of:

5 Pull-ups

10 Merkins

15 Starjumps

Finish-up grab a bench for three quick rounds of left-right step-ups and dips.  Line-up for an Indian Run to Davis Middle School (waving to Principal Roony).  Because it so well-lit (weird for Wolverine), we find a handy rock-pile near the trail.  Grab an ego rock and circle up for 3 quick rounds of curls, overhead presses, and rock-rows.

Finished up and returned our rock, in some cases threw them, we need to get back to the flag.  Again, what better way to get back than by traveling jack-webs, this time Captain Thors (ascending big-boy situps with a four count American Hammers).  Initial 2-count Thors’d at the school with a mosey back down Davis stopping occasionally for two sets before finishing the last two rounds in a circle by the flag.

The bell tolls 6:15 and we are done.
