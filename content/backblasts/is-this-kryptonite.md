QIC: Staubach

Once again, I had a master workout plan that would have taken at least 1.5 hours to complete. After having made this mistake more than once, I was able to adjust the schedule and get the PAX back to camp in time for some high intensity exercises before MARY and COT.

As we were heading out of the parking lot...there was already some grumbling about the fact we would be running. References to Kryptonite and the BRR were being used like a 4 letter word. That did not discourage the Q.....we were on a path to find the steepest hill we could find. After calling a 3 station Blimp workout it became very clear that the circle of hills was a bit longer than the Q anticipated. Nonetheless we powered on and made it through. Once everyone was completely tired of running....we of course got into 3 lines and did an Indian Run back to the flag.

Hereâ€™s how it went down this morning at SWW

Warm Up:

Staubach announced all the disclaimers (we had and FNG), led us in the pledge then headed off the parking lot on Kildaire to warm up.
