Another glorious night in DTC, ok, it was gloomy and misty. It had been awhile since my last Q. I have been working on this idea for awhile. I arrived early to set up and Old Maid was already on his way out for an EC run, 4+ miles. 4 other did a EC around the ToC campus. Red Ryder let me know of a possible FNG he was bringing. I was nervous, since I had never Q'd when we had an FNG. Theismann gave me some good advice while on our EC run.

**4 Minute Warning**: Yes 4 minutes. I wanted to make sure I got in the mission and disclaimer with a FNG.

**Mission & Disclaimer:** Mission stated and a very lengthy disclaimer that I have been working on. The lawyers would have been pleased.

**Pledge & Warm Up:**  
\* Pledge stated a bit early, just excited to get going  
\* Mosey to Academy Street entrance of Town Hall.  
Sir Fazio's, seal claps, Imperial Walkers. mosey to center courtyard: daisey pickers, good evenings.

**Thang 1: 11's**  
From the middle courtyard: 1 Pull ups on the bridge (One Four's secret pull up spot), run up the stairs, 1 CDD, down the stairs. Repeat Ended up being about 1 mile when complete. A pickle with stairs. The pull ups on the I-beams under the bridge leading into Town Hall can cause damage to ungloved hands.

**Thang 2: 4 Corner's DORA**  
I had collected some items from school that I thought would be fun to carry around a parking lot. Full sized CMU's; 12 foot beams; and wooden pallets. I placed a set of each on the corners. The plan was for partner teams to carry the items around the parking lot stopping at each corner and performing an exercise:  
Round 1: Carry coupon, 15 merkins per person at every corner  
Round 2: Carry different coupon, 25 squats per person at every corner  
Round 3: Different coupon, 40 LBC's per person at every corner.

My directions were less than clear. Free Bird and I and Red Ryder and FNG Dennis did it exactly as planned. I know who listens well or were at least close enough to me to follow the example. There were a variety of other scenarios. It was impressive to see everyone else carrying 2 full sized cmu's, or a 12 foot beam, or a wood pallet around the parking and doing the exercise too. Some serious HIM's.  
**Mary:**  
\- Freddy Merc's and Peter Parkers  
**Count-a-roma:** 7 Respect's (including FNG); the rest Meh's  
**COT:**  
\- Remember TPC Sawgrass is coming up. Watch for new AO's opening.  
\- Prayers: Those who are healing, Pet Sounds. Unspoken prayers.  
\- FNG Dennis: Now known as Mr. Wilson, as in Dennis the Menace's neighbor. EH'd by Red Ryder. BRR Respect recruit. Solid performance, strong addition. Thanks Red.  
**NMS:**  
\- I visited my 93 year old father-in-law prior to Rush Hour. He has dementia and has difficulty remember his daughters' names, wife, etc. I shared with him what I was doing later and he just grinned. He recalled his time playing high school and junior college football. His high school principal Mr. Macon who would drive to his house and say "Get your ass in the car, you're going to football practice." Time can take away a lot of memories, but the memories created by working hard with quality men are difficult to forget.  
\- Thanks for the quality men who were there last night. Thanks for the opportunity to lead you and create some memories.  
\- Oh, Captain Kirk rolled in after 7:00 wondering what was going on. I dropped him off at the Pharmacy and apparently the conversations were varied and, as usual, interesting.
