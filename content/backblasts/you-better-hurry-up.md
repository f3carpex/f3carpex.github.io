# You Better Hurry Up.....

Many years ago, my grandpa used to say, "You better hurry up".  I never fully understood that phrase until I got older.  Now that I'm a respect, I fully understand what Paw Paw was saying.  When I look at my kids, my wife, my career, I realize that time is very precious, now more than ever.  And if I needed any additional reminders, when speaking with @Frisco on the way back from JoCo, I told him about my bucket list.  He quickly looked at me and said "You know you are running out of time".  Thanks @Frisco.

So today's beat down was meant to be high tempo with no breaks at all.  We only have 45 minutes to get a good workout and we don't want to waste any time.  In other words, we need to hurry up.....

I spoke with Co-Q @Sooey who bought into the theme and his Thang 1 and 2 were designed with keep the pax moving constantly.  No time wasted here.....  Here we go.

18 PAX, No FNGs

**Warm Up** A start of the playlist blared out Walk on Water, the Hello Kitty Pick Up the Six podcast song.  And with that, it was time to briskly sprint to the warm up area.  All business, no breaks

SSH \* 15 Sir Fazio \* 15 forward and backward 5 Penalty Burpees (due to late PAX) 15 Merkins OMD 20 Plank Jacks 20 Mountain Climbers 10 Burpees OMD Calf Stretch (because they were forgotten earlier)

**Thang 1 - Shelter Work** Pax turned over to @Sooey for a run down to the far shelter.  Music was blaring which YHC really loves.  Playlist in NMS. @Sooey paired up Pax very quickly.  No time to waste. Partner 1 in shelter for AMRAP Dips, Irkins, Step-Ups Partner 2 runs the pickle Flap Jack

**Thang 2 - 11's on the Hill** Pax ran down the main A-Team road to the bridge right before the hill.  Looks like a perfect place for 11's.

1 Star Jump at the top 10 LBCs on the bottom

**Mary** Brisk run to top parking lot for a round of Mary called by the Pax.

**Announcements** Review of clown car to Joco on Saturday.  @Frisco and @Disco did a great job on the Q. OST gifts are due Friday.  Collection by site Qs. Cary parade Saturday Dec 8. CARPEX Christmas party.

**Prayers** For Cataracts job interview this week. Disco's M.  Rough week last week. YHC took us out.

**NMS** YHC is super amazed at just how early some Pax get up for EC runs.  Today's EC run included Hello Kitty, Chipper, Two Factor, Disco Duck, Sooey and YHC.  Running is still tough but Duck did not let me quit.  Thanks Duck.

Freaking Frisco was a beast at A-Team this morning.  I don't know what got into him but he was on fire.  He was digging deep on the runs and giving major motivation to the Pax to stay strong.  Way to go Frisco.

Thanks Kitty for my new favor motivational song:  Walk on Water.  Some days are harder than others.  I was definitely feeling it today with the music blaring.

Play list: Walk on Water - Thirty Seconds to Mars Old Time Rock & Roll - Bob "Disco Duck" Seger Rock Star - Nickelback Numb - Linkin Park Come as You Are - Nirvana Last Resort - Papa Roach Juke Box Hero - Foreigner Fat Bottomed Girls - Queen (Goose called Freddy Murcuries when this was playing at Mary).

YHC is very thankful to be motivated by all of these high quality HIMs that post on a daily basis.  This has definitely encouraged me to up my game in the workouts and in life.  Thanks guys.

YHC Out.
