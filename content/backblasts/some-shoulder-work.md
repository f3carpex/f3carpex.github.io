3 for the 2.5 mile EC run in and out - Old Maid, Hot Spot and Squatter Some others did some EC run stuff. Biner wore the breathtaker thing without smiling

A total of 21 were there at the start and I think it was our FNG - Rahm that was a little late. Thang HiLighter: - Warmup including GM, HB, IW, SSH, and some penalty burpees and probably something else i am forgetting. - Double merkin Jack Webbs to 20 merkins and 40 hallelujahs. - Mosey to the nice new field for full length field suicides with a Burpee at the "18" (whatever that means), 1-legged burpee a the half, a plank jack at the next "18" and another one-legged burpee at the end.  Doing 5 merkins at the base line each time.  Then do all of that again with star jumps as opposed to Merkins. - BTTW to transition to YHC

Thang Hermes: - 10 count down the line BTTW, alternating regular, left arm up and right arm up. - Circle up on the "Centre" circle for 50 LBCs IC, 10 Clerkins, 25 LBCs IC, Jumping Spider (Plyo Merkins) - Mosey to the picnic shelter for some Erkins, Derkins and Dips. 20 then 15. Make it Clerkins. - Mosey back to the railing to the nice new soccer field. Aussie Pullups x 20, Air Squats x 50, Aussie Pullups x 20, Air Squats x 25. - Mosey back to the flag to finish with one-arm merkins x 5 each arm and a silent reflective Have a Nice Day.

Count-a-rama - 22 Name-a-rama - 3 respects i think, the rest were Mehs.  Welcome FNG Rahm! Announcements - Banjo is raising money for his mission trip by selling Chicken Dinners with nanner pudding at FUMC tonight.  $10 per plate, $40 max for a family (Ascot and Sky Blue- you need to do this!).  There was another announcement that was likely important, but I wasnt paying attention.

Prayer Requests - A middle school boy - Max in Shut-In's middle school group he leads at church lost his father suddenly and tragically this week.  Franklin's M and some unexpected complications in an outpatient surgery yesterday.  HiLighter's father and family.

NMS: Great group of men this morning.  Good to see some new (to me) faces.  I was pushed by a couple guys to get out of my regular comfort zone at least once a week and post somewhere outside my norm.  I would highly encourage you to do the same!

I appreciate your patience in my marginally adequate leadership this morning.

We are getting some daylight now during our workouts!

Do you think Rahm likes pickles on his chicken sandwiches?

I appreciate you guys sharpening me on a regular basis!
