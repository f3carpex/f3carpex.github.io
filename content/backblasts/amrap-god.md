First time Q'ing SWW and within mere moments, I'm already in love with this AO -- it has errthing, including a nice 3-mile EC hosted by Hermes.

As for the regularly scheduled beat-down.

**Warmup:**

- From lot 1 to lot 2 for SSH, Good Mornings, Imperial Walkers, 10 Burpees (thanks Jigglypuff).

**Thang 1:** Timed AMRAP for Merkins and LBC

- In lot 1 for 15 seconds of AMRAP Merkins and LBCs
- Move to lot 2 for 30 seconds of AMRAP Merkins and LBCs
- Keep going back-and-forth in the lots for 15-30-45-60-45-30-15 sets of AMRAP

**Thang 2:** Timed AMRAP for L/R step up and people's chair/B2W

- Shelter for L/R step ups and against the bathroom building for people's chair/B2W
- 15-30-45-60-45-30-15 on the AMRAP.
- Note that the 30 and 15 on the back end were B2W thanks to Brother Giles.

**Cool-down:** Just enough time for a cool down of 4 suicides on the basketball court and a Quad-pack of Mary.

**NMS:** YHC took us out with a message of St. Joseph, who this week (Monday) celebrated a feast day. Think about what Joseph was asked to do, and he didn't run from it, he embraced it and took that responsibility on his shoulders. May we be more like Joseph, humble servants of the Lord. Thanks for the chance to lead and as always, "attack the day with an enthusiasm unknown to man." -- Kitty
