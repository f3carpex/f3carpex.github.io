No one claimed the clean gloves I picked up two weeks ago at wolverine, they are clean. Gloves are optional this morning. No new guys. Mosey to the Park Village pool parking lot to warm up with various exercises including runners stretch and pigeon pose. Recover  
  
Mosey to top of hill at the second island, on Park Village Drive. Low squat waiting on instructions:  
\- Run to playground at bottom of hill.  
\- Complete a minimum of 10 pull-ups + as many more as you are able.  
\- Run to the second island top of hill.  
\- Complete 1/2 Mucho Chesto; 5 regular merkins - 5 diamond - 5 wide grip - 5 left forward-5 right forward.  
\- AMRAP for time.  
\- #PUT6  
  
Two line Indian run back to the flag, black shirts vs colors.  
  
Various Mary exercises finishing with a very respectful silent and introspective HAVE A NICE DAY! Actually we did five Burpees before the have a nice day. There has been a lot of chatter among the pax during many HANDs, and a lot of discussion on how the pax would prefer silence. So rather than being a Richard and calling HAND and then penalizing the pax with burpees for MC, we kicked off the Burpeeâ€˜s before hand.  
  
16 pax  
Announcement: 4th of July convergence at Bond Park kicks off at 7:04 AM, be there by 6:45 for the fellowship. Bring something to share afterwards. Pre-ruck kicks off at 5:45 AM.  
Various prayers and praises were shared.  
  
NMS.  
\- Did someone say Macho Man spewed merlow? Please say it so.  
\- Honeycomb has kicked it up a notch, nice!  
\- Strong work but are you man this morning.  
  
OK, YHC has BRR on the mind. That means hills and miles. We got both along with an antidote for soccer arms.

Thank you men, Banjo
