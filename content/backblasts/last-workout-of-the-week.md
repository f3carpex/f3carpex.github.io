20 Pax hit up the Naturest of all Parks in Apex for a Friday morning beatdown. YHC pre-blasted that we'd be using the pull-up bars and the turf. Let's see how it went down.

**0545 -** Disclaimer and Pledge

**Warmup -** No signature warm up. Instead we pranced the parking lot back and forth with butt kickers, high knees, shuffles, karaoke, and a couple warm up exercises.

**Thang 1 -** We headed to the pond and partnered up, each getting a rock. P1 / P2 flapjacked between 20 reps of curls, tris, presses, squats. While one partner just simply held their rock above their head.

**Thang 2 -** YHC laid out the 4 stops on the pond circuit:  
1 - Rocks (squats - lap 1 / curls n' tris lap 2)  
2 - World's Worst Pull-Ups  
3 - Lunge walk to stop 4  
4 - Mary where newer pax could work on their cadence counting and everything that goes with calling an exercise.  
  
We did two laps and put our rocks back and headed for the turf

**Thang 3 -** YHC put out a test of grit, stamina, and strength. For most guys Friday is the last workout of the week. So we were going to push ourselves knowing 2 days of rest were upon us. And the pax did just that!

YHC called for a 100yard Bear Crawl. _But don't stand up and don't quit_. Everyone did it! Then we ran back across the field and did it again for 50yards. AND NO ONE QUIT. It was awesome!!

0630 - COT and we were OUT!
