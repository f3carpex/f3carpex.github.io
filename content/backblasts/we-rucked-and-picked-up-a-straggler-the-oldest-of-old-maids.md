Day 5 / Q #5. I had things planned with pain stations but when a cold or flu bug hits, you modify as needed.

It was a balmy 28 degrees this morning and I had 4 rucking beast ready to get our ruck on.

Ma Bell pulled the classic bait and switch with the GM boys and they had some Churham boys waiting in haste to get their party started. Ma Bell took the beatdown to the Churham PAX.

Anyway, we Rucker's headed out and noticed there was a loan PAX ahead of us with some Christmas bling to light up his way. It was the oldest of Old Maids. We got him to join us so we can fellowship with him. I love how we will never leave no man behind and never leave them where we found them.

We got over 2+ miles in and a lot of good stories.

I found out during coffeeteria that we put in more distance than the boot campers. How is that? No worries, they still got a workout in so it was a plus.

We met up with the GM PAX to close it out.

COR: 6

NOR: solid rucking HIMs.

It is always an honor to get out in the gloom with some crazy Brothers who just want to workout and fellowship so they can accelerate in life.
