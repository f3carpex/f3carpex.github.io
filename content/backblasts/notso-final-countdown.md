Thank God the rain stopped just prior to 5:45, but it was chilly for sure!  Tight group of 4 for the bootcamp, but we certainly made the most of it…also caught glimpses of Skipper-the Rucker (not Skipper - the bootcamper/runner) working hard wrestling some kind of bag….While once again the weather certainly could have been better, but it didn't stop me from thoroughly enjoying a tight group of dedicated men. 

No FNGs, only familiar faces.  The group was informed that this is F3 – modify as necessary!  Started with the Pledge & across Academy St. for…. 

The Warm Up

Circle up for Hill Billies, SSH, standard merkins, Sir Fazios, etc.

Mosey to the empty lot behind the Chamber of Commerce for Bear Crawl Countdown City – count down from 10 to 1 – bear crawl 10 parking spaces for 10 merkins, mosey back to the start for 9 of each, etc.  

Thang 2

Mosey to the Town of Cary Palace for Aussie pull-ups with alternating bear crawls across the drive & dips down at the fountain.  Countdown from 20 Aussies, bear crawl, 18 Aussies, dips, etc.  Nice work gentlemen!

Head to the grassy area for some Mary – side plank star crunches

Move on to the upper pickle – classic 7’s:  Burpees on upper corner with star jumps on the lower corner – fun times! 

Mosey back to the flag for some quick Mary.
