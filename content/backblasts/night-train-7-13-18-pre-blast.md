### What

Board the Amtrak in Cary. Take it to Raleigh. Ruck back. It's about 14 miles.

### When

July 13, 2018. We're aiming for the 6:08 train departing DTC. We will update Slack and Twitter @ruckCarpex with any delays. This should put us DTR at around 6:30, and it's about a 4-hour ruck (yes, I'm pretty sure) back. The finish line is at Bond Brothers. The later train is at 10-something, and if it were delayed, we'd be in for a late night. Which is fine. But BB might not stay open that long, and that's an important part of the experience.

### Who

Anyone. Seriously. We've got gear to loan, and it's about the #ruckership. F3, FIA, FNG, anyone.

### How

Bring a ruck if you got it, your choice of weight, hydration bladder or at least 1L of bottle capacity. Headlamp and reflective strips for after dark. $7 for the train.

### Why

We need a reason? Join us!
