Lower temps and humidity made for a perfect night at Rush Hour. It was nice to get back to some bootcamp training after the BRR training. The blocks I carry in the bed of truck came in handy.

2 minute warning; No FNG's; Mission; pledge; and we are off. Well sort of, Press On is trying to EH a friendly, heavily tattooed, dude on a bike. The dude admitted to smoking a lot of weed and not being in good cardio shape. He said he was 62 and mocked us young guys. That did not discourage Press On. Dude biked with us as we moseyed to check to see if Jordan Lake was open. He decided to move on after our first warm up of SSH's. FYI: Jordan Lake is not opened on Tuesdays.

5 for 2ndF at Pharmacy. I left early; I had to get home for some Skylight Inn BBQ, beans, coleslaw, and cornbread. It was spectacular.  
Make it a great week.
