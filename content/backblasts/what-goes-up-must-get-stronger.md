YHC arrives early to get in EC run,  but not feeling it,  opting instead for community service and picking up trash at the skate park.  Anyone want a cooler?

No FNGs, met Mud Buddy, good to see Lookout drinking the Kool Aid, Garfield leads us through the pledge,  gloves are optional,  we're off.

Run, not mosey,  to Jones Carey Park with stop on the way to warmup with various exercises including pigeon stretch.  Most were to the cadence of men sharing stories.  Garfield learned that your most embarrassing moment becomes one of the funniest with the passage of time - ask Mud Buddy about his name. 

Finish the run to the park  
\- 10 Swing set crunch merkins  
\- 15 dips  
\- Crawl bear up the hill to parking lot.

Mosey through the woods to the cemetery, run the cemetery Loop,  clockwise, 5 rounds.  
\- Start at the bottom of West Moore Street  
\- 100% AYG uphill, right turn and recovery mosey to the corner  
\- 5 burpees.  
\- Pickup the pace as you head down and back to the bottom of the hill  
\- 10 Travolta merkins.  
\- Repeat 4 more rounds with AYG up hill,  then pick up the 6.

Mosey through woods, AYG up the Holloman Street hill beside Apex Baptist then fellowship mosey back to the flag.    
  
Lookout and Mud Buddy led us in Mary followed with a quiet meditative have a nice day. 

When life is sweet, say thank you and celebrate. When life is bitter, say thank you and grow.

Make it a great day men. Banjo
