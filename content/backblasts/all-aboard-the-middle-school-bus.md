A brisk cool morning greeted the kids waiting for the bus this morning on their way to Salem Middle School.  The gathered in the parking lot and waited patiently for 5:30.

Apparently, the bus driver (who was their early) wanted to protest the start time so we didn't get moving until 5:31.  Largemouth wondered if he was going to make everyone stand around until 5:45.  While it seemed like a good idea....

First exercise - one burpee OYO - Term Paper told me he hoped we did a minimal amount of burpees - so we did - one more than i was planning but a good way to start.  Then off around the pickle - small kosher per old maid, others referenced Bristol.  We went around 3 times - trying to make sure the distance registered on Michelobs watch and then circled up for Warm up -  GM x10, Abe Vigoda x12, HB x14, followed by another lap around the pickle.

We headed out of the parking lot and up top to the road before promptly U-turning and getting on the school bus.  The Thang was the school bus ride into the school.  Stopping at most lamp posts to pick up the kids.  The kids were anxious, doing quick feet x10 and knee tuck jumps x 10 while waiting for the bus and then 10 squats as the bus arrived and squatted down to pick them up.  During the bus ride, we had one altercation between Nature Boy and Large Mouth - the bus driver (YHC) stopped the bus and made them do 5 penalty burpees in front of the group to get them back under control.  Then the bus continued on to the school.

Once we arrived at the school, we went in (sort of) and did some work near the entrance - Dips, ALRSU, Irkins x15, repeat x 10 and repeat x 5.  After some work, we went around the corner for recess which consisted of Peoples Chair (with each person doing 5 merkins down the line) and BTTW (with each person doing 3 squats down the line).  Somewhere during recess, Shut-In got out of line so the teacher made him to penalty burpees as well.

After recess - we ran up the stairs - then down, then up, then down, then hopped up (all right next to a car that had pulled into the lot and was scared to get out) before heading out on our field trip to the elementary school.  Once we reached our destination - we had field trip fun with 7s (LBCs and star jumps) and also stopped for some story telling by Callahan (during hello dolly of course).

Once the field trip was over, we headed back to the road - (which included a brief monkey humper salute to our friends across the road), and boarded the bus for the ride home.  Two bus stops later - we were back at the pickle - which we circled and then settled in for Mary (Hello dolly (again), Rosalita, Homer to Marge and WW2) and then we were done.
