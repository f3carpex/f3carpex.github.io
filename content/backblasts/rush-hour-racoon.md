Backblast for my VQ, so I guess this is my VBB. As I was reviewing the extensive F3 Exicon for exercises/routines for my VQ, I saw the Racoon Crawl. I knew I had to incorporate that into the Q. So the whole Q was built around doing that exercise. There are a lot of animal crawls, walks, etc. That's for another Q.

It was an honor to lead you men tonight.  Thanks for the support during the workout. After my first post, I knew this was something I wanted to be a part of.  The group workouts, the level of intensity of the workouts, the chatter, was all great.  I'm still looking for a Vet for MaBell. I have been moved by the openness, honesty, and emotional challenges during COT and on Slack.  I rarely respond, but I read. My time will come. Thanks for the support and gentle nudging to challenge me physically, emotionally, and spiritually.  Franklin and Hermes have worn me down and I’ve committed to run the BRR. Calling all Respects, we have room on our team.  
How do you get this Yoast SEO out of the middle of the screen? I need a tutorial from the BB master Hermes.
