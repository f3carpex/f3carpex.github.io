When I posted the twitter pre blast warning of "devastation", I thought it would just be another Twitter scare tactic. Then, when pulling into Dante's 10 minutes before start, no one was around.  I thought to myself, "wow", everyone took that Tweet seriously last night.  All the sudden, here they come.  Two minutes before start time and the whole PAX rolls up as one unit.  It literally went from no one to all 18 in a matter of 1 minute it seemed.  Despite the odd arrival phenomenon, the coin toss went to the good guys, so no devastation, just hard knocks.

## Warm Up

Good mornings

Side Straddle Hops

Mtn Climbers

## The Thang

Indian Run about 1/2 mile over the far parking lot for some wheel of fortune.

_RUN A LAP AFTER EACH EXERCISE_ : Lap was the amphitheater trail for walk in visitors, which was probably 1/8 mile each pass (some uphill)
