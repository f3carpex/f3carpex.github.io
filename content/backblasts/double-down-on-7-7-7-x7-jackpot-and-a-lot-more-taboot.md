AO: Tortoises

Date: 10/2/2019

PAX: **Yogi**, Roasters, Half Back, Meatloaf, **Traffic Cone**, **Ausfarth**, **Ezekiel**, Five Hole, Hotty Toddy (H), **Crimson**, Lawn Dart, Puddles, Rooney, Sega (HH), Wahoo, **Shipper**, PBX, **Intimidator**, Johnny Utah, **Biner**, Go Cart, The Departed, Ashbury (HH), **WWW**

Tortoises is a great AO because it caters to all HIMs. This was high intensity with no 10 count rest. I had a plan coming to the workout but it had to be modified because of the high number; >20 (24 to be exact). I took the same workout and sprinkled some workout dust on it and this is what I concocted.

**Warm-ups:** GM (3 down - 3 up x5) Bonus Burpees x10 for Go Cart arriving late Hamstring stretch feet together Hamstring stretch feet shoulder width apart (l-c-r) Eskimo Merkins CFMs Since I like burpees ... 10 more

QIC/YHC directed the PAX to partner up and identify who will be partner 1 and partner 2. I split them again to have all partner 1s together and partner 2s together for the thang.

**Thang: 7-7-7 x7 rounds** **Partner 1** Pull-ups x7 Sumo squats x7 Flutter kicks x7

**Partner 2** 7 merkins 7 jump squats 7 LBCs

Burpees x10

Mosey to the wall for Australian mountain climbers x10 IC

People’s chair 5 count down the line and then back up

Mosey to flag and circle up with Ausfahrt for Mary.

But first, burpees x10

After 6 Mary exercises, 10 more burpees. To close out the workout, back on 6 for 100s and have a nice day.

**Count-a-**rama**:** 24

**Name-a-**rama**:** Respect (9); mehs (12); Hate (1); Double Hate (2)

**Announcements:** Haven House fundraiser - boxing event (F3 Carpex vs. F3 Raleigh); Crimson will do a clown car for anyone interested in leaving Cary at 1900 hrs. DM Crimson on Slack.

Burgaw Support - if you are interested, hit up Borland from F3 Raleigh. He just needs people to help. Money and supplies are on hand.

The Odyssey is this weekend. 0600 start @ RItter Park (AO SWW); 0545 show time to sign-in.

F3 Carpex Family Picnic; BYOS. $5 for singles, $10 for family.

**Prayers / Praises:** Ezekiel's Mom Mary, who is going in for surgery. Wahoo's recovery from tibia stress fracture. Ausfarht's recovery. Tony's recovery from rotator cuff surgery. Disco Duck's M and MIL.

**BOM:** Wahoo led us out ... THANK YOU Brother.

**NMS:**

6 Man (Ausfarht) - the man continues to drive himself and us to continue to work the body. I'm proud of that HIM. His M continues to push him to get out into the gloom because she understands the meaning of F3 and how important it is to each HIM.

As stated in "Freed to Lead", Tortoises size continues to grow, so we need another limited run AO. I'm working on that.

I had a plan but due to the numbers, I could not do it so I modified it. Always have Plan B in the hip pocket even if you have to make it up as you go. If you Q enough, you can come up with something that works with the crowd.

I continue to be honored to be out there with you HIMs. Great work this morning!!!
