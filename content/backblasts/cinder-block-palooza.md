PAX: Ausfaht, Michelob, WWW

Since being in Alamance plant on a temporary assignment, I was not able to post in the gloom in the mornings. When the opportunity to post in the gloom was on Thanksgiving Day, I took advantage of it.

Ausfaht kept the mission going by being there for the HIMs. I'm so proud of him. He still continues to bring enthusiasm and fire.

QIC/YHC made sure that I made coffee for our fellowship afterwards.

0530 hrs start time, only 3 PAX to enjoy the palooza festivities.

F3-ministravia done. F3 core values done. Pledge our allegiance to our great country.

Slowest of all slowest of a mosey around the pickle all the while doing Sir Fazio, air presses, seal claps, etc.

Thang 1: Cinder Block palooza.

5 exercises x50 reps each (cinder block swings, rows, curls, overhead presses, and tricep extensions OYO. The break is when the pacer gets back from the pickle. Pacer does lunges, backwards walk, lunges.

Thang 2: mosey over to the picnic tables under the canopy for thang 2. 2 sets of bench squats, incline merkins, and dips.

Mosey back to the flag for Mary around the horn.

COR: 3 high intensity men

NOR: Solid Respect

Announcements: Lots of happenings around Cary

NMS: You are never too old to sling cinder blocks.

True HIMs to continue the top grow and accelerate.

It is my honor to work out with you in the gloom. It sets the tone of how the day goes ... AMAZING!!!
