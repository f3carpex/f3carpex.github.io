Aside: Kudos to BRR Team COT on the Quaranteam concept. T-CEPS, even. Driving to #DTP this morning around 5:15, I see one car after another turning in to David Dr Park. "Man, that's a lot of cars for a team of 12", thought I. Found out later that a massive run club meets at Wolverine on Tuesday mornings as well. LOL. So much for social distancing... :) But seriously, great initiative. And probably bringing that team together something fierce.

Second time at DTP for YHC. I think my last visit here I noted how I like urban jungle settings. Not that the Peak of Good Living resembles an urban jungle in any sense of the word but it's sometimes fun to meander the concrete pathways.

**Warm-up:**

Figure out where the rock pile was. Mosey across the street for some standard SSH, Phelps, GM, Sir Fazio, Seal Clap, Laes Clap, MC & Merkins. Somewhere in the 7 to 20 range for each.

Mosey to said rock pile.

**Thang:**

Grab a rock. Humor TrackStar's OCD and get ON the circle people!

Routine consisting of a) thang with rock followed by b) run around the building. The thangs included:

- Curls (50x)
- LBCs (50x)
- Rock Rows (50x)
- American Hammers (50x)
- Tricep extensions (50x)
- Squat Thrusts (25x)

Partner up. #1 lunge walks to return the rock. #2 BTTW. Flip flop.

Some stuff in between.

Mosey back to the flag. AYG down AYG Alley.

**Mary:**

15x of LBC, Left-side Crunches, L/R Heel Touches, Right-side Crunches, H2M, Superman.

**COT:**

15\. I'm forgetting one name. Sorry!

Announcements included blood drive ([https://f3carpex.com/2020/08/27/carpex-blood-drive/](https://f3carpex.com/2020/08/27/carpex-blood-drive/)) and CSAUP.

Prayers for Eileen, Dylan and his family and Wahoo's friend with a burst appendix.

**NMS:**

I have to stay here long enough one of these days to hit up the Beignets.

Seriously -- kudos to the Quaranteam as Hi-Liter named it.

Fun crew today. Enjoyed poking fun at Trackstar's OCD some.

Disregard! I remembered Snooki! I knew it was a name that I did a double take on. Glad it came to me.

Enjoyed moving TrackStar's rock while he was out mosey-ing the building. LOL.
