It rained practically all night, and at 0500 the Steve indicated that Tank Top Tuesday was a real possibility. To that end, an even dozen of Carpex' finest gathered at the flag at Salem Pond Park. Allegiance is pledged and off we go.

### Warm Up

Mosey around the parking lot and then down the main drag to a street light that was actually on. We'll forever refer to that as Mistake #1. On the way, high knees and butt kickers. Circle up for SSHs, Steve Earles, Good Mornings, Moroccan Night Clubs, and Seal Claps

### The Thang

Deconstruct Dora, except we don't partner up yet.

- 25 Standard Merkins
- Run the loop around Salem Pond
- Step in a hole on the way around and twist ankle. Mistake #2
- Limp back to the original warm up circle, complete 25 Standard Merkins
- Limp to the basketball court, complete 50 LBCs
- AMRAP pull-ups
- 50 LBCs
- AMRAP pull-ups
- Partner up, Partner 1 bear crawls the length of the basketball court while Partner 2 is working on 300 squats. Flip flop until complete

Run/limp to the big traffic circle, for a round of 5s with WW Merkins and Star Jumps. Once complete, 6 burpees ON MY DOWN. Run/limp to the flag.

### Mary

Captain Thor, Hello Callahans, Control Freak Merkins

### COT

2 Respects, 10 Mehs

Announcements were announced. Prayer requests continue for Michelob's & Term Paper's daughters. YHC took us out.

### NM(M)S

- Bad idea to run around the lake with no light. That should probably be Mistake #1
- PAX are better looking in the dark (real Mistake #1)
- As other PAX have noted, MC was at TURBO level
- If the Q attempts to finish everything (including COT) within 45 minutes, there will be MC
- Captain Thor normally shuts down MC, but seemed to actually be an accelerator
- GREAT to have McCants back, gettin after it
- Be a little better today than you were yesterday
