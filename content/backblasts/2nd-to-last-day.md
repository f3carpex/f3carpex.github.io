We're almost there!! This was my only second time posting at Point Break (I hung onto the edge of the magic carpet that is running EC with Lookout and then bailed for SNS one other time), but the spot was open this weekend, so the JP as imminent South-Caryite Q tour had an opportunity to continue. Can't pass that up.

Adjacent rolled up at 5:20 (stronnnnnng move by the site Qsee correction\*), followed by 4 others. Here's a pledge and FOLLOW ME!

Around the New Waverly loop past Whole Foods to the west side fountain for a warmup consisting of GM, SSH, SFAC, rSFAC, OC, IW, HB, FOLLOW ME again.

At the bottom of the steps at the boxing gym, partner up for a classic Dora 1-2-3 (\*110%) with the non-exercising partner runs to the top of the steps and does 5 Star Jumps. Halfway through the squats, reverse the polarity and do the Dora exercises at the top of the steps. TP ten-count, and FOLLOW ME.

Over in the TMAC parking lot. P1 bear crawls the small lot and merks at each parking space line while P2 runs to the dumpsters and back. 4 rounds of that. LO ten-count, and FOLLOW ME.

Back over to Advent and then to New Waverly back past the flag to a grassy knoll for clock merkins at 12-3-6-9-12. Back to the flag for Mary including a full minute HAND.

THAT'S IT

COR/NOR - 1 Respect, 5 meh

Announcements - Duck Donut Dash, Friday is the last day for shirts

Prayers/Praises - Disco is back! JP's M's sister had a healthy baby yesterday.

NMS

Real bad math led to the increase of the Dora reps by 10%. Today is day #365 of the year, so I wanted that to show up somewhere. In my quick calcs at 5:20, 110+220+330 equaled 360, which is clearly not true. Should've gone for the +20% instead to get 360 \* 2 (+ the 5 \* 2 star jumps). Oh well.

RIP TMAC.

I no longer regret missing the Maynard today - I'm sniffing participating in some of the Maynard activities on Friday anyways. PLUS the early chatter about MaynarDino merch is getting me PSYCHED.

12/30 definitely sounds like a time, so had to work in the clock merkins today.

I just crushed a bunch of chocolate milk and grape juice while writing this BB, so also RIP my morning.

Thank you all for showing up! 10 Qs in the books for 2020, and that was with the 9-month drought for YHC. I'm def ready to see you more regularly in Carpex in 2021!

Corrections

\*not a site Q, just a regular attender, but a strong showing nonetheless. I promise I meant no disrespect to Augmented

and while we're here - the switch from the bottom of the steps to the top of the steps was due to a lady pulling up to go into the boxing gym. felt like the right move to do some star jumps there vs have a buncha dudes squatting ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
