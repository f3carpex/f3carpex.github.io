YHC did something a bit unusual and decided to Q a Kettle bell workout today. This one required some prep work and I hit the ground at the newest of locations for Hells Bells and was greeted with 24 brave souls. My ride for the day (or really for most days) Nature Boy was a bit delingquent today so Earhart was really sweatting whether or not we would make it. We did - three minutes to spare - no problem.

Quick disclaimer for two guys who became FNG - Johnny Utah and FNG - Face Paint and then we were off (it was quite easy to disclaim the part about being a professional based on my limited KB experience.

A warm up lap - through the apartment complex and then back to the church for warm up - SSH, HB, GM, Abe Vigoda, Windmill (yes - i did call both exercises), SFAC.

Partner up, Grab a bell and then over to the top parking lot. Time for some KB Dora - with 100 upright rows, 200 KB swings and 300 (scratch that - make it 250) KB Squat/ OH press. One partner doing exercises, one running the top pickle - Exercises cumulative - but boy - these did take a long time - and had Crimson whining quite a bit.

Next up - was P1 - walk with KB, P2 - plank hold, flapjack, then P1 - lunge with KB, P2 - squat hold, flapjack - rinse and repeat both.

Time is getting tight so back to the start for some KB - American Hammers (glad to see the 5 pound KB was there for YHC) and then we were done.

Announcements - 9/11 Stair climb, Golf Tournament, Odyssey

Prayers - for Yahoo's upcoming adoption

thanks to each of you for being there and letting me lead.
