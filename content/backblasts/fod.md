YHC rolled into Thomas Brooks park a little early to knock out some EC pull-ups. It's not much of a thing here, but eventually several PAX joined in once they realized that pull-ups can be done at the shelter by the soccer fields. Good news, we'll be back here eventually. With pull-ups done and the time drawing nigh, we joined the PAX circling up in the normal FOD starting spot. One issue - no flag. At 5:44, we FINALLY get a site Q who hurriedly installs said flag. In the meantime, Beaker has darted off into the pine trees for a little "relief". We've barely gotten both Beaker and the flag when the clock strikes, and first exercise is Pledge of Allegiance.

### Warm Up

Mosey over to the lot adjacent to the shelter and circle up for a standard fare of SSHs, Moroccan Night Clubs, Seal claps (for you @Liverpool), Good Mornings (for you @Nature Boy), Steve Earles, Burt Jacks, and Control Freak Merkins. Form 2 lines, Indian Run up to the front lot.

### The Thang

Deconstructed Dora:

- At the front lot, partner up. Partner 1 runs the pickle around the center island while Partner 2 completes 200 jump squats. Flip flop until complete.
- Run back to the warm up lot, completing 5 burpees at alternating street lights.
- Partner 1 completes 50 World's Worst Merkins, while partner 2 runs to the shelter, completes 5 pull-ups, and runs back. Flip flop til complete.
- Run to the basketball court. Partner 1 completes 300 LBCs while partner 2 does an Apple Turnover to the other end of the court and runs back. Flip flop until complete.
- Same thing, except 50 Star Jumps

### Mary

1 round of Captain Thor, Have a Nice Day.

### COT

1 Hate, 4 Respects, 13 Mehs

YHC took us out.

### NMS

- Beaker was thrown off because YHC sold the FJ Cruiser. Be on the lookout for a white Mazda with an F3 sticker on the driver's side rear window.
- Speaking of Beaker - we don't know if he did #1, 2, or both. He wasn't gone long, but long enough to be noticed.
- Franklin has selective hearing. YHC believes this may have served him well over the many years of his life.
- Prodigal excelled at every exercise YHC called this fine morning.
- Bogo is a fine Dora partner and hope to see HIM again soon.
- Kung Pao, a newer PAX, was pretty quiet. YHC remembers when Trike was new and quiet.
- These fine men make me want to be a little bit better every day. SYITG
