12 PAX braved the weather for a 2000's beat-down.  Shakira, Lady Gaga, and Beyonce joined us on the trek though they were not favored by the PAX present.  Nonetheless, YHC truly enjoys workouts better when the tunes are humming!

Jog around the pickle to circle up for Warm-ups.

Warm-ups

Side Straddle Hop, Imperial Walkers, Good Mornings, Merkins, Mountain Climbers

Jog to the baseball field.

Thing 1

Partner up, 3 rounds of one partner either People's Chair or Balls to the Wall the other partner bear crawls to 1st base, lunge to 2nd base, bear crawl to 3rd base, lunge home.

Fellowship run to the picnic shelter where we joined a gentleman enjoying the sunrise and a stinky cigar.  He did not deign to join us in our endeavors.  I do not believe he was impressed.

2 rounds of dips and derkins were followed by 2 rounds of the pairs doing LBC or dying cockroach while partner runs the parking lot loop.

Jog to rock pile 2 sets of rock rows, curls, presses, triceps extensions.  One must say that some of the rock choices were light even for an old man like YHC.

Jog to Mary

American Hammers, Freddy Mercurys, Boat Canoe, HAND

Announcements

Honestly, fatigue, old age, and too much time since it happened has blanked my mind to both the announcements and prayers.  Any help I can get is greatly appreciated.

NMS

Thank you, Oofta, for the coffee and enjoyable conversation after the workout.  It was greatly appreciated.
