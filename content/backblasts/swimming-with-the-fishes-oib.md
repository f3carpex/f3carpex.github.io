Half, Kitty and YHC....2 of CarPex's finest and YHC met at the OIB Fishing Pier for a Sarday morning workout.  Overcast, low 70's, nice wind out of the west.   OIB is a southern facing beach so with wind out of the west we the men had it in their face for a good bit of our running.

After exchanging pleasantries in the parking lot...we grabbed Kitty''s awesome '76 shovel flag and jogged over to the beach.

Flag was planted.   No disclaimer.  And we were off.  We all took turns calling the workout excercises which was fun.
