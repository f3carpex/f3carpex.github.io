Hit the PAX with a challenge to post at Kryptonite on the Slacks. And a special request to the 8 other Pax that attended my first workout, 7 of the 8 were there (Burt - Q, Wonderbread, Denali, Hotspot, Michelob, Franklin, and MaBell). Surcharge was unable to make it, although I am not sure he received my request. Anyways, 27 total showed up to see if I learned anything in the past 5 years..............let see.

Warm-up: Run to the Dude parking lot for 20 SSH, 5 GMs, 15 PJs, 10 IWs, 15 Mtn Climbers, and 20 merkins -------- all in perfect cadence!

Thang 1- Partner up. Run around the parking lot opposite direction, doing 10 hand release merkins each time you meet. Meet 6 times for a total of 60 (months in 5 years). On to the next lot, same thing but 10 squats, total up to 60 squats.

Thang 2 - Over the Half Hill for a set of 5's. Burpees and world-worst merkins.

Thang 3 - Take your partner and join another set for a Catch Us If You Can. 5 merkins, catch the group indian run style back to the warm up parking lot. Then fellowship run to the shovel flag (which laid broken in Denali's trunk).

Mary - 20 LBCs, 20 Freddy Mercs.

COT - 27 PAX, Announcements about Oakwood 24 and continued efforts in Burgaw. Prayers for Kingsley and Adrian as they go through cancer treatments and surgery, Prayers for "Mike" a youth in OM's troop who needs some help. YHC took us out.

NMS - I reflected during COT on my 5 years and what being in F3 has meant to me. Morning workouts are often the highlight of my day. I have made some of my best friendships in this awesome group of men. I have grown as a person, as a father, as a husband and as a Christian as a result of being around you guys. I think about those men that need F3 in their lives, and encouraged everyone, myself included, to be more evangelical. I am so thankful to be a part of this F3 brotherhood! I look forward to the next 5 years!
