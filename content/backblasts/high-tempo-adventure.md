Cougartown 5/11

**PAX**: Snooki, Traffic Cone, Sooey, Crimson, Puddles, Peaches, Bolton, The Joker, Intimidator

**QIC**: Flenderson

YHC noticed the empty Q slot yesterday and felt F2L. When this AO opened I realized how close it was to the nearby field and to Walmart just beyond it. This was a lofty plan but could be the push YHC needs.

Mosey to lot near tennis court for warm up.

**Warm Up:**

Arm Circles

Seal Clap

Good Morning(thatâ€™s singular)

Mosey to Rex Rehab half way to Walmart

Circle up for exercises determined by the workout die.

Mosey to Walmart

Circle up for exercises determined by the workout die.

Run around Walmart and repeat

Mosey back to the AO

This is where this went array. A group of slower PAX left early to get a head start lead by Site Q. YHC went back the way we came and 2 faster PAX took a slightly longer route. YHC ended up at the AO as our time expired and immediately noticed 4 PAX were missing. It turns out said Site Q decided to take a "short cut" that ended up being longer and with a much bigger hill.

Fearing they took a wrong turn a few PAX mosey back into the neighborhood to search before seeing them on their return.

With all PAX accounted for we ended with COT.
