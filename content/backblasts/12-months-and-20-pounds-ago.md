So 1 year of working out, I have not been active as much as I like, but I have stuck with it, making this the longest I have stick with a working on since probably high school. In 1 year its amazing how much we have grown, and how much I have grown. Thank you to everyone who keeps encouraging me and not leaving me behind, and certainly not where you found me.
