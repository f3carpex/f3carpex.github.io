The call went out the night before for an EC run at 0500 and the following HIM showed up: Michelob, Chanticleer, Largemouth, Snots, Sub and YHC.

Four miles later and with just 1 minute to spare before the bell rang at 0530, YHC asked for FNGs, heard no response and Moseyed to the other side of the school.

On the way we enjoyed some High Knees, Butt Kickers and Karaoke.

Dutch Skate to the hill (FYI...My form was compared to some of the greatest figure and speed skaters of all time. No offense was taken.)

YHC took us out with excerpts of the poem "What Will Matter" by Micheal Josephson. Below is the entire poem.

> _Ready or not, some day it will all come to an end._
> 
> _There will be no more sunrises, no minutes, hours, or days._
> 
> _All the things you collected, whether treasured or forgotten, will pass to someone else._
> 
> _Your wealth, fame, and temporal power will shrivel to irrelevance._
> 
> _It will not matter what you owned or what you were owed._
> 
> _Your grudges, resentments, frustrations, and jealousies will finally disappear._
> 
> _So, too, your hopes, ambitions, plans, and to-do lists will expire._
> 
> _The wins and losses that once seemed so important will fade away._
> 
> _It won’t matter where you came from or what side of the tracks you lived on at the end._
> 
> _It won’t matter whether you were beautiful or brilliant._
> 
> _Even your gender and skin color will be irrelevant._
> 
> _So what will matter? How will the value of your days be measured?_  
> _What will matter is not what you bought but what you built; not what you got but what you gave._
> 
> _What will matter is not your success but your significance._
> 
> _What will matter is not what you learned but what you taught._
> 
> _What will matter is every act of integrity, compassion, courage,_
> 
> _or sacrifice that enriched, empowered, or encouraged others to emulate your example._
> 
> _What will matter is not your competence but your character._
> 
> _What will matter is not how many people you knew but how many will feel a lasting loss when you’re gone._
> 
> _What will matter is not your memories but the memories of those who loved you._
> 
> _What will matter is how long you will be remembered, by whom, and for what._
> 
> _Living a life that matters doesn’t happen by accident._
> 
> _It’s not a matter of circumstance but of choice._
> 
> _Choose to live a life that matters._
