Q School 101 at Lion's Den - a site YHC and The Most Sour of all Mashes started just a few years ago. Starts off great, give the disclaimer, no FNGs, and explain that we're doing the Pledge but it is not a required element of a proper Q.

## Warm Up

Mosey to the entrance to the church, and explain why it is important to understand the layout and features of a site you are Q'ing. For this site, this warm up spot is not to be missed. Best in all of Carpex. Circle up for some exercises which feature both a Cadence and a Up/Down count. YHC starts with SSHs, then calls other exercises and allows PAX to practice counting.

## Thang 1

Mosey to the parking lot nearest the school. Explain to the PAX it is important to also choose a route and exercise routing that not only allows PAX to push themselves, but also to keep up with everyone and PUT6 when necessary. We are going to do 11s, together, across this parking area. At the bottom, merkins. At the top, Steve Earles. And the Q will call different modes of transportation across the parking lot, which include bear crawl, crawl bear, crab walk, walk crab, lunge walks, as well as the standard mosey. PAX take turns calling the exercise counts. During this, we discuss the F3 mission:

To plant, grow and serve small workout groups for men, for the invigoration of male community leadership.

We also discuss and repeat the 5 core principles of F3:

- Always free of charge
- Open to all men
- Always outside, rain or shine
- Peer led
- Always ends in a Circle of Trust

The Mission and Core Principles are repeated throughout the rest of the workout.

## Thang 2

Mosey back to the flag. We use this parking lot to do Pearls on a String, allowing PAX to call exercises at all 4 corners as we mosey around the lot. This is another way to ensure we keep PAX close and all paces can be accomodated.

## Mary

Around the horn, allowing PAX to call their favorite Mary. Q takes charge at the end for 10 Control Freak Merkins. Men want to be led, and want the workouts to be challenging.

## COT

Here's where the Q falls apart. In an effort to ensure we get all Culture Month announcements, as well as present one lucky PAX with a copy of Freed to Lead, we almost pray before Count-a-rama and Name-o-rama. Quick catch by the Q to correct and YHC takes us out. 13 PAX with a couple of old dudes like YHC.

## NMS

- Experienced Qs make counting sound easy, but it's not
- When you make a mistake, keep moving
- Men will follow if you lead
- Smithers and Honeycomb are still really good at bear crawling
- MIAGD!
