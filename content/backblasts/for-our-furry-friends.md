It was good to be back at Lion's Den and see all the guys I see at other times during the week, just at a different location. Seriously, this AO means a lot to me and I'm glad to see it is thriving under @Ramsey and @Slim Shady's leadership.

For this workout I wanted to recognize those furry friends in our lives that give us comfort, entertainment and unconditional love. Make sure to give your pet a hug today, unless it is gross, like a fish or reptile. There are a lot of exercises named after animals, but the PAX seemed grumpy after the first thang, so I moved on after a few minutes.
