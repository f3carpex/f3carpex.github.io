We ended today's COT with Pivot saying something profound about a blossom. But I can't for the life of me remember what it was. It was something like "even if you can't flower, you can smell the blossom". I know that's not it but it was something like that. Or maybe it wasn't. But it definitely had the word "blossom" in the quote. Probably.

Today's Measure Twice was something like a Measure Thrice.

**Measure the First:**

Ran the big block counter-clockwise. Fast guys directed to circle back and PUT6 at each corner.

We got ~3.4 miles. It was humid. Very very humid.

**Measure the Second:**

While waiting for the six to come it (they took a detour), five of us got to getting in a bit of EC Mary. 40 IC LBCs, 20 each side oblique crunches, 20 IC FKs and 50 IC FMs.

**Measure the Third:**

Everyone is in and accounted for. Yoga today was focused on hamstrings and back. Mostly because of the 45 miles cycle ride we did this weekend and my back was definitely feeling it. Good times.

Interesting observation that may only be interesting to me: the high HR for yoga came during the runner's stretch with one arm up. HR's across the board jumped ~20%. Interesting.

**COT:**

- 7 PAX, including 2 Respects
- Announcements: Crema coffee to follow
- Prayers / Praisers: a bit of a two-fer as we asked for both for the end of the 2020/21 school year. May we never see another like it again.

**NMS:**

- Nothing major today. It was a good crew this morning. Enjoyed catching up about Torpedo's UT trip and hearing about the good times the dads and kids had on the outing this weekend
- Remember when you could still catch a shooting start during yoga at Measure Twice? Not any more!
- Good to run into Swag this morning. Pickle balling with some neighbors at 630AM. Nice work! He gets an honorary tag.
