## _disruption_

_the act or process of [disrupting](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/disrupt) something **:** a break or interruption in the normal course or continuation of some activity, process, etc._

There were 20 dudes who were at the AO known as Bounty Hunters, by the time it ended. Some of them were doing a run, others did the Main Event. YHC didn't have a count of exactly who was doing what. And this backblast really won't focus on that little detail. The reason YHC writes a backblast is to document what happened. At least what happened according to one perspective. There is no backblast for the first time I ever posted - want to make sure I do my part to keep that from happening to our good friend Daniel, AKA Rock Lobster. Daniel made the choice to check out F3 for the first time on this date, and YHC thinks it was the right choice.

Another reason for this backblast is to make sure any assumptions are corrected (or confirmed) regarding exactly what happened right here, on February 13, 2020.

Disclaimer was read, and the mission of F3 was recited.

First exercise, Pledge of Allegiance.

## Warm Up

- SSHs
- Frisco shows up
- Frisco is invited into the circle to suck his thumb and finish his donut whilst the PAX complete 10 burpees
- Sir Fazio forward and back
- Steve Earles
- CF Merkins
- Smokey leads the group in Good Mornings

## Thang 1

Mosey to adjacent parking lot for a secret but not so secret quick meet up with the FiA ladies. Put on Love Shack by the B-52s - each time they sing "Love Shack", do a burpee. If you were wondering, it's exactly 40 times. In between Q leads the group in running in place, air presses and SSHs.

Once complete continue the playlist of songs with Love in the title. Partner up for a quick mini-DORA: 100 merkins, 100 squats, 100 LBCs, while the other person runs the pickle.

Pause for a quick picture - there's your 10 count.

## Thang 2

Leaving the FiA ladies to their own thang, partner up for 2 rounds of Catch Me If You Can around the big pickle. First round, the exercise is Dying Cockroaches. When you meet up with your partner, complete 5 partner clap merkins. Second round, the exercise is 5 burpos and you complete 5 Peter Parker Merkins when you reach your partner.

Take another mosey around the pickle and enter the unlocked soccer field.

## COT

20 PAX, including a few who met us there after a long run. Some Respects and one Hate.

Welcome FNG Rock Lobster.

Orphan is leading a team down to Burgaw in March for the continued rebuild. Please hit him up if you can join. Tomorrow is Valentine's Day; however, we should be mindful of our relationships EVERY DAY! Especially with that Most Important Relationship.

YHC took us out.

## NMS

- Too many sleeves on #TTT and 60 something degrees. Tighten Up!
- Biner is strong in the name game. Love Shack would have been an OK name, but Rock Lobster is another level.
- TClaps for the FiA ladies having a great sense of humor and embracing the burpee. One of the ladies (don't know her) was pretty well along in her pregnancy, and she was out there getting stronger. Happy to support their efforts.
- There's another Daniel out there who needs an F3 name. He might be connected with someone we came into contact with today. Let's all be mindful of that - lots of guys need this. Or, I've got a free trial to Orange Theory I got at the Krispy Kreme packet pickup.
- Get After It! Be better today.
