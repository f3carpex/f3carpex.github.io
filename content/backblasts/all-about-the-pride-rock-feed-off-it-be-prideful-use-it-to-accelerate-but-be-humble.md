It is amazing to have two 2.0s out this morning. Richie Rich EH’d his 1.0 CK to go workout. Great on you Richie!

Also out was Half Pike, Sputnik’s 2.0. These boys killed it.

Pride was the theme. Quote: Pride is a personal commitment. It is an attitude which separates excellence from mediocrity. Author Unknown.
