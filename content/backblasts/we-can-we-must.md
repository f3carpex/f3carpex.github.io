I've done quite a few overnight ruck events. More than most, not as many as some. Each one has been different in its challenges and lessons. With that in mind, it was with great curiosity that I shadowed the D-Day Tough event in Sanford, NC June 5-6, 2020.

Yes, 2020. The year of the pandemic. Of unanticipated challenges and lessons. Of unforeseen modifications. Of uncertainty and trepidation. What would all this mean for the ruck event? How could it even be possible? Should it even be attempted?

The event was certainly different from my expectations. The standard complement of heavy stuff was replaced with individual weight. The pace of the ruck was faster. The PT sessions more rigorous than often seen at the 12-hour event.

What didn't change? Dan gave us all a fantastic history lesson on D-Day. He told how brave men faced long odds and grueling conditions to fight for what they believed. He shared how even a general stormed the beach, armed with a cane. He told how "Rangers led the way" among less-experienced volunteers. The team listened. They learned.

Then, they worked. The lessons told in stories were reinforced with hard work. Every man and woman on the team felt at least a small piece of what it's like to push yourself to do more than you think is possible.

At the end of my time with the team, I was gratified, and I was relieved. We can still do hard things. In fact, if we want to continue to learn how to be better friends, better neighbors, better leaders -- we must.
