While perusing our beautiful Q-sheet, looking for a spot to q and remembered I had never Q'd FMJ and there was an open spot and you get a koozie. I mean when stars align you go with it, even if you don't have a theme ready to go.

Everyone gathered in the parking lot, trying to stay away from the problematic traffic coming in. Disclaimer for the Pax/FNGs and we're off. Brisk mosey to the road and head northwest to the other school entrance. Circle up for warm-ups.

- Side Straddle Hops
- Mountain Climbers
- Apparently slow cadence Hill Billies
- Good Mornings

On to the things...

- Thing 1 - 7s with a loop...run down the parking lot, lunge walk the loop, then Wolverines, up the parking lot to the top of the grassy hill for jump squats.
- Side note...32 people get spread out a lot
- Thing 2 - nice traditional Dora 123 (Merkins, Squats, LBCs)
- Mosey back to the base, but zig zag through any and all visible poles, columns, and cones
- Have a nice day with some guided meditative breathing

Welcome FNGs Crash and GLOW. (did you know that the q can change a name within 30 seconds if a better one pops in his head)

Always a pleasure to share the gloom with this group!
