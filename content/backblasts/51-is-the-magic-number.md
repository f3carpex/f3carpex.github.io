There's an ongoing Slack-o-sphere "discussion" over the #1 AO in all of Carpex.  I'll admit, YHC has stirred the pot just a bit over this one.  The primary goal for the February 9, 2018 edition of Dante's Peak was to show the glorious versatility and overall excellence of what I consider to be THE top destination for PAX of Carpex.

So let's get on with it.

Solid group of HIMs (HIDAs?) had gathered in the parking lot of Apex Nature Park at the appointed time of 5:45 in the AM.  Including a small but mighty rucking group.  We mosey on to the basketball court to get loose.  On the way, throw in some butt-kickers, high knees, and side shuffles.

**WARM UP**

SSH x 51.  More on this later

10 Burpees OYO (Disco Duck tribute)

Cotton Pickers, Hill Billies, Sir Fazios front and back, and overhead claps

**PRE THANG 1**

Or a kind of transition from warm up.  Since we're on the basketball court, we partner up for a quick round of partner 1 BTTW, partner 2 suicide, then flip flop.  Once this is done, we Indian run over to the back parking lot.

WAIT...10 more burpees OYO at the gate. Mumble chatter is increasing.  Now we can head over to...

**THANG 1**

Paint the lines.  Grab a line, jog up, backpedal across, hand release Merkin (Nan'tan tribute) at the top of each line.  Apparently for about half the PAX in attendance, clockwise is the opposite of what I'm used to.  Confusion ensues, YHC calls 10 more burpees before we head to...

**THANG 2**

Mosey down to the pond, get your partner and pick a non-traveling rock to share.  DORA 123s: Curls, Bent Rows, and Squats.  We need more back and bicep work boys, to balance it out.  There was a lot of rock-swapping when the PAX discovered just how many curls they needed to do.  Audible called as time is running short.  We start the mosey back to the front parking lot, but of course Bear Crawls across the bridge are necessary.  At this point YHC is concerned about a mutiny, but figure it's too late for anything really bad to happen.  Get back to the parking lot, we knock out more burpees before...

**MARY**

Ruckers have rejoined the group, and we have PAX choice of various Mary exercises.  Just enough time to knock out 1 more burpee for good measure.  Monkey Nut looks like he's seen a ghost.

**COT**

**Count-o-rama: 19**

**Name-o-rama:** 3 respects, 0 hates, 16 mehs

**Announcements:** Some PAX are doing some stuff, they claim it's 7.5 miles but its really 12.  Shut-In is hosting a Beer/BBQ event on 2/28 I think.  The rumor is that Riptide is doing the BBQ and it's decent.  YHC was tired at this point and that's about all I heard.

**Prayer Requests:** Sooey's co-worker is having surgery, Chappy has a neighbor who passed unexpectedly.  Earhart has a co-worker who is dealing with leukemia.  Disco Duck's M still dealing with pain, tests have ruled out some serious concerns but they still don't know what is causing this.

**NMS**

YHC set out to show the versatility of this site, and 45 minutes only allows touching the surface.  Great AO!

Prior to last night's game, the UNC - dook series was tied 50-50 in the last 100 contests.  Overall point spread was 2 points.  That tie was broken, GDTBTH!  Hence the 51.  The PAX seemed to lose the SSH count on the way to 51, but pretty sure I still heard Freebird with the count.  Yes, I saw some of the PAX bent over after the SSH, so I went with a 10 count as I knew what they had coming next.

Don't take you life, fitness, family, friends or your faith and mission for granted.  We aren't guaranteed the next minute, so make it count.  Make it a point to positively impact at least one person TODAY.  YHC was honored and humbled to lead you men today.
