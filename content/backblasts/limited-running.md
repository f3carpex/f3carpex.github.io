The Hi-Literversary Week and the Disco Duck Birthday Week overlapped, giving two brothers an opportunity to co-Q Phoenix, the greatest Saturday AO in all of Carpex. Because some of the PAX were running in the Break the Silence 5K later in the morning, we decided today's workout would be limited running. Disco takes the first half, Hi-Liter takes the second.

**Warm-Up**

Mosey down to the Parking Lot of Pain and circle up for side straddle hops x 10, imperial walkers x 10, Sir Fazio forward x 10, Sir Fazio backward x 10 and warm up burpees x 7.

**The Thang**

Mosey over to rock pile and find an ego rock and circle up for tricep extensions x 10, overhead press x 10, curls x 10, rock rows x 10 and rock squats x 7.

Bear crawl over to the shelter and grab some bench for dips x 10, ALRSUs x 10, irkins x 10, teabaggers x 10 and derkins x 7. Repeato.

Mosey up the hill to the community center parking lot, with five star jumps at the odd light poles and ten LBCs at the even light poles.

Hand off from Disco Duck to Hi-Liter.

Mosey down to the kiosk for hill sprints x 8 with squats at the top.

Make our way down to the stop sign by alternating at each light pole between eight count bear crawls with a burpee and eight count lunge walks with a Bobby Hurley.

Indian run back to the flag.

**Mary**

Circle up for boat-canoe, Homer-to-Marge, imperial walkers, cool down burpees and have a nice day.

**COT**

**Count-a-rama**:  25 (15 boot camp, 10 ruck) **Name-a-rama**:  6 RESPECTs, 19 meh, 0 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for Saban and the family of his friend Brian Champ who passed away last night **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**

The rock pile next to the Parking Lot of Pain is all ego rocks. Not a single travelling rock to be found.

Lotta bitching from the PAX this morning, mostly during the Hi-Liter half. Good job, bro!

We promised limited running and we delivered. Running was limited to eight sprints up the hill next to the kiosk. It sucked at the time, but for an hour long workout that ain't much.

If you're keeping score at home, Hello Kitty and YHC made all of our shots during the Bobby Hurleys.

I enjoyed sharing the Q with Hi-Liter. His flavor of crazy and my flavor of crazy go together well. I think you'll see more of that in the future.

Thanks for letting us lead.
