Back to flag. Pax led assorted hamstrung and glute stretches.

COT. Prayers for Hamm's sister and baby delivery today, for the country and that we all listen with reason, open heart, love, and humility. YHC took us out.

I read this poem for the first time today. Maybe we should read this to remind ourselves that many still have hope for and continue to seek the American Dream: [https://poets.org/poem/let-america-be-america-again](https://poets.org/poem/let-america-be-america-again)
