Despite the bitter cold, and the bitter taste of defeat (great game, Hokies), YHC headed to Hot for Teacher where eight men gathered for another day of some good 'ole vanilla.

Warmup: A couple laps around a very nice pickle, merkins, mountain climbers, imperial walkers, good mornings

Thang: Dora (burpees, squats, LBC), hillbarrows, Mary

Another twitter-worthy recap. YHC out.
