With the weather being a pleasant 48f this AM, 17 of Carpex’s finest came out in the gloom. Some appeared eager and did an EC, others didn’t. I am not one to judge, rather my purpose this morning was to Q.   Let’s do this. Starting with:

Pledge of allegiance

Mozy to parking lot for warmups consisting of: 

- Good mornings
- Seal claps
- Overhead claps
- Sir fazio arm circles
- Side stradle hops

Mozy to top of trail path 

**Thang 1: 7’s** 

- Plank Jacks & Sumo Squats

Mozy past lake to parking lot

**Thang 2: Partner up for DORA / Partner run pickle** 

- 100 - merkins
- 200 - mountain climber
- 300 - LBCs

**Mozy to shelter for 2 rounds of table**

- Dips
- Derkins

**Mozy to starting parking lot for Mary** 

- American Hammers
- Low Slow Flutter (Duece)
- Dying Cockroach (Water Wings)
- Boat Canoe

**Have a nice day.**

COT: I mentioned it being my moms 76th birthday today. I made the request that if possible, y’all should call your mom.

Let it be known that mumble chatter was solid, and a mention of decent mileage was announced. Additionally, the 50 American Hammers had some questioning my age, traveling to SoCal and visiting dispensaries/pharmacists.   
  
Bootlegger took us out in prayer.
