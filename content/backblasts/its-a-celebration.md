BIG. DAY. IN. CARPEX!

37 HIMs of all ages, including one FNG gathered at Apex's finest Friday AO. YHC and WWW have the Q for what was anticipated to be a large, raucous crowd BEGGING for a beatdown. F3's mission is recited, disclaimer is exclaimed, and allegiance is pledged. Mosey to the big circle for...

### Warm Up

Good mornings, SSHs, Calf Stretches, A few sets of merkins, plank jacks and Steve Earles. Split into 2 groups by numbering off 1-2.

Each group does each THANG once

### Thang Red Ryder

One group moseys toward the pull-up bars. Bear crawl the bridge, and once all the PAX have arrived we go for 5 sets of Pull-up runs. UP TO 5 pull-ups per set, followed by 1 lap around the pond. LBCs for the six until finished. Mosey back to the bridge, which we bear crawl again, and meet up on the athletic field.

### Thang WWW

No, that's not beer in the cooler. It WAS something that would generate a lot of fun (get your mind out of the gutter). It was everything needed for ultimate frisbee.

The rules:

If the disc is dropped, closest PAX calls their favorite exercise and leads it. If a touchdown is scored, the scoring team does 10 merkins and the team scored upon does 10 Wolverine burpees.

Once each group has had a turn, circle up on the field for:

### Mary

Boat canoe, 6 celebration burpees, Squatter 100s, Have a Nice Day

### COT

- 37 is a lot, we had several respects and several Hates
- Welcome FNG Friar Tuck!
- Things were announced, there were several prayer requests and WWW took us out.

### NMS

- WWW learned from a recent Ultimate game at Lion's Den and split the PAX up based on speed, and kept the games a lot closer.
- The second group only had time for 4 reps of pull-up runs; everyone got a thorough beat down.
- Apex is going to have to add more of those little black rubber turf balls after seeing how many Friar Tuck left with today (stuck to his bare skin).
- WWW called more burpees than YHC. Well done sir.
- A big THANK YOU to Ma Bell for your leadership. Carpex is truly BLOTTING OUT THE SUN, and you have played a healthy role in that.
- Welcome to the Nantannery Shut-In! MCGA!!!
- Make it a great weekend boys! Be a little better today than you were yesterday.
