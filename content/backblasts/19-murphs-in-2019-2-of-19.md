**Pre-Blast**

- 17 HIM for the second of 19 Murphs (in 2019) at FOD.
- YHC feels so inspired and encouraged by men who would make their way out on a freezing cold morning to grow stronger together. After YHC3 blasted this work out, everyman knew what they were coming out for: **Stronger backs, stronger hearts in 2019.**
- Awesome!

**The Warmup**

- Pledge of Allegiance at flag.

- Run to the shelter, circle up for a few GMs, SSH, Merkins.

****T**he T**hang****

- Do a Murph (run to the top of the baseball field parking lot and back to the shelter for the mile).
- Run back to the flag, 35 box cutters.
- Stretch.

**COT**
