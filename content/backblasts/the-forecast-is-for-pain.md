Five HIM gathered in the hustle and bustle that is Rush Hour for 45 minutes of sweat & fellowship.

**Warm Up**

Mosey from the flag to the circle across from Ashworth's.  Along the way we paint some lines.  Once there, we complete the requisite reps of SSHs, Hill Billies, Cotton Pickers, Sir Fazio both ways, Plank Jacks, and then 10 Merkins on YHC's down and up.

**The Thang**

Mosey back past the flag to the parking deck.  Along the way, we paint the same lines but with Bear Crawls and Merkins.  Each PAX retrieves a pain stick of his choosing.  Circle up beside the deck for sets of 10 of:

- Curls
- Overhead press
- Rows

Then we go up the stairs to the top of the parking deck for 10 Dying Cock-a-roaches.  Back down the stairs for set of 9 this time, and repeato.  We made it through 5, then finished off with a burn set of 10 more curls, presses and rows.

**Pre Mary mini-Thang**

After returning the pain sticks, mosey back to the flag.  Complete 10 wall jump burpees OYO.

**Mary**

PAX choice of mary exercises.  We finish with WWIIs and shoulder tap Merkins, putting on a show for the BB run club crowd.

**COT**

1 Respect, 1 Hate, 3 Mehs

Announcements: June 20 convergence, rumors of a July 4th convergence, a not on June 12th but July 12th Flacco MidsummerF3st 2nd F opportunity.

Prayer requests: Disco's M dealing with anxiety, Jiggly's M having some postpartum issues as well.  Ryder's daughter heading to Governor's school this weekend.  Trust in God to follow His leading.

YHC took us out.

**NMS**

Some observations:

- Dice showed up on the right day as an FNG to get the name Dice. Plus he rides a Harley.  Doesn't like to run much though.
- Disco has picked a favorite pain stick, and set it in a special place so that he can get it again.  We all took runs doing a set.
- Bond Brothers is a very short stroll from this AO, but wear good shoes for the trip.
- Wall jump burpees were introduced to YHC in Asheville.  They're a lot tougher when wearing the breathtaker.  Tough no less, a good finish to a good workout.
- YHC lost count a couple times on the pain stick sets.  We may have done a couple extra reps.
- This is the second time I've posted at Rush Hour.  It's an excellent option for those wanting an evening workout.  Both times Hello Kitty did a drive through and didn't stop.

As always, a pleasure to lead.  Brighten someone's day and be just a little better than you were yesterday.
