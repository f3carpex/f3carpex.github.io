After my plane landed in North Cary, I met Chanticleer for 4 mile EC run. When we finished, we heard the EC pull-up crowd wrapping up, and then the rest of the PAX trickled in. No FNGs, and off we went.

A mosey around the pickle and circle up.

**Warm-Up** Good Mornings, Windmill, Sir Fazio Arm Circles, Seal Clap, Overhead Clap, SSH, Steve Earle

Mosey over to the basketball court.

**Thang 1** Lt. Danger - The length of the basketball court and back, left leg lunge, right leg lung, squat, merkin (repeat)

Mosey around the pickle and into the gloomiest of gloom and end up in the shelter.

**Thang 2** Partner up - P1 runs around the trail leading back to the shelter while P2 does an exercise then flip flop until team completes 100 merkins; 200 step ups; 300 dips

Mosey back to the parking lot

**Thang 3** Due to the time, we did a condensed version of Uptown 50. Starting at one end of the parking lot Partners complete 5 bropees, then bear crawl to half way point. Complete 5 bropees then duck walk to far end. Complete 5 bropees and leap frog w/ your partner back to the half way point. You guessed it, 5 bropees then partner carry back to the beginning. Now you got it... 5 more bropees the flip flop the partner carry to the flag.

**Mary** Low Slow Flutter, Crunchy Frog, 100s

**NMS** - It's always great to see such a mix of different things going on at one AO. There's always something for everyone, and someone there to support you. - Chanticleer is fast and even though he's wearing a watch, he obviously doesn't know how to use it because he never really knows how fast he's running. But I do and I don't like it. No sir, I don't like it one bit. - North Cary Park is great, lots of places to go and possible things to do, but you just can't see anything. - On a personal note, all I have left for the Leadership Challenge is to post and Q at both Rush Hour and Bradford's Ordinary.

Liverpool took us out and YHC shared this quote from Theodore Roosevelt

> “We do not admire the man of timid peace. We admire the man who embodies victorious effort; the man who never wrongs his neighbor, who is prompt to help a friend, but who has those virile qualities necessary to win in the stern strife of actual life.”
