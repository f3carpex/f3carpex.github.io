**Mary** One more round of LBCs then Have A Nice Day.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  11 **Name-a-rama**:  5 RESPECT, 6 meh, 0 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for YHC's M and MIL, praises for Bedpan getting back out in the gloom, praises for Pickles 2.0 birthday **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS** One of the things I'm looking forward to in 2020 is the Iron Pax Challenge, so today was a modified version of Meatloaf's Massacre from Week 2 of the 2019 IPC. I wanted to call it 40 Minutes of Hell, but we didn't use cinder blocks. Maybe next time.

Frisco did our accounting, by his calculations Biner and Chanticleer finished 20 rounds, the rest of us finished 19. Sounds right to me.

Thanks for coming out, letting me lead, and pushing me to be better.
