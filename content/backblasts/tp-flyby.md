Today was really all about the warm up. And the fly-by. But more on that one bit later. First the warm-up.

Rolled into Cornerstone church several minutes early and took a run over to the cemetery for some hill. Singular. Back just in time to grab the speaker, turn on some NIN radio, and greet the crew.

No FNGs. Two FNG2M. Never met them before. Glad to know Jeter and Charmin.

**Warm-up:**

- Pledge
- Pickle
- Grab some cinder blocks. Started to tell the PAX to grab a few extra... but decided to wait.

Warm up set went something like this:

- 20 IC SSH + 1 burpee
- 20 Sir Fazio's + 2 burpees
- 20 Hillbillies + 3 burpees
- 20 IC overhead clamps + 4 burpees
- IW + 5 burpees
- 20 IC squats + 6 burpees
- 20 IC plank jacks + 7 burpees
- 40 merkins + 5 penalty burpees

**Thang**

Pick up the cinderblocks. Set goes like this:

- 25 curls + 20 rock rows + 15 overhead presses + 10 tricep extensions + 5 blockees

We did four sets with lots of squat bounces in between.

Somewhere in between set one and two Term Paper and what looked like a platoon flew by. I took the BH'ers and TP did something with the T2I crowd.

It was a bit of a mess. The BH's split into groups of 3 for curls and partner merkins in rotation. The numbers got all screwed up and it turns out 20 partner merkins add up quick. We did some partner squats as well but that was only slightly less problematic. Thankfully the BHers left quickly. :)

Finished up our set.

**Mary**

- 20 IC block American Hammers
- 20 IC block Flutter kicks
- 40 IC LBCs
- 20 side crunches (each side)
- 20 IC FM

**COT:**

- 12 total with the Respects outnumbering the Meh's
- Announcement: TCP and Tang's lawn. I forgot to make the Juneteenth announcement though. Sorry!
- Prayers for McCants and all the guys on IR

**NMS:**

Thanks for the company. Music was just right.
