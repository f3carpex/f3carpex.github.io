YHC has most recently led workouts that numbered three and four people, respectively.  So I am not mentally prepared for the mass of humanity that descends on DTP this Tuesday morning.  People keep pouring out of cars like Decal is handing out money or has an extra supply of gasoline.  We need a slight change of plans to handle the crowd, but the show will go on.  No FNGs.  Pledge.  Mosey.  Circle up in the church parking lot on West Chatham for a warm up.

- 5 GM IC
- 25 SSH IC
- 15 Imperial Walkers IC
- 15 Sir Fazio IC
- Calf Stretch
- 15 Merkins OMD
- Calf Stretch
- 15 Merkins OMD
- Runners Stretch

Mosey to the base of West Moore Street aka Cemetary Hill aka Lookout Mountain.  The last aka is due to the fact that YHC performed a concrete face plant on this spot during the AO launch and christened DTP with its first blood sacrifice.  We will commemorate that event with 7s on the hill.  World's Worst Merkins at the bottom.  Burpees at the top.  

LSF IC as we wait for everyone to finish up.  Mosey over to the adjoining playground and form up in groups of 3 for rotating exercises.      

- Round 1 - AMRAP Dips, AMRAP Merkins, Crawl Bear up the hill
- Round 2 - AMRAP Step Ups, AMRAP Prisoner Squats, Crawl Bear up the hill
- Round 3 - AMRAP LSF, AMRAP Luge, Crawl Bear up the hill

Mosey back to the flag and circle up for Mary:

- 20 WW2s OMU
- 20 Freddy Mercurys IC
- 20 Heels To Heaven IC
- 20 H2M IC
- Chilcutt

Chain Gang is coming - BOLO.  Meal train for McCants.  Continued prayers for Yahoo and family.  YHC took us out.
