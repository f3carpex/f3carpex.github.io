Phoenix, January 5, 2019

Pax:  1-4, Angry Elf, Banjo, Bluewater, Callahan, Clementine, Earhart, Everready, Frisco, Gap Year, Hello Kitty, Hermès, Jiggly Puff, Lite Brite, Ninjago, Ollie, Pierogi, Pigeon, Pivot, Smokey, Snots, Term Paper, Texas Ranger, Theismann, Traffic Cone, Water Wings, Yoga Mat 

Today was to be Karma Chamelion's virgin Q, Karma has busted his knee and will be out indefinitely.

Prior to starting, YHC invited all pax to consider joining in on the Healing Transitions weekly Saturday 0800 run at Umstead, Harrison entrance. 1, 3, and 5 mile options are available..... See NMS below for more information.

No FNG's, Kotters to Clementine and Everready. Bluewater and Frisco head off to Bruisers. Let's GO!Brisk run to the Eastern gate for warmup: Burpees, SSH, Imp Walker, Windmills, Cotton pickers, and some other stuff. There were 3 late pax, leading to 30 burpee penalty.

Let's get going. Run around the park completing following ladder:  
Round 1: 5 burpees  
Round 2: 5 burpees & 6 Merkins  
Round 3: 5 burpees & 6 Merkins &7 cotton pickers  
R4: …8 squats  
R5: ….9 worlds worst merkins  
R6: …..10 LBCs  
R7: ……11  
R8: …….12 Hello Dolly's  
R9: ……..13th round of a Jack Webb  
R10: ……..14 Burpee

Half way through the Ladder, we completed 1/2 Cindy, interupting the Bruisers: - 5 pull-ups - 10 merkins - 15 squats - 5 round

Billy Run, starting in sitting position, back facing the flag

Finish up with Mary: Hammers, Boat Canoe, Dolly, Freddy Mercuries, and Have a nice day

Banjo took us out.Prayers for Karma Chamelion and speedy recovery.

NMS:  

- Not necessarily a bait and switch, but YHC knew Karma Chamelion would not be up for the Q and did not share with anyone.
- The Brisk run before warmup was not a crowd pleaser
- Healing Transitions run: Following Phoenix, Ollie joined YHC at Umstead / Harrison along with 23 HT pax. YHC, Bobby, Derek, Josh, Emily, and Meredith completed Company Mill to the bridle trail; 5.27 miles at 11.1 min mile - WOW! One of the pax invited YHC to be his sponsor. What an honor. Following, YHC took 4 pax to their A.A. meeting, great fellowship was had on the way. I challenge you to consider running, rucking with these gentlemen on any given Saturday, you will be rewarded.

Thank you gentlemen.
