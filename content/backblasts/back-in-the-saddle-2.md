You ever had one of those moments when that which you once found easy to do is now quite taxing. It has almost been three weeks since I last posted. Many HIMs have reached out to check in on me during this time and I am appreciative. Never the less it was time to get back in the saddle. There's nothing like putting yourself on the hook to Q to hold you accountable to posting. The most challenging part of the entire Q was doing one of the most simplest of tasks... counting cadence.

12 Pax arrived on a chillier than expected Monday morning to get themselves right. After a quick disclaimer we moseyed around the pickle and incorporated some High Knee, Butt Kicker, Cariocas and Bear Crawls before circling up for warm up.

Warmup- Steve Earle, Nancy Kerrigan, Cotton Picker, Superman, Dive Bomber, Good Morning.

Thang 1 - With Kettle bells in hand we mosey down to the pond to set up our circuit. Dividing into three groups of 4 we split off into the following stations. Station 1 - 1 Pull-up. Station 2 - 2 Goblet Squats. Station 3 - 3 Merkins. Sprint to each station until completing the circuit and return to plank hold. Set 2 - Repeat stations 1 - 3 but x2 at every station. Set 3 -x3. Set 4 - x4. Set 5 - x5. Set 6 - x6. Set 7 - x10.

Mosey back to the flag for Mary and COT.
