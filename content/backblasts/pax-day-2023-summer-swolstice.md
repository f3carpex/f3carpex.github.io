#### **8 years ago**...

Shaken Not Stirred was the only workout on a Wednesday in Cary or Apex. 9 Pax posted that day for a Burt Q - [**READ THE BB**](https://f3raleigh.com/its-shaken-not-shakin)

#### **5 years ago** today!...

Carpex had a convergence of great proportions to hear Chinese Downhill's testimony. It was an amazing day for F3 Carpex. There were 77 pax - including from Raleigh and South Wake. - **[READ THE BB](https://f3carpex.com/more-than-just-a-workout-carpex-convergence/)** | **[WATCH THE TESTIMONY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccUxBFBHumg)**

#### **TODAY**...

That "Carpex" is now the GCR (Greater Carpex Region) which consists of 4 Regions and something like 11 Areas of Operation.

And it was on this day we set out to make history and set the bar for what this GCR is capable of doing!

**184 Pax posted** on this day from our regions --some were down range but wanted to participate from afar.

## The Goal

While many of us focused hard on the goal of hitting 200 it's important to look at what the REAL mission of today was. When we start our workouts we state the mission of F3 -- no one gets back to the flag 45 minutes later and says, "nailed the mission". The Mission is bigger than the goal.

The MISSION of Pax Day, _some call it Summer Swolestice_, is not really to hit a specific number. **The _mission_ is to REinvigorate ourselves, our neighbors, and the GCR.**

- If a man posted today who hasn't posted in over a week, **that's the win.**

- If an FNG posted today, **that's the win.**

- If you DEFINITELY DIDN'T WANT TO POST TODAY...and you did, **that's the win.**

- If you posted down range today to contribute, **that's the win.**

- If we, as 4 regions, were unified for one mission today, **that's the win.**

- And lastly, if you reached out to a guy you haven't seen in a while and encouraged him to post I guarantee it felt like something bigger to him than the idea of just hitting our 200 pax quota...**and THATS the win!**

It just so happens today at Refinery we started 1 Corinthians 12 where two things stood out on a day like today: One, each of the pax of Corinth are called to use their gifts "for the common good" - not just themselves individually. And two, each pax plays a part in forming one body. We are individuals and we are part of AOs and we make up four regions...but we are one unified body with one Mission: to invigorate male community leadership.

### **Every single man in that 184 number is a win.**

NOW...goals, like 200 pax, are used to drive you to achieve but **Records** are meant to be broken. A record is now set.

See you for Pax Day 2024!!!!!
