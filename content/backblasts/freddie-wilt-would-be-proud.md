**Pre-Pre-BB**

My 68 year old father just crushed six months of chemo and radiation. I cannot say THANK YOU enough to my brothers in F3. You faithfully prayed for dad and my family throughout his whole ordeal. Words fall short, but I'll use them anyway. I appreciate you all very, very much. In honor of dad's incredible achievement, we'll begin with 68 SSH.

**Pre-BB (excerpted from Wikipedia)**

Plyometrics, also known as "jump training" or "plyos", are exercises in which [muscles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle "Muscle") exert maximum force in short intervals of time, with the goal of increasing power (speed-strength). This training focuses on learning to move from a muscle [extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology) "Extension (kinesiology)") to a [contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction "Muscle contraction") in a rapid or "explosive" manner, such as in specialized repeated jumping.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plyometrics#cite_note-1) Plyometrics are primarily used by [athletes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson "Sportsperson"), especially [martial artists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts "Martial arts"), sprinters and [high jumpers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_jump "High jump"),[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plyometrics#cite_note-2) to improve performance,[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plyometrics#cite_note-Yessis-3) and are used in the fitness field to a much lesser degree.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plyometrics#cite_note-4) **The term "plyometrics" was coined by [Fred Wilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Wilt "Fred Wilt")** after watching Soviet athletes prepare for their events in track and field; he felt this was a key to their success.
