15 HIM gathered under starlit skies to welcome the new week. 5 of us were (are) recovering from either running or rucking the Tobacco Road Half Marathon, so YHC had a special recovery edition planned. The theme featured plenty of Broga to loosen us up, and a few traditional bootcamp moves to keep everything moving.

Round up the PAX for the pledge (YHC was a little disoriented but eventually got redirected to the flag...)

**Praise/Prayers:**

- Parker's FIL Dave dealing with scary diagnosis, possible bone/metastatic cancer
- Christchurch, NZ and healing for families and community; end to such hatred

**NMS:**

- As always, thank you for the opportunity to lead...especially outside of the comfort zone doing some Broga. It was a much needed stretch post race!
