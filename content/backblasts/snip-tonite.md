Nine PAX made it out to Kryptonite for a Monday morning Q to start the week off right. I decided to join Kryptonite Sunday evening and saw the Q spot was open. A quick message to Bagels confirmed and I decided to put a workout together. I have a love/hate relationship with F3 high-intensity workouts and thought doing the Q may help make amends. At 530 AM, we kicked it off on-time with the Pledge, and off we went.
