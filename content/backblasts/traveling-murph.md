Observed Veteran’s Day seemed like a good time to pull out a modified Murph. For those that aren’t familiar, it is a workout named for Lt. Michael Murphy, a Navy Seal killed in action, who was famous for doing this workout daily while wearing body armor or a weighted vest.

100 Pull-ups

200 Push-ups

300 Squats

1-mile Run

I am not sure that we hit any of these on the number and nobody wore a ruck, but we were close on all of them and worked hard.

Unfortunately, I failed to mention thanking all who serve or have served in the military. Parker, thanks for what you shared on Slack this morning.

Ma Bell, per google, these are other terms for panache -  confidence, self-assurance, style, flair, elan, dash, verve, zest, spirit, brio, éclat, vivacity, gusto, liveliness, vitality, energy, flamboyance. Most of them fit an F3 workout, although I have no idea what a few of them mean. I will take Pivot's description as a compliment. 

How about Franklin and the tomato suit. Hopefully he breaks it out again when we can see it.

Props to Banjo for knocking out a Heavy and then hitting 4:45 EC this morning with Snots and Ollie, although Snots did have some issues of the Pet Sounds variety.

Thanks to the Crema crew who helped me come up with all of the names morning, including Flaccid.

Wolverine has been attracting some big crowds lately. It was an honor and a privilege to lead.
