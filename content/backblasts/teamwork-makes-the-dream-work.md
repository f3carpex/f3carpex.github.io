With the cool brisk October air in full effect, 21 PAX including 2 FNGs gathered at Hunterest of all Parks in anticipation. Some were wearing tanks, but more were not. First exercise, pledge of allegiance.

### Warm Up

SSHs, Good mornings, Sir Fazio, Runner's stretch, calf stretch, Plank jacks, and CFMs.

### Pre-Thang

33 burpees to the dulcet tones of AC/DC's Brian Johnson singing Thunderstruck.

### The Actual Thang

Split into 2 teams to execute the following:

- 50 Merkins OR Cinder block swings, 100 squats, 150 LBCs
- Run 1 lap around the soccer field
- 50 Merkins OR Cinder block swings, 100 squats, 150 LBCs
- Run 1 lap
- 50 Merkins OR Cinder block swings, 100 squats, 150 LBCs
- Run 1 lap AS A TEAM

Rules were pretty simple - on the final round of exercises those who had completed theirs could help their teammates complete, then finish that last lap as a team. Well done Team 2.

### Mary

LBCs until the 6 arrived back at the flag, then Team 1 paid off their 5 burpees. Team 2, HIMs that they are, did 5 burpees also.

### COT

21 total, 1 hate with a few Respects and 2 FNGs from St. Louis. Welcome Average (Joe) and Vidal Sassoon.

Prayers for Disco's MIL and M, YHC's mom, and Ezekiel's mom recovering from surgery. Also remember F3's Toby from Cape Fear, who left us too early. No OYO!

YHC took us out.

### NMS

- I agree with Disco Duck that there should have been more tank tops
- Term Paper served the role of timekeeper
- TClaps to Parker for bringing the coupons, allowing YHC to audible a bit for some variety and Ironpax flavor
- TClaps to Side Saddle for remembering his name
- TClaps to Crimson for bringing Side Saddle as well as our 2 FNGs. We had discussed earlier that he was expecting to bring those guys, and wanted them to get the best of F3. You guys delivered that, well done!
- The theme of the day was No Man Left Behind. I really enjoyed seeing how the teams approached this in their own unique way - but both delivered the goods.
- Be a little better today than you were yesterday. Keep doing that, every day.
