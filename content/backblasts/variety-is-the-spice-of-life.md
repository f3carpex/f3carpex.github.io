4 (3 runners and a rucker) showed up at BO for the #meowmile. We picked up 3 more at the halfway point where Hello Kitty subjected us all to _HIS_ 55 fantasy football penalty merkins on the way back. Wait, did I just type that? Merkins are a bonus, a pleasure, a treasure, dare I say a gift from God. After the completion of the #meowmile, we gathered up at the flag for the traditional "swapping of the shirts" for #TTT

18 were off for the Ma Bell beatdown, while 2 took off on a Rolling Stone ruck adventure promising to converge at 0630

Then pick up the 6 and do the last set again.

NMS

- It was good to see Sputnik's return to the crime of the century where Chanticleer broke his wrist. Bad Chanticleer!
- Welcome Mississippi back from Leadership School. Aye!
- Kitty, don't challenge YHC with yo' merkin nonsense (#merkinonsense) on Twitter. It will not end well for you.
- Merkin count, including Kitty's warm-up meowkins and an extra round of BLIMPS = 190. Meh. If you count the merkin in the burpees, then the total is 225. Better.
- There were some irkins in front of Cary Elementary the Arts Center but it was kind of OYO so I didn't count those.
- One day, I swear I will figure out how to get 500 merkins in a workout. May have to be at Phoenix. Where. Is. That. Q. Sheet?
- Earhart said he liked the variety of the workout. I shall endeavor to incorporate more variety going forward. Ma Bell always appreciates feedback. Whether he chooses to act on it is a different story.
- Why am I talking about myself in the 3rd person?
- Half, next time you want to whine about the grass being wet, don't be next to Ma Bell.
- Wait, there I go again with the 3rd person thing.
- It was honor to lead men willing to work. YOU make YHC better.
