I've Q'd enough times (though not as much lately) that I'm not usually nervous beforehand. I was nervous today, anticipating the reaction of the PAX at what I had in store. Still, I had it on good authority that it was a worthy idea.

Huh. Two minutes to go, FNG present, big PAX turnout, and aforementioned Good Authority nowhere to be seen. Well, let's make the most of it.

### Warm-up

Jog to Community Center lot. SSH x25, slooooow GM x10, 'merican x20. Lotsa mumblechatter. "Hey Q, when you gonna quiet things down?" Soon.

### Thang

I'm doing a thing in a couple weeks. We've been told this is part of it. PAX all get to be unwitting (yet willing!) volunteers to try it out with me.

**Rx:** 100 burpees, 1mi run, 50 burpees, 1mi run. For time, goal 35min. 1mi is out and back to gate near large shelter.

**Scaled:** Partner up, P1 burpee while P2 runs laps of parking lot (~ 1/5 mile). Alternate to squat & LBC if needed.

The PAX took the news well. Mostly. I think about a quarter did the out & back, and everybody made the time hack.

Upon YHC's return from mile 2, a circle-of-Mary had broken out. We continued that with 30x flutter kick IC, 20x dying cockroach IC, 10x merican. Jog to Billy Run Road, and do the thing. 25x American Hammer at the flag to finish us out. Already did those? Good for you.

### COT

Good work today, fellas. Sometimes life throws some hard stuff at you all at once. Not that today's workout compares to the difficulties some of us have faced or will face. Thanks for the camaraderie, it'll be a source to draw upon while doing hard things.

Welcome FNG Mad Dawg! I promise, they're not all like this.
