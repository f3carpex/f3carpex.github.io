While planning my first Q at Hot For Teacher, I thought back to my school days. I don't remember most of my teachers, but I remember Mrs. Johnson. She was a mean old witch who pushed her students hard and didn't tolerate any nonsense. I hated her back then, but now I wish my own 2.0 could have a teacher just like her.

With that inspiration, here's what we did.

Mosey around the parking lot then cut across the grass because the Q doesn't know there's a sidewalk ten feet ahead of us, then circle up for 11 burpees (one for each pax in sleeves), hillbillies (because we're in Apex), cotton pickers, copperhead squats, copperhead merkins and the worst cadenced Good Mornings since my last attempt.

Safely mosey across Olive Chapel Road to the first entrance on Kelly Road, stopping to admire the benches at the top of the hill on our way.

Thang 1: 22's with a twist, derkins at the top of the hill, prisoner squats at the botton, with an all you got on the first half of the trip up.

Mosey through the Publix parking lot, safely cross Olive Chapel Road to the school parking lot.

Thang 2: Partner up, nothing matters, P1 runs the pickle while P2 bear crawls the pickle, flapjack when you meet up.

Mosey back to the flag and circle up for some pax-led Mary, including box cutters, LBCs, American hammers and low slow Freddy Mercs.

NMS Sub tried to call quick feet during Mary, but YHC ain't having none of that.

Got to meet Mai Tai, his first post was at the lake with Ma Bell, all he said about their work out was they did a lot of push ups.

We've barely scratched the surface with this site, lots of fun and painful things to do here, and one more reason to blast Van Halen at five in the morning.
