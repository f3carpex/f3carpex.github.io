Late Sunday night (like 9 PM) I noticed that there was a Q change. Sir Joseph Smith Esquire was in the throes of sleep training and needed someone to take his Q. Pet Sounds undoubtedly pulled the short straw from the PAX at the Sublime concert and would be our substitute Q...............what could go wrong??? I mean the concert was at Koka Booth, just sleep in your BFT, set your alarm for 5:25 and figure out the rest.

6 total PAX for pre-runs. 3 turned left out of the lot, and 3 others spun a couple lake laps. 12 total gathered, for the main event. None were named Pet Sounds or Pete. Lots of mumble about who would take the Q. The PAX easily had 5 minutes to step-up. 1 minute till workout (no Q yet......excitement building.....this might actually happen!!!), I quietly asked Site Q and barista Wonderbread if I could take the Q, he gave me the Nod. Woohoo! So excited, I forgot the disclaimer.

Warm-up: Run to the lake trail head for 20 SSH, 10 IW, 10 PJs, 10 MCs, 10 GMs.  
Thang 1: Run up the hill stopping at every light pole for 5 star jumps.  
Thang 2: At the bottom of the hill at The Avenue of the Estates for Quadruple Nickels. Up Richelieu for 5 start jump, back down to Ave of Estates for 5 squats, up to Ederlee for 5 merkins and back to bottom for 5 LBCs. Repeato 4 times.  
Thang 3: Run back toward the flag, stopping along the way for 10 Irkins IC.  
Cool down: Lunge walk the parking lot, 15 LBCs, HAND.  
We covered 4.3 miles and 450 feet of elevation gain, the tempo was high. BRR training, you're welcome. Consider yourselves Sleep Trained!

Announcements - Maynard on Wednesday, Hermes on the cooler.  
Prayers for Dion who is Chippers M, and South Wake PAX who lost his father.  
YHC took us out. Wonderbread served us coffee.
