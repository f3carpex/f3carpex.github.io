Hermes 3rd f3aversary. Danger Zone. A perfect 43 degrees. Full moon. What's not to love? 13 of the strongest ever to grace the Carpex gloom showed up to keep Danger Zone great. Former site Qs such as Burt, Largemouth, and Callahan were not among them.

## Warmup

1Â½ times around the original pickle and circle up for an arm circle variety pack - regular, overhead, out front. Mumblechatter may have been at an all-time high at this point. Standard Merkins - properly done in cadence - shut all that up. Sloooow GMs let everyone admire their pecs. Let's go!

## The Thang

Travel through the dimly lit and cluttered shelter out to the trails and down to and across the first bridge. Split into 1s and 2s. 1s bear crawl across the bridge while 2s do 20 Merkins, 20 Squats, 25 Dying Cockroaches. 1s do the same once across the bridge. 2s bear crawl once done with the exercises. Grab a rock for come curls and epic jokes. Jog back across the bridge. Repeato except lunge walk across the bridge with 20 diamond Merkins, 20 Chubby Ballerinas, and 25 LBCs. Grab a rock for tricep extensions and more jokes. Jog back across the bridge and repeato with 20 T-Merkins, 20 CDDs, and 25 Ballerina Squats. Grab your rock for O/H presses.

Quick jog around the loop, stopping at the rock climbing wall for some burpees OYO. Continue on to the shelter for 15 x (Derkins IC, Dips IC, Alt L/R Step-Ups IC), 10 x (Derkins IC, Dips IC, Alt L/R Step-Ups IC), and 5 x (Derkins IC, Dips IC, Alt L/R Step-Ups IC). Then, finally to cap off the shelter visit for the second time only in the history of F3, the patented Fingerburp Humperdip. 10 OYO #keepcarpexweird
