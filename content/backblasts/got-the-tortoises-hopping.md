Date: January 29, 2020 QC: TRAFFIC CONE AO: TORTOISES PAX: BUBBA, CRIMSON, EZEKIEL, HOTTY TODDY, INTIMIDATOR, RAMSEY, TRAFFIC CONE.

I have been with F3 Carpex for 17 months and thanks to Crimson and Sooey. This was my 3rd Q after all the encouragement I have received from Disco Duck, and Theissman. Still had butterflies in my stomach and kept going over cadence count whenever I woke the night before. Crimson was ready to drive (Yes he does drive! As you all know he is a great friend any man would like to have, I am lucky to have him as my neighbor) with the preheated car and butt warmers. It is a short drive to tortoises and I was too excited and was going over the routine with Crimson as he drove.

I had all the workout exercises on my trusted phone all ready to go. At the last minute drew up enough courage and abandoned the phone and decided to go with the flow.

Weather was not too bad it was fair and about 32 degrees. No FNGs, just Ramsey moving up from South Wake? Started with disclaimer and the Pledge of Allegiance at the flag. Mosey around the parking lot and circle up in front of the church.

Performed warm-up exercises in cadence. • 10 Good Mornings (count down and count up) • 10 Seal claps • 10 Surfazio arm circles • 10 Reverse Surfazio arm circles • 10 count each Cat Stretch right over left, and left over right • 10 Cobra pose • 10 Burpees OYO • 15 Side straddle hops.

Thang 1: Mosey back down to the bigger parking lot. Partner up for Dora Partner 1 • 100 Merkins • 200 LBC • 300 Squats

Partner 2 Lunge walk down to the first island and bear crawl back up. The Bear Crawl Master Hotty Toddy was at his best – no one could catch him, although Crimson kept trying.

Thang 2: Moseyed to the picnic bench area and continued partner exercises. • 20 Pull ups • 40 Step ups • 60 Dips

Thang 3: • Mosey to the wall on the south side of the church. • People’s chair with each HIM counting 10. YHC counted in Kannada. • Next Balls to the Walls and again each HIM counting 10. YHC counted in Hindi

Mosey back to the flag and circle for Mary.

Circle up for Mary. Starting with Crimson called on each HIM to lead a favorite Mary • American Hammers • Homer to Marge • Box Cutters • LBC • 10 burpees • Freddie Mercury were called.
