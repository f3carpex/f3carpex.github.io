Someone mentioned to me last week that I had the Q this week at FOD. I had not remembered that. It would have been super embarrassing to travel across CarPEX Nation and miss a Q at FOD. I mean, who does that? Anyway, given this is the OG Tuesday AO in CarPEX, I wanted to bring it. Nobody splashed but the level of hatred thrown my way leads YHC to the following conclusion: mission accomplished. Here's what we did...

**Warm-Up**

Jog up the pickle toward the baseball and back down, across the street to the shelter parking lot around the back island and circle up for

- 5 x GM IC - Happy Birthday, Nature Boy! K, enough of the niceties
- 5 **B**urpees OYO
- 7 x **L**unges IC
- 10 x **I**mperial Walkers IC
- 20 x **M**erkins IC
- 10 x **P**lank Jacks IC
- 10 x Prisoner **S**quats IC

A portent of things to come? Youbetcha!

**The Thang**

Form up into 4 groups, mosey over to the rock pile and grab one rock per group. Indian Run up to the mailbox by handing the rock back. Last man sprints to the front. Once at the top, drop your rocks in the mulch and line up for Progressive B.L.I.M.P.S. across the USA Baseball parking lot.

- 1st trip - stop at each island for 5 Burpees. At the end, do 5 Worst Merkins Ever. Run back
- 2nd trip - at each island do 5 Burpees and 10 Lunges. 5 Worst Merkins Ever. Run back
- 3rd trip - at each island do 5 Burpees, 10 Lunges, and 15 Imperial Walkers. 5 Worst Merkins Ever. Run back
- 4th trip - at each island do 5 Burpees, 10 Lunges, 15 IWs, 20 Merkins, and 25 Plank Jacks. 5 Worst Merkins Ever. Run back.

Almost out of time. Assemble back at the near end of the parking lot and do 30 Prisoner Squats IC as a group.

Reassemble your groups, grab your rock, and Indian Rock Run back to the shovel flag, dropping your rock carefully back on the pile. No time for Mary.

**COT**

**Count-a-rama:** 29 **Name-a-rama:** 3 RESPECTS, 26 Meh **Announcements**: Odyssey 10/20; Band-Aid Drive **Prayers/Praises**: Sooey's and Crimson's friend Dave who lost his wife recently; the folks impacted by the Hurricane and flooding **BOM**: YHC took us out

**Nekkid Moleskin**

- About 1/2 way through the BLIMPS set, YHC started seeing lots of "you're #1" signals. That is not what the PAX meant
- Today's workout was brought to you by the letter 'F' based on the number of words hurled at YHC that started with that letter
- Chad seemed to be enjoying himself. Simmer down, Chad
- YHC was reminded of the famous Dale Carnegie book _How to Win Friends and Influence People._ Apparently, I'm doing it wrong.
- I don't care
- You'll thank me later
- Happy Birthday, Nature Boy!
- What's the over/under on how many times he forgets his age during name-a-rama over the next year?
- Thanks to Franklin for being YHC's enforcer. Never question the Q, Chad
- I'm glad Saban wasn't there to witness YHC's time management
- It was honor to lead - and in general be around - you HIM!
