Sometime during VQ week, I noticed that the Kryptonite spot was open for the following week. Boom, chicken soup. Got it.

17 others showed up, and most of the pre workout discussions centered on how no one feared my Qs anymore. 17 is more than I am used to. I would set my PAX over/under at 10.5. And i have had a few last minute fill ins Qs the have upped that to double digits.

I embrace the unsuspecting PAX, and enjoy making him better. That is why no one fears my Qs, because I have made you all better, faster, stronger........so you're welcome.

Fast disclaimer, and we are off. Headed around the lake stopping for a warmup. 20 SSH, 10 Mtn climbers, 10 GMs, 10 Plankjacks, 20 meekins.

Partner up for catch me if you can around the lake. 3 hand-release merkins (signature move) then catch you partner, switch and Repeato.

Then up the hill, 2 burpee-broadjumps at each light pole to the top.

In the new jumbo parking lot, set of 5s. Irkins at the bottom, burpees at the top.

The to the Avenue of the Estates. Back wth your partner for opposite way loop run, when you meet - 10 HRMs.

Head back to the flag with a stop on the rail for irkins.

Back in the home parking lot. Not done yet. Back with your partner. Opposite direction, sprint then when you meet your partner jog. Repeato for 4 laps.

No Mary, no HAND. 4.25 miles covered.

Announcements - Haven House raffle and boxing. See Burt or Coney. Odyssey sign up.

Praise for Gillian who is home recovering from his valve replacement.

YHC prayed us out.

NMS - Flip-Flop noted that I always grab the first Q spot immediately after VQ week. Maybe I do............he says I like to boost my confidence. Well that would not be the case this year. All the VQs crushed it! It was a challenge to follow those guys this year. And I will welcome that challenge again next year.
