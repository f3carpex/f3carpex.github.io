11 pax came for the beatdown. 4 for the first time to Claymore. 1 site Q was there (Frisco was not the one.) TCLAPS for Earhart making his way back out after a scare with his digestive system (and praises!)

Sometimes you plan a workout and then you get to the site and realize there are 2-3 more tennis courts than you thought there were.

**Oops!**

I intended to keeps our bodies moving for 45 mins, and we did, but in doing so maybe we did too many miles. I heard some complaints. Site Qs might object to my return. We'll see, the jury is still out.

- Baseball field Jack Webs: 3 sets run to other foul line / 3 sets, etc to 10
- Tennis Court Suicides: Run to each court, perform exercise, backwards run back to the start.
    - 1 burpee
    - 2 jump lunges
    - 3 merkins
    - 4 monkey humpers
    - 5 american hammers

2.5 miles. COT.
