Sixteen gathered at the flag for the first exercise, the Pledge of Allegiance. After disclaimers are given and allegiance is pledged, mosey to the large parking lot. One coming in hot brings it to 17.

### Warm Up

SSHs, Cotton-pickers, Moroccan Night Clubs, Sir Fazio, Plank Jacks and Control Freak Merkins

### Thang 1

Modified Cooper - instead of exercises each lap, we are going to stop twice per lap to complete in descending fashion - 10 Burpees, 10 Squats, 10 Merkins. Once complete, gather the six. Mosey to the bottom of the hill.

### Thang 2

Partner up for a round of Burpback Mountain. Partner 1 works on 100 burpees. Partner 2 backwards runs up the hill to the 2nd light pole, moseys back. Flip flop until complete. Second round, Partner 1 does 50 Star Jumps while Partner 2 Bear crawls to the first light pole, flip flop until complete.

### Mary

One round of Captain Thor - 1:4 Big Boy sit ups/American hammers, up to 10:40. Mosey back to the flag.

### COT

2 Hates, 4 Respects, 11 Mehs

Announcements: The Mule, Lion's Den soft launch Wednesday at St. Mary's, F3 Boone launch (see Hello Kitty).

Praises/prayers: Family of Skyler - teen from Grace Christian who died from the flu. Joe Smith and family with (overdue) impeding baby.

YHC took us out.

### NMS

I ain't gonna lie. There is a little bit of pressure when Q'ing this site. These boys want it brought, as they should. I always enjoy the challenge. Joe Smith was the PAX who rolled in hot, and let's just say the mosey was on a quick pace to try and make him work for it, but he was right in the mix when we got to the destination.

Just remember, high tempo does not mean always running. We got in approximately 95 burpees each this morning. It sucked.

Make it a great day, and be just a little better today than yesterday.
