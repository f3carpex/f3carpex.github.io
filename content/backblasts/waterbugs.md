A big downpour in downtown Cary was not enough to keep five waterbugs away from Rush Hour.

**Warm-Up**

Brisk walk over to the far side of the pocket park for imperial walkers, Sir Fazios, mountain climbers, merkins, squats and cotton pickers.

**The Thang**

Brisk walk to the middle of the pocket park, then bear crawl to the side with the wall for irkins, ALRSUs, dips, ALRSUs and derkins.

Bear crawl back to the middle for LBCs, American hammers, Homer-to-Marge, low slow flutters and dying cock-a-roaches.

Bear crawl to the far side for merkins, prisoner squats, carolina dry docks, sumo squats and wide grip merkins.

Bear crawl back to the middle for LBCs, American hammers, Homer-to-Marge, low slow flutters and dying cock-a-roaches.

Bear crawl to the other side with the wall for irkins, ALRSUs, dips, ALRSUs and derkins.

Brisk walk to the Town Hall bridge then lunge walk to the end, five world's worst merkins, lunge walk back.

Grab some hand rails for the Ollie countdown, ten irkins and ten Australian pull-ups, then nine, on down to one.

Brisk walk back to the pocket park and circle up. We had three recent Q School graduates, and they each led us in a Mary exercise, all three nailed it, all three are ready to Q.
