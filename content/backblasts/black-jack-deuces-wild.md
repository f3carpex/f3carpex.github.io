A good group of card sharks gathered this morning for a little game of Black Jack. However, counting, running, time and just good old common sense seemed to be our enemy, and although we had a good workout, we didn't finish the game.

We left the small parking lot and headed to the large parking lot doing a like backwards run and karaoke on the way and circled up right in the middle of the main entrance. We aint scared.

**Warm Up**

Good Morning, Windmill, Sir Fazio Arm Circles, Steve Earle, SSH, Mnt Climber

**The Thang**

Head to the last row in the parking lot and partner up. P1 run to the left (about 50-75yards) P2 run to the right (about 50-75yards) each perform 20 Carolina Dry Docks. Run back, meet in the middle and perform 2x Partner Squats, Hand Clap Merkins, Bropees, then continue to the opposite end of the parking lot for 1 LBC. Repeat lowering the CDD by 1 and increasing the LBCs by 1 always equaling 21.

And although luck was on our side (always getting back jack) time was not. We only got a little more than half way through before we had to run back to the flag.

**COT**

Announcements: Carying Place 5k/10k; There was some mention of an unsanctioned, ill-conceived upcoming convergence and possible mutiny, but I didn't get all the details.

Prayers for Grease Monkey and his family. A few guys are heading up to VA for the services. Reach out to Half or Hermes if you're interested; Largemouth's son was recently bit by a snake; Chanticleer making a big career decision today.

YHC took us out with a quote from poet James Terry White

> It is not necessary for a man to be actively bad in order to make a failure in life; simple inaction will accomplish it. Nature has everywhere written her protest against idleness;  against everything which ceases to struggle toward an ideal, a protest against a lack of constant effort to get higher and further, for these are the things which develops manhood and character.
