23 Fools helped YHC celebrate 43 years.

Following the welcome, disclaimer, and pledge we warmed up the hammies with some high kicks, butt kickers, and imperial walkers.

We proceeded to Mosey with Bruisers continuing the butt kickers and high knees and runners taking a stroll around the new coffeteria location in Amberly.

THANG 1: We warmed up with a series of exercises and stretches to get us ready for 7s on the hill with Copperhead Merkins at the top and monkey humpers at the bottom.

THANG 2: Once done, we proceeded to the wall and counted off, 1s hit the wall and 2s hit the ground for chill cut. We proceeded through flip flopping a series of 4 sets with various Mary and wall work.

We wrapped with some Pom Pom inspired shoulder work and side lunged back to the flag before ending with a set of 100s.
