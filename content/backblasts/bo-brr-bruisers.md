5 for Meow Mile 5 for Bruisers led by Disco Duck and WWW after he went back home to get his shoes. 15 for some BRR prep. 1-minute warning, Attn Pax: Disco and WWW are leading a no-run injured reserve option at 5:45, YHC is leading the BO workout that will include a bit of running.  You need to make a decision right now.

The Thang: Follow me - run down Walker, left on Walnut, stop in at the church parking lot for some Good Mornings, HillBillies and some Merkins. Continue running down Walnut, stop in at the Dad Park for 51 LBCs in cadence, Continue running to left on Maynard to the fire station parking lot for 20 merkins. I think Banjo led Red Lobster on a modify as needed at this point that must have involved trampling through some yards to get back to the Bruisers guys.  Thank you for your Leadership in looking out for the six brother! Continue running up and down some Maynard hills.  Everyone needs some of The Maynard in their life. Get in the line that is already forming at the DMV.  10 Cadence Count Monkey Humpers at the DMV. Continue running up Maynard to Chatham.  50 Dips at the brick bench at the typical TOC artsy sculpture thing at the corner. Continue running down Chatham to the grassy area in front of Urban Park for 52 more LBCs in cadence. Continue running down Chatham extending the F3 invite to a couple men along the way. Continue running down Chatham collect at Walker Street so Light Bright can lead us home. Continue running behind Light Bright winding through the parking lot back to the Flag. Circle up - 10 Burpees OYO.

COT - 20 Pax. Announcements - All CARPEX AO's closed Friday so we can celebrate the 1 year anniversary of Slippery When Wet at Danger Zone. - TCP Sawgrass this Sunday, Labor Day 5/10k for Carying Place, 9/11 stair climb is on September 11th. Prayer Requests: - Grease Monkey and his family after the sudden tragic loss of his father - Angry Elf's friend Blake and family after the sudden tragic loss of his sister - Banjo's M Sarah for the tough season of work, study and some irritating back pain she is going through right now. - Angry Elf's mother and mother in-law with health concerns and for wisdom and motivation of the PAX to take care of their bodies. YHC took us out

NMS: - We have agreed on a friendly wager for our 2 BRR teams.  I think we are all getting better, some might just want to bet a little for some motivation.  Thank you to Old Maid for the great wager idea! - The Population of Lexington, SC is 20,988 people.  Cary and Apex is 209,669 people.  The population of Lochmere is estimated at 20,145 people.  F3 Lexington (SC) averages about 175 PAX posting daily.  They are fielding 9 teams of 12 for 108 Pax in the BRR.  Can you imagine what F3 Carpex would be like with 1,820 PAX posting daily? - Speaking of growth, if we are averaging 60 pax a day, should we not have at least 4 AO's daily.  Isn't 18+ problematic. - Is anyone interested in taking the realm as Co-Site Q at FWD?  Or is anyone interested in Site Qing at Walnut Street Park, Jack Smith Park, RS Dad Dunham Park or Annie Jones Park?  I think a limited run on Mondays, bootcamp Wednesday, high-tempo thursday and a bootcamp Saturday would be logical additions...  Yes, I know - Freed to Lead...
