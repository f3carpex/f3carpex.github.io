4 For EC 3ish mile standard loop - Banjo, Lookout, Joe Smiff and YHC.  
1 for EC 2ish mile jog - Chipper  
19 Showed up for the main event. Including some from the other side of Cary. Debrief Greenbow on the game plan for the route. Mention something about invigoration. Pledge allegiance and a 'follow me'.

The Thang:  
Jog up Cary Parkway to the 'not even an exit' future road tie-in on the right for a brief warm-up including Side Straddle Hops, Good Mornings and Hill Billies.  
Jog up Cary Parkway to that office building just past US1 on the right. 20 merkins, 5 big Sir Fazio Arm Circles (repeat thriceish- cutting it short on the last round to 10 merkins)  
Jog up Cary Parkway to the church building at Seabrook. 50 in cadence LBCs (That's 100 total Hoppin John).  
Jog down Seabrook to MacDonald Woods Park (or is is McDonald?). Do the merkin/arm circle thing again.  
Jog down the path to top of the esses at the beginning of the bridge.  
Run to middle of bridge do the inverted sunrise till failure, then do LBC's till everyone fails. Well done Pierogi and HoppinJohn!  
Jog down the path a ways and do 50 in cadence LBCs (thats 100 more).  
Jog down the path to the rock pile. 15 Rock V-ups, Merkins, Curls For Girls, repeat that a couple of times. Move out of the way to let the Ford Fusion by who apparently is meeting up for a casual encounter with Joe Smiff?  
Jog back to the flag and do 10 or so more merkins for good measure to finish 30 seconds early according to our time keeper -B-A-B.  
  
Name-a-Rama - 19 Pax including 2 Respects.  
Announcements: Freed to Bleed this Saturday, A registration paid is a registration made for F3 Carpex Dads Camp, its only $10.35. 
Prayer Requests: Chipper's mom is getting a pacemaker installed this week, Schroeder's knee surgery, Rooney and I think I missed one, my apologies.

YHC Announced I was vaccinated and offered the pax to either bring it in for a good old fashioned ball of man or to take a knee in place and then took us out.  
  
Greenbow provided trunk coffee, which was promptly cashed.

NMS:

- Wow, adding names by 'tags' on this word press thing is incredibly difficult. Typed all the names with commas as instructed and only counted 10 on the list that actually made it. The rest disappeared. Re-typed the missing 9 and only 7 made it, round 3 was the ticket though.
- Thanks to Pierogi, Banjo, B-a-B, Callahan and Snots for making the drive and skipping that lame Ma-Bell/Saban anniversary tour.
- The 'when i found out i was bald' discussion at coffeteria was fantastic.
- I think we are on to something with the F3 Carpex Bald Bros 2022 BRR team. There's going to be a couple of awkward recruiting conversations with some guys that don't seem to fully embrace the bald life yet. The George Castanza head shot on the tank tops will be spectacular!
- I'm grateful for you fellas! Make it a great day! and Thank you for your Leadership!
