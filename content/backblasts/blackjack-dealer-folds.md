In the fourth and final installment of Flaccoversary Week 2018, YHC's eyes were a little bigger than his stomach. We stepped up to a buffet of Wolverines and put a few more on our plate than we could stomach. More on that later, for now you just need to know that 16 HIM gathered at Bond Park ready to cap the week with a Flacco-style beatdown. Which is sure to include some yoga. And traffic-dodging Frogger.

Mosey to the gate and hang a right, butt-kick and karaoke your way to the pavilion. Circle up and warm up

**WarmUp**

- Good morning (led with flawless cadence and execution...this is getting off to a great start) x 10
- Plank calf stretch, both legs (because we have two)
- SSH x 21 (a theme is born)
- Annie Merkins (a theme is abandoned, 21 sounded like too many)

**The Thang**

Let's play Blackjack (a theme is reborn)

21's - L/R step ups at the pavilion; run to far end of the pickle; Wolverines. Yes, Wolverines. Yes, 21. (this will come back to haunt me)

YHC started off strong, blasting through the step ups and sprinting to the Wolverine station. The PAX mumbled something about "Q-drenaline" and "5-hour energy drinks for breakfast". This only inspired the Q to run harder. It was also inspiring to try and keep up with Biner.

Gradually a mutiny formed, led by Biner chirping in YHC's ear: "you know you can call it any time now, noone will think less of you". Again, this inspired YHC further. Hell no we're not gonna quit!

Yeah, that lasted 3 more sets. Then near death set in. Time to call it. YHC delivered the most inspirational speech since Remember the Titans, and the PAX nearly ran him over to get back to the Wolverine station. It was awesome. Or not.

Mosey back to the gate and engage in an impromptu game of Frogger at the crosswalk.

- Air chair with overhead hand claps while the PAX duck walks the crosswalk one at a time.
- Then back across, high knee skips. With panache. And jazz hands.
- Then back again, bear crawl.

Mosey back to the flag. Surprise, let's do some parking line shuffles and finish with a soccer tunnel. Just because.

Wait, we're not done - let's get our heartrates down and stretch it out with a little Broga Light.

**COT**

Who needs count-a-rama and name-a-rama? Not this Q. At least not until Sooey reminds me. There were 16 of us.

**Announcements**

- need some HIM on some Flo disaster recovery today; see Slack
- Odyssey, 10/20. it'll be in Apex
- Kitty eatin some pie on DTC today. Cheer him on! Watch him puke!
- And some other stuff. I think I blacked out.

**Praise/Prayers**

- Theismann family traveling to Orlando; safe travels and lots of fun!
- Disco Duck's M Kelly - test results coming
- Again, I think I blacked out. My apologies, we had two more requests

**NMS**

- I am so honored to spend my mornings with you gentlemen in the gloom. The power of fellowship and community is astounding. I always pray that I can offer even a fraction of what you guys offer me.
- Go Penn State.
