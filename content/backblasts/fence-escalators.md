For the second time in the past two months, YHC needed to carry out my site Q duties at Claymore by stepping in for a last-minute impromptu Q. Frisco had given me a heads up that the VQ he had lined up (no, not Frisco) for today might not show, so there were already some ideas percolating.

It's 0545, and after pledging allegiance at the shovel flag, we're off for a slow mosey around the circle. Then, it's right into the warmup:

- 5 slow Good Mornings IC
- 10 Imperial Walkers IC
- 10 Standard Merkins (a foreshadowing of what's to come)
- Sir Fazio frontwards and backwards, with Seal Claps in between.

Over to the fence and sidewalk along the left side of the parking lot for some escalators. Since this is limited-run, we won't cover much ground, but you'll get some work done along the way. Moving as a group, about every 10-15 feet along the fence line, do the following, repeating the previous exercises at each stop (you know, an escalator):

- 5 Derkins
- 10 Merkins
- 15 Irkins
- 20 Squats
- 25 LBCs

Work our way up the fence and back down. Then stretch our legs with a stroll over to the shovel flag while YHC comes up with the next thang:

We'll do the escalator routine again, but this time let's work something other than our shoulders:

- 5 Box Cutters
- 10 Sumo Squats
- 15 Quick Feet IC
- 20 WW2 sit-ups
- 25 Mountain Climbers

Six minutes left, so back over to the flag for some PAX-sourced Mary:

- Crunch Frogs (Press)
- Homer to Marge 3 ways (Frisco)
- Anvils (WWW)
- American Hammers (Joe Smith)
- Snow Angels (HGTV)
- Have a Nice Day (YHC)

COT - 6 PAX - 3 respects, 3 meh

Announcements: South Wake mulching service project at Bass Lake - see Slack for details/sign-up, mask-required workout led by Frisco on Wednesday at 530 at A-Team site, Odyssey - sometime in October, stay tuned for details.

Prayers/praises: Frisco's M, Chewie's recovery from back surgery, praises that Leprechaun has completed his Eagle project and paperwork has been turned in.

- Kinda fun to make it up as you go along and meet the challenge of a delivering a good beatdown that ends perfectly on time.
- Also gratifying to hear the groans as we got towards the top of the escalators.
- Always an honor to lead
