**Pre-BB**

THANKS and a BIG SHOUT OUT to all the Q's I've posted under since my first day...you all taught me well! Thanks, WaterWings for inviting me out. Grateful for the brotherhood! Thanks for the support today!

**BB**

'Twas Saturday morning and through-out CarPex not a creature was stirring except...Callahan, Old Maid, Hermes (gear), Pierogi (gear), Dice, Bo Jackson, Yoga Mat, Texas Ranger, Ollie (3rd Anniv.), Smokey, Crimson, Sooey, Napster, Shank, Yogi, Hi-Liter (VQ), Disco Duck, Mississippi, Biner, Bonham (FNG), Sour Mash, Large Mouth, Term Paper, Sky Blue, Free Bird, Bartman, and Red Dawn.

Beating the early morning heat and humidity, the 27-strong CarPex PAX assembled at Phoenix as Hi-Liter prepared for his VQ. The troops were pensively quiet...the men were unaware that they were about to be force-fed a man-sized helping of Turkish Delight.
