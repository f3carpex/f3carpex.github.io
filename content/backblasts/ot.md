Imma gonna keep this one short.

Why?

Because the real thing went loooooooong. By a fair amount. Like, Saban setting s#!% on fire long.

YHC arrived at FC a bit ahead of time and got some laps around the track in. No Sky Blue so no records were set but it was a nice mosey around the loop.

Get back to the flag to see some old faces and some new ones. Good to meet you both Antique and High School Musical. Pom Pom I think I've met before. Will have to go back to the tape.

As time gets close to "go" time, I inform those PAX not regulars on Slack (note: most of these guys are not regulars on the Slack... need to fix that) that this was going to be an IronPAX Q. It was pre-blasted so no surprises. It's apparently why Clementine and the aforementioned Sky Blue are MIA.

A pledge and go time

**Warm-up:**

Shoulders, chest and legs.

**Thang:**

Spent a bit too long explaining the concept behind the Week 1 Iron Pax challenge. It's already almost 6! Put Metallica's S&M2 on the playlist, started the Tabata timer and ....

31 minutes later we are still some lunges short of finishing.

**Mary:**

No time

**COT:**

10

Prayers and praises for Ms and kids.

**Post/NMS**

Added another ~seven minutes to allow the few of us doing the Iron PAX for reals to stick around and wrap things up. Very impressed that all 10 PAX hung back even tough only three or four of us were taking this thing for real. HIMs!

There was coffeeteria after. I missed it sadly. Hope yall had fun.

Lesson: explain the workout faster/earlier/as part of warm-up.

It was a pleasure.
