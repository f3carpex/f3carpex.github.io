I don't always leave my Qs to the whims and fancy of Fate, but when I do, I prefer dice.  Here's what we did:

**The Warm-Up (Beaker's Beginnings)**

Jog to the end of the lot for SSH, good mornings, SFACs, Franklins, IWs

Jog back to the shelter

**The Thang (Beaker's Beatdown)**

PAX assemble in a circle each with a kettle bell (**_A_** _kettle bell, I think you mean kettle bell**S** -_ Kubota).  1 PAX rolls the die to determine the exercise. While the rest of the PAX perform the exercise AMRAP, the dice-roller moseys over to the playground for 5x45lb swings, 5 pull-ups, and 5x45lb swings, then returns to lead all PAX on a mosey around the shelter.  Rotate clockwise and repeat.

1 - Curls

2 - Triceps

3 - Upright Rows

4 - Bent-over Rows

5 - Nutcrackers

6 - Deadlifts

**The Mary (Beaker's Bellies)**

I brought a 25lb plate to share.  We circled up on our sixes, PAX with the plate called and counted a Mary exercise (with bells, of course) then passed the plate to his left.  Repeat until time expired.

**The COT (Beaker's Benediction)**

Count-o-rama/Name-o-rama: Lucky number 13

Announcements: Memorial Day convergence at FOD at 0700

Prayers/Praises: Continued prayer for Hi-Liter and his family

**The NMS (Beaker's BS)**

Turns out that if you run a relatively short distance enough times, you can log some serious miles.  Today's total was 2.72miles

Crimson guarantees there ain't no 2nd F like a Vet 2nd F, so show up on Memorial Day

Speaking of Crimson, I learned some interesting facts about the man today........................................................the legend................................................................................about what he did after getting out of the Marines........................................................................................................specifically related to work.

 

 

Did you know Crimson has convinced his M to cut the grass?

Although he does bring her cool beverages.
