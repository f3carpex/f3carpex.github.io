**Summary**: A point to point 13.7 Mile run Saturday June 9, 2018. **The Thang:** - Buy a one-way ticket from Cary to Raleigh on the Amtrak 92 Silver Star departing Cary at 0808. $7.00. -Meet at Bradford’s Ordinary at 110 Waldo Street at 0745 on June 9th. - Warmup/mosey to the train station and wait on the train. - All aboard! - Get off at the 1st Stop at Raleigh’s new Union Station at the regular old station because, well i think the government is somehow involved in the project and the new station is behind schedule.  If on schedule (ha ha), this would be at 8:34 AM. -Run back.

**SIGN UP** **HERE:**  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oqdFH5EwQyK3WNvfdCVIOHXj3pAumSugunlRaEntJ4g/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oqdFH5EwQyK3WNvfdCVIOHXj3pAumSugunlRaEntJ4g/edit#gid=0)

**Route:** Get off train, run East on Cabarrus crossing over tracks,  to left on Dawson left, to Left on Hillsborough St. to Meredith College. Take greenway path at Meredith College Entrance. Take greenway path under Wade and over 440 up to Art Museum (Whiplash). Take Reedy Creek Road across Blue Ridge Road and across Edwards Mill Rd.  to Umstead Park entrance at end of Reedy Creek Road. Stay on the wide gravel path - Reedy Creek Multi-Use Trail in Umstead (no single tracks), turn left onto Reedy Creek Lake Multi-Use Trail to run by the lake.  This will become asphalt paved in the park and you will make a left where it ends to put you on Harrison Ave.  Take Harrison back to train station, make a left on Chatham and the first right on Academy and the first left back onto Waldo Street.

**Notes:** There will be multiple groups at varying paces, likely ranging between 7 min/mile and 10 min/mile.  Please follow all standard running safety protocol.

Working on details for aid stations and could use some VOLUNTEERS! At minimum there will be a cooler of water/Gatorade at the entrance to Umstead on Reedy Creek, this will be about mile 7.  We will likely have aid stations at the Art Museum (mile 5) and maybe on Harrison at Veterans Freedom Park (mile 10.5ish).

Enjoy the inaugural Pimento Cheese Festival in Down Town Cary immediately following finish.

See Hermes or Old Maid with questions.

**NMS:** - Yes, we know it will probably be hot that day.  We also know there is a pretty good chance it will be hot for one of your BRR legs. - Yes, Franklin is reportedly leading a separate option that involves eating brunch in Raleigh and Ubering back to Cary. - Yes, the mileage is accurate.  This is not like the CSAUP where 8ish becomes 13 miles.  Unless you plan on getting lost. - Yes, this is completely stupid and utterly pointless. - Yes, there will be someone to run with at your pace.  I know this because you are going to recruit them to join you. - Yes, there is a fee to participate.  If you need assistance with the cost of the $7.00 train ticket, we have scholarships available. - Yes, this is just a little longer than The Maynard.  If you can do Insomnia and Vesper, then you can do The Maynard.  If you can do The Maynard, you can certainly do the Crazy Train. - Yes, Fry Daddy, you can post at Whiplash that same morning and still have time to make it to this. - Yes, the Pimento Cheese Festival in Downtown Cary is a real thing.  No, I am not joking.
