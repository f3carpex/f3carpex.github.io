NMS Much discussion about the Pearl Jam heavy playlist. @Repeato picked up on portions so for clarification the lyrics for Yellow Leadbetter are:

On a weekend I wanna wish it all away, yeah And they called and I said that I'll go And I said that I'll call out again And the reason I ought ta leave her calm, I know I said, "I don't know whether I'm the boxer or the bag"

The “One Hand on Brick “ Merkins was a hit. Gateway to doing the One handed Merkin….

@Yogamat loves the cinder blocks and wonders why these are not used for every workout.
