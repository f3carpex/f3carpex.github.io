After a February full of cold and rain, March comes in like a lamb with beautiful weather in the 60s.

**Warm-Up**

Mosey up the hill towards Laurel Park Elementary and circle up in the parking lot for good mornings, imperial walkers, Sir Fazios forwards, copperhead merkins, copperhead squats, arm twirlies in reverse.

**The Thang** The back of the parking lot has a straightaway that's just perfect for 10-10 sprints. 10 monkey humpers, 10 dry docks, run to the first light pole and back. Repeato to the end of the row and then back down to one. Makers perfect sense to me. Repeato with hand release merkins and prisoner squats.

Partner up for Sora (sorta Dora). One partner runs the pickle while the other partner AMRAPS the exercise. Two rounds of LBCs, two rounds or Homer-to-Marge.

**Mary** Mosey back past the flag to the lower parking lot and circle up for Freddie Mercury, dying cock-a-roaches, box cutters, Homer-to-Marge, cox butters and star plank side crunches.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  17 **Name-a-rama**:  6 RESPECT, 11 meh, 0 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Praises for Bubba's son Dylan and the progress he is making, praises for Tang's grandmother on her recovering from Covid and getting to see her great-grandson this weekend, prayers for WWW's classmate who lost her husband to Covid, prayers for the family in Imp's church whose daughter took her own life recently **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**  A recently vaccinated Old Maid is back in the gloom! Welcome back brother!

No pressure, just three of the most intimidating Qs this region has to offer attending my little workout today.

Before we left the flag Tang made some remark about me not leaving the parking lot. He was kinda right.

There was confusion among the pax during the sprints. Here's a free Q School lesson, if there's ever a misunderstanding about the workout, it's not the Q's fault.

On the way back to the flag we were running downhill, but it was still difficult because we were running Against The Wind. I wise man named Bartman noted there's a Bob Seger song for every situation in life.

Welcome FNG Nothing Special, I'm looking forward to getting to know him better. Make sure you ask him about his name.

Love you guys!
