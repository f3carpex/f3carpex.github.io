Taking the Bounty Hunters creed for the first time so I had to show up strong, right? Harnessing inspiration from a few classic Wu-Tang Clan songs and some old IronPAX legendary exercises, I crafted together 45 minutes of what I hoped would be a challenge for the PAX. To add icing to the cake, quite a few of those in attendance were already complaining about what Triple Lindy did to their rear-ends the day before. They wouldn’t go into much detail and I can only assume why their butts were sore, but Big Red and Ramsay, I’ll pray for you.

After a brief good morning to the crew and the pledge of allegiance to our great nation, we took off on a mosey to say hello to FIA just across the lot. They were already making us look bad, so we ran away quickly with tails tucked between our legs to go warm up.

**Warm Up**

- SSH and Burt Jacks
- Control Freak GM
- Plank with:
    
    - Nolan Ryans
    
    - Plank Jacks
    
    - Runners Stretch
    
    - Mountain Climbers
- 5 penalty burpees for 2 Boy Banders who don’t know how to be on time

**Thang 1: Killa Beez**

PAX lined up on the goal line to complete the Killa Beez:

Broad Jumps x10

Burpees x10

Bonnie Blairs x10

Box Cutters (Oh Shoots) x10

Bear Crawl Merkins x10

We repeated these until we crossed the entire field then did People’s Chair until the six was in. Entire group took a lap together then completed another round of Killa Beez across the field followed by another lap around the field. The morning had started off with plenty of mumble chatter but that quickly faded.

**Thang 2: Solo Dora(ish)**

With time running short, PAX were instructed to perform a solo Dora with 100 Merkins, 100 V-Ups and 100 squats. If at any point you paused or wanted to switch exercises, you took a half-lap around the field. Not sure about the rest of the group, but I never came close to finishing this. I’ve always been terrible at timing and today was no exception.

Everyone circled up for one exercise, TLBCs (tiny, little baby crunches). These are done by getting in the LBC position and pulsing at the top from your knees to halfway back down. They hurt. We did AMRAP on these as each PAX completed one burpee all the way around the circle.

Have a nice day!

Enjoyed the Q and adding that BH sticker to my collection (thanks Pity, although, where were the jorts?).
