DP is a great site and today it was especially nice since the gates were opened before 5:30 am so everyone could park in the lot. Everyone except YHC, as I arrived early to see if the fields were open. In retrospect, I'm glad that I arrived early as it gave me a chance to do some EC with @TermPaper, and after the workout I walked back with @TrackStar.

My plan for the workout today was to stay around the parking lot and do lots of running. The PAX considered this a vanilla work-out and mumbled about it excessively, so I threw in what I considered sprinkles. Basically, this amounted to more / faster running. I hope they appreciate what I did for them, especially those training for BRR.
