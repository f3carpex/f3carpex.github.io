No CARPEx PAX were surprised this morning when YHC made the announcement that today was going to be a low-mileage day. At least not those with access to (and the time to check) Slack. But nevertheless, after both a disclaimer and a reminder that F3 is about building better men and better leaders, there was an opportunity for the gazelles in the audience to make their way to A-team.

Finding that none took the opportunity, "play" was hit on the ol' bluetooth enabled noise box and we proceeded to enjoy some camaraderie while getting a bit of a sweat on.

6" hold on "bring Sally down" --- bring it back up on "bring Sally up"  
YHC saw many a PAX laid waste by this one. Including Ma Bell and Prodigal. Success!

### Thang 2

Over the other playground (with [Smashing Pumpkins "Cherub Rock"](https://youtu.be/q-KE9lvU810) accompaniment) for some tabata

Brought to you by [The Prodigy "Firestarter"](https://youtu.be/wmin5WkOuPw), [Ministry "Stigmata"](https://youtu.be/qxaPj19VnRA), [The Vandals "Don't Stop Me Now"](https://youtu.be/vHAa0zHps2E) and [RATM"Testify"](https://youtu.be/Q3dvbM6Pias)

### Thang 3

Over the the basketball court for the rest of the tabata brought to you by [NIN "Mr. Self Destruct"](https://youtu.be/2nMv6IpJM2A), [Danzig "Mother"](https://youtu.be/Q7KLdET1lBM) and [Massive Attach "Teardrop"](https://youtu.be/u7K72X4eo_s)

- Lunges
- Plank Jacks

Nature Boy wisely called "Time Check!" at which point YHC realized it was 6:14 and time to wrap this up.

### Mary

Um... we had 10 seconds of cool-down. And a few seconds of Have a Nice Day.

### COT:

Count-a-rama: 19

Announcements: Q-source this evening (which as of this writing did not happen... Sorry!). YHC also forgot to announce that SNS will have a Mental Health theme. Check out Slack for more info

Prayers: My BIL Gerkin and his M Gabi are expecting twins. As of this writing, two happy baby girls have entered the world and all is GREAT in the Zerda household. Praises for Moped's anniversary and Doogie's 2.1 (?)'s baptism.

### NMS:

I had a lot more fun putting this together than I should have. It was very much a trip down memory lane. My only regret is that I ran out of time before we got into more of the chill vibes at the very end. I don't know how I thought we would get through a 62 minute playlist in 45 minutes but that's what I planned. BUT!... a thought has occurred for future Q's and I hope to enjoy putting that musical accompaniment together as well.

Really good to have the opportunity to hang together with this group of fantastic guys and dare I say friends.

### Final mileage per the Strava average: 0.39 miles. [_Flyby_.](https://labs.strava.com/flyby/viewer/#2239257365?c=dnrgtb67&z=J&t=1ScA1e&a=FVt4hX5xeYWRW3qF)
