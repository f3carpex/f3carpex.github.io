On "The Slack" when I see Hotspot's week of upcoming Q's. Hmmm. No Q at DZ. That ain't 'bout to happen. Snatched that bad boy up and came up with the plan.

**Warm Up:**

Harder than normal this am since everyone was in their own world conversating. Could not get this bunch of 12 in gear at all. Saben even gave me the eye. Never have I felt so inadequate as a Q. After what seemed like an eternity we got moving. Going to have to work on the motivating presence apparently.

- Lap around the pickle then circle up.
- 20x SSH IC
- 10x GM IC
- 10x WM IC
- 10x MC's IC
- 10x Runner Stretch M'urcans left then switch to right for another 10

The Thang:

Head over to the soccer field rock pile. Partner up and grab a heavy and a medium sized rock. Q fail here. I forgot to come early and pre-heat the rocks so some of the Pax had an uncomfortable time holding the rocks as they were too cold to hold. I'll try to do better.

- P1 Called Rock Work AMRAP
- P2 Run across the field and do 5 Called Exercise come back and switch until 25 total reps are complete per each Pax.
- Set 1 - Overhead Press & Burpees
- Set 2 - Curls & M'urcans
- Set 3 - Triceps Extension & Squats

Finish together and return rocks.

Head down to the playground.

- P1 - Amrap Pullups
- P2 - Run down the stairs to the Volleyball courts and back up.

Flipflop

Back to the flag and circle up.

Burt called a Mary Exercise while I got my phone to take Roll Call
