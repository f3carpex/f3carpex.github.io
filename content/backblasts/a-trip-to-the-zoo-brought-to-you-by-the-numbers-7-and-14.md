Nice warmer weather again this morning brought out 13 of Carpex's finest to the premier skate park in SW Wake County.  YHC tried to solicit some requests for the workout today - didn't get much but decided to work in what I could

530 - time to start - a few still messing around at a truck trying to find a pair of gloves - so the rest of us went over there and did 1 burpee OYO to start.  (Badlands didn't want many burpees).  Then off to the community center with a circle up in the middle area for warm up.  We started with Good Mornings (not so i could hear the famous Nature Boy line)  and we did 14 of them.  Not because 14 was especially important but Squatter was a big fan so it became part of the workout theme.  (We actually did 14 because YHC has a pulled glut muscle and 10 didn't seem to make enough difference.)  Next - 14 Windmills, 14 Imperial Walkers.  We did 10 mountain climbers next - Squatter complained so much that we did another 4 (with no counting help from Nature Boy).  Enough all ready- we were off.

We started by tracing the Odyssey route - out of the community center and over the RR tracks with a lunge walk over the tracks.  Wow - this is a nice parking lot - lets do some quick feet followed by 7s (LBCs and Squats) and then off again on our cultural tour of downtown Apex.  A quick squat hold by the Halle Cultural Center with an advertisement for the following production.  Play and musical - good event for kids ages 4-9 or so.

Next - back across the street for more work.  The exotic animals were out in Apex this morning so in the parking lot - we did Alligator Merkins across - mosey back, following that patter for

Bear Crawl, Crab Walk, Duck Walk, Emu Strut (made up on the spot by Honeycomb), Frog jump, Gorilla hop.

No one could help YHC with an H animal exercise so instead we did two sets of dips and irkins (14 and 7 counts naturally) and headed off down a very dark 10-10 road.  At Hughes street we partnered for catch me if you can back to the community center (2 burpees).

At the community center - we grabbed some bricks (Smokey request) and did 14 rock your body, 14 curls, 14 OH press, 14 tricep ext, and 21 brick rows.

Time was getting short so we returned the bricks and returned to the skate park where we still had time for a brief plank -o -rama (7 or 14 count around) and 28 WW2 situps.

COT - group of 13 was quiet today - no prayer requests.  Several people struggled to get out two announcements about November 17 - Holly Springs Half and Carpex triple down - we were a little shy on the actual details.

YHC took us out.

It was great to be in downtown Apex this morning with such a solid group.  Thank you men for following and for helping me develop a theme workout as it took place.
