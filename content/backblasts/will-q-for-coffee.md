Apex was decorated for Christmas, and YHC thought the PAX would enjoy seeing some of the lights. After moseying through DTA, we stopped at the RR station with the purty Christmas tree, all a-light (see what I did there?).

Warm-up

- Sprinkler
- Windmill
- Steve Earle
- Sir Fazio
- Bonus Burpees

Not to be caught napping, we mosey to our next location. YHC saw a path between buildings that looked okay but turned out to be kinda mucky. God bless those PAX -- they followed me with only minor complaints. We found ourselves in a large parking lot, in front of Apex finest PD. So when we practiced various animal walks across the parking lot, you can be sure we attracted some attention.

Animal walks across the parking lot

- Bear crawl
- Duck walk
- Frog hop
- Crawl bear

Since traffic was picking-up and YHC likes his fellow PAX, he decided to stay in the parking lot. There is a slight incline towards the back of the lot, so we sprinted to the top and did a series of exercises. I think there were star jumps, burpees and jump lunges, but don't quote me on that as its getting late in the day and I've yet to take a nap.

Back through POGL, past the flag and down the hill to CC Jones Park, where there is a little pickle. No, this isn't a personal insult (although it was very little). So we partnered up for some wierd Dora with AH, LBCs, H2M while partner ran around park the long way.

Still 10 mins or so left, so lunge walk/burpee catch me if you can back to the flag. One minute to spare, but the ground was wet and YHC didn't want to be too ruffled for coffeteria, so that's it!

Thanks for putting up with my audibles.
