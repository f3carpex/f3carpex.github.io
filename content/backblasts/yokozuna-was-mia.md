I pulled my first Riptide on my last Q and never wrote the back blast for FMJ where I earned by first Q-zie. I am also hi-jacking one back blast to write about another AO briefly. I feel like I am committing all the sins of Carpex at once...okay I feel absolved for my sins - I said 3 Our Fathers and ran 3 Miles.

Was looking forward to my first Q at Kryptonite and had put some thought into what I wanted to do. Knowing the mileage minimum I felt good about my plan and timing.

4 for EC - Large Mouth, Wonderbread, YHC, and Term Paper

Warm-up: Merkins, SSH, Hill Billies, Seal Claps, Sir Fazio Good Mornings - not in that exact order but I think I got them all - Holy Case of the Mondays

Thang 1: Plan was to run and do first stage of Jack Webb, and then run and do stage 2 and so on. Then Flip Flop is all like "hey you only did one, what are we going to do? start over at every stop?" - This is a brilliant IDEA!!!

Thang 2: We keep running and built on the Jack Webb 1, 1-2, 1-2-3, 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4-5 - and then 6 comes and we do a little detour to another parking lot because why not. so we do 1-5 of Jack Webbs and the 6-10 of Captain Thors, building on each one as we go.

Thang 3: We started to run out of time but we did get through the full build up of Jack Webb's and Captain Thor so all in all we did a lot of merkins, air presses, WWIIs and American Hammers. The real tragedy is that we didn't get to do YokoZuna's - a new exercise that consists of 1 Sumo Squats to 4 SSH.
