By trade I'm a project manager. I always have a plan. But many times, I don't actually finalize Q plans until minutes before the event actually starts. For the FMJ Q today, I must tip my proverbial hat to Suck Up. Unbeknownst to HIM, the plan was nearly finalized while on the playground at Kelly Road park while completing our Memorial Day Murph.

In typical Suck Up fashion, he was smiling a lot and finding ways to talk trash while being super nice. To his credit, Suck Up had checked the Q sheet and noticed none other than WHY-H-SEE had grabbed the coveted post-Memorial Day slot. Being the good site Q that he is, Suck Up was asking about the workout the next day and then asked the fateful question.

"Is there anywhere at FMJ where you can do pull-ups?"

I was fairly certain it wasn't because Suck Up wanted to do more pull-ups. But regardless, at that moment the die was cast. The decision was made. Workout plan ENGAGE.

## Warm Up

At 0530 take inventory of the PAX, give an abbreviated disclaimer and Pledge. Mosey for about a half mile to the parking lot near the school playground (this will be needed soon). Circle up for Good Mornings, Sir Fazio arm circles, Steve Earles, Plank Jacks, Runner's and calf stretch.

## The Thang

Number off in 1s and 2s for 2 groups. At the school playground, do 5 pullups, 10 merkins, 15 squats. At the Salem pond park playground, 5 pullups, 10 merkins, 15 LBCs. Group 1 start at the school, group 2 starts at the park. On the run between, 1 burpee at every street light on the main road.

After each group has been at each side 3 times, meet up on the street and regroup. Mosey back around the track side of the school, pausing for the 6 and doing some LBCs. Continue mosey around the street and back to the flag.

## Mary

American Hammers, Dying Cockroaches and CF Merkins.

## COT

17 total, a few Respects in the crowd. Shutty reminded us of F3 Raleigh's Juneteenth events and told us to read the $#!@ newsletter as everything will be in there. Prayers lifted for Saban's SIL who fell off a ladder, and praises for Imp's 14 years of marriage and 7 years of F3! YHC took us out.

## NMS

- Shutty showed up with no shoes. I hear the mind goes quickly in retirement.
- Suck Up was wearing shorts that were slightly above the knee.
- Water Wings is talking up another F3 boxing event. Rumor is he has a list, and wants to check some names off it.
- There were hidden cameras strategically placed to record exercise form, and citations will be issued if necessary.
- It's official - POGL won the Hill Climb Challenge!
- MIAGD folks!!!
