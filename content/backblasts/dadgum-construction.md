5 pax met up for another round of beatdown in DTC led by yours truly. Weather was hot, but certainly not unbearable at all. Even got to feel some nice breezes to boot. YHC had a plan together with some tempo that would work us and get some good sweat on. Only to find out at the start of the warm up that Town of Cary had some kind of something going on involving, among other things, a giant piece of plastic blocking the path of the first thang that was to take place. But thanks to a simple modification suggestion by Shut-In, the plan was back on track in no time.

- **Run around the police station building to the big fountain:**
- **Good Morning**

We finished up by bringing back the tradition of putting our feet in the fountain.
