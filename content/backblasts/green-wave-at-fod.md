Great morning at FOD -- always a good crowd and fun men to be with! But holy crap the site-q's are doing a terrible job keeping the pollen down.... couple of times it was tough to get the cadence out with a headfull of green dust. That however, did not slow down this fine crew of men! Here's what happened according to my recollection... gather at the flag (someone mentioned it's a bit short, but that's not everything in life, right?), F3 mission, pledge, no FNGs, let's get to:

**Warm up**:

Run up the hill including butt kickers, high knees, etc., warm up circle with good mornings, windmills, hillbillies, sir fazios, seal claps, overhead claps, mtn climbers, planks, merkins, -- good times! Run across to the big pickle for:

**Thang #1:**

21's around the big pickle by 2's. Start at the top with 19 merkins then run down to the bottom for 2 monkey humpers. Next lap is 17 & 4, then 15 & 6, etc. We stopped and dig one burpee halfway in each direction. 100 merkins, 100 humpers, & 20 burpees total. Mosey back down the hill to the pavilion for:

**Thang #2:**

Bench work: Bulgarian split squats, dips, step downs -- couple of rounds. Then mosey back to the flag for mary as the runners & bootcampers rolled in:

LBC's, freddy mercs, homer-to-marge, & plank you very much. Everyone was happy and no refunds were requested.

COT:Numberama: 23 total, 8 respects, 15 meh

Announcments: Look for Freed to Bleed on Slack -- early May

Prayers/praises: None brought forward, YHC took us out with unsaid prayers

NMS: beautiful morning with perfect temps & sun coming up -- so great to be out there with you men! The perfect way to start my day.
