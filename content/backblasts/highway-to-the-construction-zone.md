I had a route all set and ready to go. YHC tends to leave the park for a roundabout journey as of late, so I was excited to walk it down, what with all the greenway closures in the area. I pulled up Strava just to review last week's workout... and Rip beat me to the punch. And it was a more ambitious version of what I had scoped out on Google Maps, so here you go trash can, have a plan!

 

Rolling up to the park today was a bit more circuitous than normal, the type of confusing of which, in the past, has yielded more than a few late arrivals. Figured it would be wise to stay nearby - but again, YHC gets a little antsy hanging out by the cars. So let's use that roadblock to our advantage!

 

I pulled up (for the second time... thanks biology) among 3 bicyclists and felt like I missed the memo. Bike Fridays boutta be a thing.

 

One last walkthrough - FNG Check - Disclaimer - LET'S GO

 

Leave the park and hang a left. Then hang another left at Cary Parkway, and pause for a middle of the street warmup. SSH // GM // IW

Down to the 'true' Road Closed sign at the bottom of the hill to prepare for

 

THANG 1

[Focusing on the 5 street lights, go back up the hill for 3 rounds of Paula Abdul. At each streetlight destination, stop for 10 reps. So that's light #s 2-1-3-2-4-3-5 for a total of 70 reps each round. After the reps at street light #5, back to the bottom to do it again.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xweiQukBM_k)

Round 1 - Merkins // Round 2 - Sumo Squats // Round 3 - Star Jumps

 

Find the greenway and back into the park we go. Pause at the first wall for Erkins // ALRSU // Derkins, then continue to the bridge. Bear crawl the bridge.

 

THANG 2

Count off 1s and 2s. 1s do some Mary exercises whlie the 2s run the loop around the hilly field. Flipflop, repeato, then do the whole thing again.

 

Mosey up the hill back to the shelter for Erkins // Derkins // Dips.

 

Back to the flag for LBCs, Homer to Marge, and HAND. THAT'S IT!

Flipflop read me like a book today and I missed it hard. Props to him for reading backblasts, and for anticipating the Q style. That dude is a solid site Q. Know your AOs!

Good looking out on the Road Closed sign adjustment Burt! #Burt4SafetyQ

Harris Teeter was the real MVP today. I thanked biology earlier, but my true thanks goes to the only consistently trustworthy 24/7 bathrooms across the greater Carpex region.

Not that we covered that much distance today, but the group stayed together through most of everything, which was awesome. I think this was my first Q with single-digits PAX, and it was definitely better for it.

Little bit of PAX choice today - Sputnik asked for some Reverse Plank and Burt wanted some Dips... who am I to deprive the PAX?

Seriously though, I'm like 5 for my last 5 Qs with showing up for a walkthrough and having to leave to find a Teeter. Disruptive.

Thank you all! Had a blast!
