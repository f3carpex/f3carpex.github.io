11 PAX showed up Saturday morning for a pre-Easter workout. No FNGs. Mosey down to the field for the warm-up: Good Mornings, Cotton Pickers, SSHs, Imperial Walkers, Plank Jacks. The rain started. Next, mosey around a 100 yrd x 50 yrd plot, for the thang, marking the corners and mid-field points with pine cones. Note: don't use pine cones to mark a course - they're hard to find.
