So we got lucky on the rain, 10 cool guys showed up and we got after it. Nice slow jog up to a parking lot, did 23 Merkins in honor of my son Gibson, 10 Windmills, 10 Plankjacks and 10 Hill Billies.

Part one was some Fry Daddy 's Speed Racers, 5 Burpess and one lap, 10 Burpees and 2 Laps, 5 Burpees and 3 laps.

Part 2 was slow jog to rock pile, we did curls, rows and tricep extension with some running to a variety of light poles.

Last we did some merkin work and we stopped at each light pole, repeato.

COT announcement for Christmas Party and Sat options for triple down.

 

Prayers for my aunt passing away and to be with my uncle and five cousins. Ann was one special person.

 

I took us out.
