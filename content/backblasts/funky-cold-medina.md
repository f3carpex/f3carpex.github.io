You might ask yourself what the title of this post has to do with the actual post itself. Answer: nothing really. It just happened to be the song YHC rolled up to the AO this morning. And I couldn't think of anythign better. By 05:45 - and  I mean 05:44:59 - 9 other fellers rolled up to see what was about to go down.

**Warm-Up**

Jog around the parking lot then over to the greenway trailhead parking lot for:

- Merkins (of course) IC
- Mountain Climbers IC
- Say Hey Willies IC
- Side Straddle Hops IC

**The Thang 1**

Taking a page out of the FWD playbook called "Leave Park Right" we - you got it - left the park. Just a jaunt up the road to the Lutheran school for some more parking lot fun.

- Jacob's Ladder in the middle parking lot - Merkins on one end up to 14 counting by 2s, 5 CDDs each time on the other. Plank hold and some plank-a-rama when done.
- Jacob's Ladder in the parking lot closest to the school - Air squats on one end up to 7, 10 Monkey Humpers each time on the other. Squat hold with some pulses in cadence when done. Crowd favorite. Who knew?
- Jacob's Ladder up the hill (as Jacob's Ladder should be) leading to the parking lot - LBCs at the top up to 5,  10 American Hammers each time at the bottom. 6 inch leg hold when done, followed by some Flutter Kicks, Hello Dollys, and Box Cutters in cadence. Another crowd favorite.

**The Thang 2**

Jog back to the park into the giant shelter. Grab a table. Set of 20s of the following set:

- Dips IC
- Derkins OMD
- Alt L/R Step-Ups IC (with a clap)

Repeato with sets of 15, 10, and 5

**Mary**

I mean, we have 2 minutes left, so 26 x Table Top Big Boy Sit-Ups OMU and 20 x Rosalitas IC
