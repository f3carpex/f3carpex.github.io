Nine HIMs met up this fine morning to run up and down some hills and play some more with YHC's new CMU's (aka "pain pills"), debuted last Friday in a very soggy Slippery When Wet beatdown. With Hermes' return to duty, mumblechatter has resumed to a healthy banter. And, somehow, we managed to turn about 3.0 miles today, almost all of it up and down one hill or another. Here's what we did.

#### EC

Chipper & YHC departed 0455 for a 3 mile EC loop up and around Waverly, supporting his training for an upcoming Idoit run (is what he called it). Great way to start the day. Yoga Mat trailed with a later start EC.

#### Warm-up

Mosey to the parking lot, clear view from Crossfit... circle up for YHC's standard opener: Good Mornings, Side Straddle Hops, Windmills, Imperial Walkers. Mosey to the hill.

#### Thang 1: Hill Repeat to US-1 & Back

Run up the hill (0.8 mi round trip), stopping at every other light pole for 5 Burpees, run back down. PAX called Mary for the six. It sucked. That's a long hill. Consensus that 4-5 reps of that would qualify for BRR training.

#### Thang 2: CMU 1/2 Dora

Mosey across Tryon to the office lot, bottom of the hill, discover Build-a-Bear's truck, loaded with 38-pound pain pills. Q called a 1/2 Dora (kind of), and it went something like this: do some exercises (mix of Overhead, Rows, Curls, etc.) and when the PAX has had enough, run up the hill. Do that for about 20 minutes. It wasn't textbook, but it worked. Return pain pills to the truck and back up the hill, down the hill and to the flag

#### Mary, COT

Quick Mary with LBC's, Dying Cockroaches, American Hammer and Have a Nice Day. Prayers for Swag's M and Aushfart. Hermes took us out.
