There was no visible pollen at Wolverine on a warm and sweaty Monday morning. There were however 20 PAX passing on the left and hitting the six for an ab-solutely splendid morning!

Warm-up:

- Pledge
- and wait for a just-a-few-seconds late Parker....10 burpees OYO

- Back to your partner at the park.
- First partner does 10 pull-ups, other continuous merkins until tapped, repeat.
- Round 2 is chin-ups and diamond merkins, Round 3 is wide-grip and wide-grip.
- Pulsing Al Gore until all are complete.
- Mosey to the steep slope for partner incline sit-ups. 10 each on YHC's count, then 50 as a team.
- Repeat Indian Run back to parking lot, core of choice every seventh sprinter to the front.
- Watch out for cars.
- Watch out for more cars.
