As we gathered this lovely humid morning in the FOD parking lot, a fresh face sauntered up and introduced himself as an FNG. Apparently @dirtybomb EH'd him, but declined to post himself.

A little small talk, a slightly abridged disclaimer and we were off for a mosey, paint the lines and a quick warm up with side straddle hops, merkins, good mornings, and sir fazio's.

At the bottom of the hill I explained our blimp routine...

Burpee broad jumps to the first light pole, then lunge walk to the next, then run two light poles for imperial walkers, then back to the bottom for some Mary. Repeat each round with the addition of two more light poles and the next exercise (merkins, plank Jack's, and squats). We ended up at the park entrance and completed the squats when sky blue mentioned that the trail around the baseball fields is finally open again. Obviously, we had to take that route, and boy it was worth the 2.5 yr wait!!!!!

Had some time to fill so 3 rounds of alternating step ups, dips, and derkins at the picnic shelter and then time for heels to heaven.

Welcome FNG White Claw who likes to mountain bike and drink beer. He seemed a little disappointed with his name. Must be a Truly fan ðŸ˜Ž
