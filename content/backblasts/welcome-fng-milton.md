Six for bootcamp.  
One for self-inflicted pain.  
13, including an FNG, for dizzying repeats around the track.

**Here's what the campers did:**  
_WARMUP_: Traditional warmup yog around the back of the school. Met up at the speed bumps by the elementary school for some SSHs, Squats, merkins and stretches to complete the warm up.

_ME_: partner up. Starting from the speed bump, P1 runs the pickle one direction and the P2 goes the other direction. Race back to the Start/Finish line. Winner does squats... and loser does the winner's bidding. Repeat.  The catch is that the winner starts where the loser finished, thereby running a bit longer the next time around around. Finish line stays the same. After ~6 repeats, we did one more round as two indigenous people's groups.

_Mary_: dragged the ovaltiners back into the COT for four minutes of Mary: merkins, plank jacks & supermans.. A failed "Fly on the Windscreen" and five burpees finished off the set.

**COT**:

_Announced_ the 1776 Convergence in SCary for July 4th.

_Prayers_ for Happy's Father and his sister; prayers for Biner; prayers for Ma Bell's aunt recovering from heart surgery; prayers/praises for a wonderful weekend in the Life Alert home

**_FNG_**: Milton is in finance. He is an accountant. He works with paper. He probably has a stapler. What's the guy's name from The Office?
