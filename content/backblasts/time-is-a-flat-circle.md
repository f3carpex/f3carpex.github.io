YHC's birthday Q week comes to close at this AO. The Green Mile. Ninety minutes of work and the week is done, on your birthday. Let's get after it.

A little dark, but you get the idea.

They locked the gates to the track. Bastards. There goes the first Thang planned. But like the strategic analyst I am, primary plans always have secondary, tertiary, and tactical options when confronted with obstacles. Not many PAX rolling in this morning as large numbers are siphoned off this time of year due to final weeks of BRR training. We're gonna get some miles in, but not THAT many miles. Two pax, Hi-Liter and Snots, roll out for an 8 mile out and back. That leaves seven studs to stumble through a Repeato Q whose legs are tired, has a belly full of port wine cheese and a 22 oz bone in ribeye courtesy of the Angus Barn the night before, and whose workout creativity has taken a hit over the last five mornings of Qs. Let's see if we can figure it out. First things first, Pledge of Allegiance.

Warm Up: Let's mosey. Head across the vast impervious surfaces of the high school and down to the bus lot. With the track being closed, this is somewhat the next best thing. Get the blood flowing with Good Mornings, Sprinklers, SSHs, Merkins, and Hillbillys. Maybe, I can't honestly remember.

Thang 1: _Circles_ around the buses. Not quite a 400m distance but it'll do. Lunge walk or bear crawl around the curves, and 'more than a mosey' on the straightaways. More than a mosey has a nice ring to it. Not interested in 'All You Gots' at this moment since we just got started. Repeato until we hit a mile on the Garmin.

Thang 2: Mosey back up the hill, up the steps and to the front of the school. Find a spot on the low wall or _circular_ picnic tables. Two sets of varying reps (10, 15, 20) of alternating left right step ups, irkins, dips, and derkins.

Thang 3: Sevens on the steps. From the picnic tables, mosey back down the steps and down the parking lot to the futuristic bike rack. Start with one merkin here, and six burpees at the rack. Go. Pick up the six and then mosey back to the flag for a quick swig-o-aqua if you need it.

Thang 4: Long lap. Leave the parking lot and mosey the long big _circle_ around the school for another mile plus. Pick up the six and rendezvous back at the flag. Almost four mile and still 25 minutes to go before a bit-o-stretching to close out the workout. Crikey.

Thang 5: Mosey back to the front of the school YHC out of ideas and trying to hit 5 miles, mapped out yet another _circle_ around the parking lot and put in laps. Lunges on the curves, more than a mosey on the straightaways. Time check and back to the flag.

Thang 6: Damn it. Still need .12 to hit 5 miles. More _circles_ around the lot it is. BEEP. Thank you.

Thang 7: Good solid stretching _circle_ courtesy of Hi-Liter. Stretches included but were not limited to: good mornings, calf stretches, runner's stretch, pigeon stretch, halloween cat, unmiliked cow, downward dogs, deltoids, triceps, and chicken wings. Yes, all of those are real.

_Circle_ of Trust: Nine pax made it quick. Prayers for parents, teachers, students, and administrators. Local, state, and federal leaders. YHC took us out.

NMS: Well it was a helluva week men. Helluva week. Thanks to everyone for all the birthday messages, cold beers, and attaboys. You bunch of HIMs continue to make YHC a better man. A better husband, father, brother, and son. A better colleague and neighbor. Carpex provides in ways I never would've thought possible when I got out in the gloom that fateful May morning three years ago. What a journey it's been in such a short period of time. The mind reels to thin of where I'll be in three more years. My 36th _circle_ around the sun was great. The 37th is gonna be fantastic.

YHC out.
