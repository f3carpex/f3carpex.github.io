You'll have to keep reading to find out why the title is what it is! Good news for you is that this will be a quick read!

A thin crowd was coming together for F3 as the FIA ladies collected -- they outnumbered us by 3 or 4X! I guess the spring break excuse only applies to the men of F3.... 'nouf said.

6 men started the session with our mission & the pledge. Mosey down the street to the "Academy" for our warm-up which was needed as the cool breeze was quite stiff. Classic warm-up -- good morning, windmill, hill billies, merkins, mtn climbers, etc... then mosey back to the parking lot for:

**Thang #**1 -- jog around the lot, show the PAX "Merkinville", "Burpee Corner", and "Monkey Humperland". We'd be traveling between Merkinville and Humperland for 21's by 2. Start with 2 monkey humpers, get 2 burpees on the way to 19 merkins. Change by 2 each time 4-17, 6-15, etc. Good times with Sliver Fox pacing the field! After that head over to the picnic benches for:

**Thang #2** -- Here's where it gets odd -- I called the usual crowd favorite Bulgarian split squats -- immediately, Steaks declares that he'll be back -- sure is a good thing the site-q's installed a men's room as "human urgency" struck our man Steaks. The exercise will now be called Bulgarian steak squirts..... (maybe not). Anyway, we continued with our split squats and dips for a few sets while looking to see if Steaks was ok in there.... decided to stay put and started our Mary session -- LBC, Freddy Merc, Am Hammer, Homer 2 Marge.... Steaks then made his reappearance & we ran back to the flag right on time!

Number-rama: 6 -- 3 respect, 3 mehs

Announcements: Tomorrow's Danger Zone convergence (3 other sites "closed")

Prayers/Praises: silent prayers, for our PAX recovering : Petsounds, Michelob, How How, etc.

Off we go to Make it a Great Day!
