5 Pax and 1 K9 Pax made it out to another great winter’s evening in downtown Cary.  Or, I guess you could say (un)winter, cause the weather was great and temperatures remained nicely in the 60s pretty much all day.  There may have even been a momentary thought of letting the routine of “feet in the fountain” make a return.  But that’s only for summer time for obvious reasons.  Plus, if this is what winter is going to be like, then we’re definitely going to need that routine when summer actually does arrive…

But I’m digressing, so, on to the workout.

**Warmup:**

**We moseyed through the parking areas of the front lot then stopped to do:**

**Good Evening**

**SSH**

**Sir Fasio Arm Things (forward and reverse)**

**Seal Claps**

**Calf Stretches**

**Plank Jacks**

**Quick Feet**

**Thang 1:**

We slowly made our way around the entire town hall complex by way of Indian run-Catch Me If You Can.  (3 cycles) With last Pax performing 5 **Hand Release Merkins** (cycle 1), 5 **Heels to Heaven** (cycle 2), and 10 **Jump Lunges** (cycle 3).  Each cycle was broken up with **Turkish Getups, and Curb Dips**.

**Thang 2:**

At the Cashpoints machine, we broke into two groups. Group 1 ran to the farthest parking area and did 5 **burpees**, while Group 2 did **BTTW**, then flapjack.  Round two: Group 1- ran to next closest lot, did 10 **Pickle Pounders IC**, Group 2- **BTTW**, flapjack.  Round three: Group 1- Ran through closest lot and did 20 **Prisoner Squats**, Group 2- **Al Gore People’s Chair**, Flapjack.

**Thang 3:**

We had 4 stations around our favorite grassy area.  S1- 10 Pullups and 10 Merkins. S2- **Monkey Humpers**. S3- **LBCs**. S4- **Mtn. Climbers**.  Station 1 was the control station, so when said pax was done at S1 everyone shifted stations till each one was visited by all.

**Thang 4:**

Wall to wall exercises. We went **Dips, Bear Crawls, Box Jumps, Duck Walk** Back.  Repeato with **Derkins, Lunge Walk** across, **Irkins, Backward Lunge Walk** back.
