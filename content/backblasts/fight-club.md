Temps felt warmer than forecasted - a welcomed surprise. 3 for an EC run return in the nick of time. 1 late PAX slides by with no penalty burbees...come on, I'm their guest. Next time, though...

**The Warmup**

\- Mixed run around the parking lot (x2) - BR, Karioke, Paint the Lines - SSH (x34); St. Merkins (x34) -- then the PAX realized there was a theme...the theme was YHC's 34th day of posting in a row -- Good Mornings (x15); Annies (x34); LBC's (x34); Flying Sun God's (x20) - Run to the nearby gloomy double basketball courts
