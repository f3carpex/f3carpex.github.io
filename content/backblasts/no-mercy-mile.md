Pro tip: Write your BB as soon possible. This saving them up for the end of the week thing is for the birds. And not that much unlike my struggle to remember what I was doing about 30 hours ago the Exicon provided a doozy of a workout involving the track. I rarely post, or Q for that matter, where there is a running track so I made the most of this opportunity. While I had planned this the night before I really had a right mind to do something else when I woke up because I was that intimidated by this particular track workout. But alas, with the strength of my F3 brothers around me we took it on anyway.

Warm-up: Steve Earle, Nancy Kerrigan, Cotton Picker, Dive Bombers, Good Mornings

Thang1: The No Mercy Mile: Complete 4 laps performing the following: Bear Crawl from turn 1 to turn 2, 25 Merkins half way down the back stretch, Lunge from turn 3 to turn 4, 25 squats upon completion of lap 1. Repeat 3 more times.

Now we did this a little differently because we partnered up at the beginning not to share the load but to keep each other accountable to working hard and staying encouraged through this mile of pain. It worked. There wasn't more than 100 yards between the front runners and the 6 by the end.

Thang 2 / Mary: On the basketball court, Partner 1 does an exercise while P2 runs a suicide drill, then flapjack. Three rounds of this with the exercises being: J-Lo, Shakeria, Superman pulses.
