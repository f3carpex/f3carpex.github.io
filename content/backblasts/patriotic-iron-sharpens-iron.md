**Workout Date:** 04/29/21  
This is my third Carpex Q of the week (and fourth overall) as I try to force myself back into a regular posting schedule. This is also my third Cornerstone Church Q of the week, a great site for the no run/low run/coupon crowd. Like the pull up bars I had incorporated yesterday, the cinder blocks were on my mind for today.

**Warm Up:**  
Give the mission statement, check for FNGs, give the disclaimer, and warm up:  
Whoops! Bolton says, “What about the Pledge?” Pledge of Allegiance

Good Morning x10 IC  
Imperial Walker x20 IC

**Main Event**  
**1)** **7-11s** between start and the second light pole: Elevens (WW1s and Burpees) with 7 LBCs each time through the middle.  
**2)** Grab cinderblocks and partner up for **Catch Me If You Can** around the parking lot. Moseying partner carries a block in each hand. Chasing partner alternates between 5 merkins for the first catch and 10 squats for the second catch. Continue for two or three laps, pick up the six.
