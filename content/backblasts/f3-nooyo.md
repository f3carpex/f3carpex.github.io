One day after a heavy morning across Carpex and F3 Nation c/o #F3MentalBattle, YHC thought the pax needed some good ole fashioned BO fellowship.

But, before that 3 (YHC, Burt and Old Maid) for EC around DTC, and wait a 4th arrives at the end as well. What up, Term Paper?

As for the ME, we set out to do some Strava art (and YHC got the pax in on it early... smart strategy).

Warm-up: Down Academy street and circle up for GM, SSH, SFAC and M. Phelps

The Thang: Classic pearls on a string with J-Webbs, but a twist this morning.

- 1-4, 2-8, 3-12 etc... w/ Merkins and Hallelujahs
- 1-4, 2-8, 3-12 etc... w/ WWII and Dying Cockroaches
- We did this all the up to 10-40 on both sets, and we mixed in some other calisthenics along the way including squats, quick feet and curb merkins
- Before closing it out it was an alternate light pole bear crawl and lunge combo with merkins and squats at every-other pole

Back to the lot for Mary and the artwork was complete. Strava [here](https://www.strava.com/activities/2246524319).

COT: 12 pax, YHC took us out with prayer for the pax and the extended Liuzzo family

NMS:

- Love you guys
- Make it a great day
