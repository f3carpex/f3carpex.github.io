Great to have FNG Farm Boy (Joel) join us. Also good to have The U back in the gloom and welcome The Noid visiting us again from PA.

YHC took us out with a quote from Neil Gaiman

> "I hope that this year, you make mistakes. Because if you are, then you are trying new things, learning, living and pushing yourself. You’re doing things you’ve never done before, and more importantly, you’re doing something.”
