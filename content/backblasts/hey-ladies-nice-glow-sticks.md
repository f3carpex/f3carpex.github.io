Dear PAX,

So after weeks of hype, I hear yall crawled around on a field lit with glowsticks and played crabwalk soccer? Did you all get trophies, too, when you were done?  Isn't that special.

If you need some hand holding or a breeze up your skirt, I'm sure FWD or FOD is just right for you. Posting 9.26.17 at 0530 at Salem Park gets you only one thing: an ass kicking.  You've been warned.

Yours truly,

@f3\_fmj
