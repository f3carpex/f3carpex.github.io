YHC continued my tour of the AOs, which formed this PAX by traveling south to the Wolverine. One of my first times posting here, Hi-Liter had the Q, and YHC wanted to pay a good memory to that HIM with this beatdown. 

Warm Up:

Mosey to the Basketball courts (allowing for a slight detour on a sidewalk which leads to nowhere, thanks Cary).

15 Windmills (Faster windmills than they cared for according to the MC from the PAX)

15 Imperial Walkers

5 Burpees

ATMs: 15 Alternating Shoulder Taps IC, 10 Tempo Merkins, 10 Merkins

The ME:

YHC wanted to get the PAX as many miles as we could during our beat down, and as such we started a Merkin Mile (Plus some other fun things). Set around the track at the Wolverine, the PAX were to complete a set number of reps of an exercise, run to the next corner for the same number of reps but a different exercise. 

First Round was:

25 Hand Release Merkins

25 Diamond Merkins

25 T Merkins

25 Standard Merkins

Meeting back at the basketball courts, the PAX plank held for the 6.

Second Round:

25 Jump Squats

25 Burpees

25 Jump Lunges

25 Squats

Squat Held for the 6

Third Round:

25 Freddie Mercury’s in Cadence (The PAX complained that it was actually 75)

25 LBCs 

25 WW2s

25 Heels to Heaven 

6 Inch Leg hold for the 6

Final Round (Abbreviated due to time constraints): 

25 Standard Merkins

25 T Merkins

25 Diamond Merkins 

COT
