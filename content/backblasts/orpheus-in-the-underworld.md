Build-a-Bear relinquished his Q yesterday. I assume he built a submarine, so that he could run up and down the continental shelf. YHC was glad to step in.

2 for EC (Oofta and Staubach) and 2 for 10-Mile ECME (Lookout and Chops).

Mosey the long way to Lowes Foods parking lot.

**Warm-Up.** Lots of stretching, inspired by (our boy) Bluewater last week.

**Thing 1: Santa's Ladder**

From the Exicon: "Pick a spot in the distance. Run from your starting point to that spot and do 10 Burpees. Return to start. Turnaround, run back to your spot, now do 9 Burpees. Continue this running and rep routine, downward counting through to completing 6 burpees. Then, as you hit the 5-1 count reps, do Merkins instead of Burpees. After the entire 10-1 set is over, pause. Make it appear you're done. Then announce that you're reversing the order. In this new set, now you start with Merkins as your 10-6 set and finish with Burpees as 5-1."

I chased Body Weight, Just One, and Piergoi the whole time.

**Thing 2: Bearmuda Triangle**

From the Exicon: "3 markers ~30yds apart in shape of a triangle. Pax performs one burpee at first marker and bear crawls to 2nd marker, 2 burpees and bear crawl to 3rd marker, 3 burpees and bear crawl back to 1st marker. Rinse and Repeat. Named Bearmuda Triangle as it has been known to mysteriously lose some pax along the way."

Slight modifications - merkins at the corners, and the second round was a squat walk.

Like Orpheus climbing out of Hades, I led the way and tried not to look back. I have a feeling we didn't get 100% participation on the ol' Bearmuda Triangle, but it was all behind me, so I'll never know.

**Mosey back the long way to the flag. Mary. COT:**

- Jump on the Q sheet.

- Still time to register to vote.

Welcome FNG Aquafresh (wearing a Colgate University shirt).

I take us out. Prayers for a dignified debate.

**NMS:**

Glad to see Nature Boy and Pierogi on this side of town. Both of those guys make every workout more fun.

Enjoyed meeting Body Weight. Dude's a machine.

Some peace on debate day, here's The Commish conducting an orchestra (fast-forwarded to the good part):
