Twenty HIM showed up on a cold morning for YHC's second Dante's Peak Q.  For my first Q we stayed on the main side of the park and did burpees.  Lots and lots of burpees.  More than once I was reminded that there was more to the park than the baskeball court.  Today I decided we should stretch our legs and make our way over to the other side.

**Warm-Up**

Throw everyone off guard at the start by heading over to the basketball court for a warm-up that included side straddle hops, imperial walkers, burpees and Sir Fazio arm circles.

**The Thang**

Hustle over to the other side of the park via Bear Crawl Bridge (watch out for those leaves, they're slippery) to the pond and partner up for Dora.  100 merkins, 200 squat jumps, 300 LBCs while your partner takes a lap around the pond.

Hustle over to the ampitheater, P1 BTTW while P2 runs to the first wall for 10 dips, flap-jack.  Repeato with people's chair and 10 step-ups at the second wall, BTTW with 10 irkins at the third wall, finish up with people's chair and 10 step-ups at the fourth wall.  The PAX wisely chose to modify as needed because that fourth wall is a little too high for step-ups.

**Mary**

Hustle back to the flag via Mosey Bridge (the name of the bridge changes depending on the direction you're headed and how tired the Q is) and circle up for various PAX calling American hammers, dying cock-a-roaches, one-legged Homer to Marge, boat-canoe and windsheild wipers.

**COT**

**Count-a-rama**: 20 **Name-a-rama**: 3 RESPECT,S 16 mehs, 1 HATE **Prayers / Praises**: Prayers for Crimson's friend Annette who's in the hospital dealing with multiple issues and needs a miracle to go home again, praise for Blue and Out's friend Ray who had a successful bone marrow transplant, and prayers for him as he will be isolated while he recovers, prayers for Earhart and his M as they travel to Mexico next week, prayers for people from Sooey's hometown who went through destructive storms this week. **BOM**: YHC took us out

**NMS**

YHC apologizes to anyone who posted expecting 100+ burpees.  It's coming, be patient.

Hot Spot invited the PAX to join him on a run before and after the workout, but his jogging pace is my Billy run pace so I passed.  Come out to Bradford's Ordinary and join us for the #meowmile instead.

Dante's Peak is quickly becoming one of my favorite places to post and Q.  The park is big and beuatiful, it's well-lit, and there's ton of things to do there.  It also gives me a chance to post with some of the Apex guys I don't see that often.  I can't wait to come back.
