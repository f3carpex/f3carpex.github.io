QIC: Oofta

On his way to BiB this morning, Pierogi began following a silver Prius with an F3 sticker on its back bumper. Piergo assumed he'd follow this Pax right into our parking lot. Not so! The Prius took the turn immediately _before_ ours and headed into a separate Koka Booth parking lot.

3 for EC (Hermes, Oofta, Francois).

Great crew of 15 for the ME.

Mosey to the rock pile.

Rock workouts / running the pickle.

Mosey to Koka Booth main lot.

Catch me if you can / sprints.

Mosey to the lake, where we find the silver Prius parked. No sign of the owner.

Dips / Urkins / Step-ups at the Koka Booth pavilion.

Back to the flag.

COT. Announcements (F3 Dads Saturday, Carying Place Sunday). Prayers (Snip, Chipper). Oofta takes us out.

NMS:  
I can't believe there's an F3 brother in South Cary who is crazy enough to go for a 5:15 Koka Booth run, but posts infrequently enough that we don't recognize the car.

Best of luck to our Q as he heads to Arizona for a month.

Next week: 20 degrees colder. One hour darker. Build-a-Bear. HC.
