Another moist morning in Carpex, and Open Concept has brought us an FNG named Tom. Give him the disclaimer, turn on some Bob Seger and let's get started.

**Warm-Up** It's Tin2Iron and we can't mosey, so circle up and do five burpees to reduce the chatter, Sir Fazios, more burpees to welcome late arrival Charmin, imperial walkers, cherry pickers, copperhead merkins and squats, and One Big Crimson Good Morning.

**The Thang** Grab a coupon and line up at the first island for 11's, coupon curls while walking down to the next island for squats, overhead presses while walking back for rows.

Partner up for Sorta Dora, 100 coupon squats, curls presses and triceps extensions while your partner bear crawls down to the next island and lunge walks back.

MAN DOWN! (more to come in the NMS)

**Mary** Put the coupons back and circle up for Mary, finishing up with more burpees for Two Factor's tardiness and a disturbing lack of tank tops.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  17 **Name-a-rama**:  9 RESPECT, 8 meh, 0 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for everyone travelling this weekend, prayers for healing for Stitches. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**  Our FNG Tom/Stitches took a pretty good tumble during bear crawls. When he got up a spot over his eye was bleeding. Several HIMs jumped into action. Kidney Stone, WWW, Trike, Two Factor and Open Concept (maybe more) grabbed first aid kits and patched him up. I was expecting him to walk back to his car, drive off in his car and never look back, but Stitches and his medical team joined us for the end of Mary, and it sounds like he'll be back again soon. Keep an eye out for him!

Love you guys!
