On the last Monday in September in 2014, YHC was privileged to be an FNG at an A-Team workout. Today, YHC took the opportunity of his anniversary to repeat his inaugural F3 workout, this time as the Q, just as I did on the last Monday in September 2015 and 2016. Following the first time I participated in this workout (under the leadership of Denali), I couldn’t raise my arms above my head for 3 days and couldn’t walk properly for 6 days. However, on the 7th day, I repeated my attendance at A-Team and have been coming ever since. I can truly say F3 has changed my life. Thanks to all of you. The following is Today’s workout – virtually identical to the past three years. 22 PAX (19 for A-Team plus 3 for rolling stone - Bartman, Banjo, MaBell) (27 PAX in 2016, 19 PAX and 1 dog in 2015, 7 PAX in 2014)  shook off the weekend with an early morning work-out at Apex Community Park. Let’s see what they did: – Mosey from the front entrance to the back parking lot - This was the first time in 4 years that the gate was closed on this date so we got to add mileage today. – Circle up for warm-up (SSH, Good Morning, Mountain Climber, Peter Parker, Low Plank Hold – 3 count around the circle) – Mosey to the pavilion (Dips, LR Step-ups, Incline Merkin, Star-jumps – 15 times each) x2 – Mosey to the tennis courts (11s – Merkins/Star-Jumps) – Mary (Do it in the middle of the work-out – Confusion) – LBC, Low Slow Flutter, and Dying Cockroach - 15 times each – 11s (Prisoner Squats/LBCs) – Mosey to the rock pile. Grab a rock. (Curls, Overhead press, and Triceps extensions – 15 each, then 10 each, then 5) –

– We ended the workout with an Indian Run back to the front parking lot followed by 15 WW 2 situps – just because COT – Announcements – Sosa’s brother looking for contractors willing to work in the Caribbean for a while, Odyssey upcoming October 7, new AO – Full Metal Jacket – launches tomorrow at Salem Park – 5:30 Prayer Requests – Hot Spots grandmother passing – prayers for family gathering to celebrate/ mourn YHC took us out in prayer.

Naked Moleskin: § The 2014, 2015 and 2016 version involved the University of Kentucky winning an SEC football game the weekend before – not a surprise that this streak has come to an end. § Denali and Grease Monkey – this was the first Franklinaversary that you have missed – it wasn’t the same without you

- MaBell, Bartman, Michelob and Billy – this was the third Franklinaverary for each of you.

Thank you. It is my pleasure to lead and to know each of you.
