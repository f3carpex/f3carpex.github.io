I showed up to Tortoises not knowing who the Q was because no one signed up. As I waited for the PAX, I got worried there for a moment if it would be a no show because it was 0528. Then Hotty Toddy, Intimidator and Bubba rolls in just in the knick of time with the shovel flag.

We got the F3-admin stuff out of the way and now it time for business. Slow mosey around the pickle and then for some warm-up. GM, Sir Fazio, and runners stretch.

To make things more interesting, we got some friends to carry along. Yup, you guessed it, the title gave it away. I handed out some paver bricks (2) to each PAX and I told them to build that strong relationship with their new friend.

We slow moseyed (walked) to the hill for some 11s. Burpee manmakers and curls.

Once we accomplished thang 1 as a group, we slow moseyed to the wall for some wall work,

Peopleâ€™s Chair 10 count down and up the line. Recover.

Back into PC and do Wonderbra. Recover.

Back into PC for some more curls.

Mosey back to the flag. Put the bricks back into the truck and circle up to do some global warming with PAX favorite at every stop. Have a nice day.
