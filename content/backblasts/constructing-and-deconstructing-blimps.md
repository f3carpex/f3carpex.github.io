14 HIM gathered at the well-lighted Apex Nature Park to start their weeks off right. Started with a brief jog into one parking lot (where the PAX got a little confused as Hot Spot broke off from the group for his solo run through the woods) for the warmup (SSH, Good Mornings, Sir Fazio Arm Circles, Overhead Clap, Mountain Climbers, Cotton Pickers).

Mosey across the street to the larger parking lot to construct (and deconstruct) some BLIMPS (5 Burpees, 10 Lunges, 15 Imperial Walkers, 20 Merkins, 25 Plank Jacks, 30 Squats) as follows.

Final count - 55 burpees, 100 lunges, 120 IWs, 120 Merkins, 100 plank jacks, 60 squats (+ extras while waiting for the six on each rep), 2 miles of running.Â Great job everyone. It was tough, but everyone got through it together.

Prayers for Chappy's friend Mike, whose brother passed away, Yogi on healing and his job search, Hot Spot and his daughter dealing with the stress of having/being a new driver, Praises for Theisman on his pending new house and prayers for job search.

Keeping the PAX together really makes the 45 minutes go by quicker, even when it sucks.

There were a lot of admirers for Coxswain's new beard

Apparently Mississippi has daddy issues

Hot Spot reminded everyone to sign up to Q. Otherwise, he and his bum shoulder will lead us all on 5-mile runs everyday.
