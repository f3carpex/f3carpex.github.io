A perfect 10 showed up on the coldest morning of the year.

**Warm-Up** Mosey to the bottom lot for warm-up, including Sir Fazio arm circles, done Clockwork style, and a few burpees to calm the chatter.

**The Thang** Mosey across the street to the little hill for sevens, burpees at the bottom, bear crawl up, jump squats at the top, mosey back down.

Mosey back across the street to the picnic tables for Dora. 100 derkins, 200 dips, 300 step ups, run to the dumpster and back.

Count off 1s and 2s, 1s balls to the wall while 2s knock out 20 merkins, flip flop and repeato with peoples chair and copperhead squats.

**Mary** Circle up at the flag for Mary ending with burpees because Frisco was late and Mr Safety was later.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  10 **Name-a-rama**:  4 RESPECT, 5 meh, 1 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for those who have lost jobs recently, prayers for those struggling with addiction and those who love them **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**  Tortoises has gotten too fancy, with all the kettle bells and tires and pull-up bars. I remember the good old days when it wasn't much more than a parking lot and some dudes looking to make each other better. So today's workout was an Old School no frills limited run beatdown like the good old days.

It was great to see new papa Hotty Toddy back in the gloom. He's still a HATE, so his first post in three months didn't seem to bother him.

Sooey called the copperhead squats for the 1s and felt they did a poor job of counting and called Bonus Burpees. Then YHC called Bonus Burpees for the 2s for just standing there while the 1s did their burpees.

There's a reason I chose Frisco as my Dora partner, he's an accountant so he's good with numbers, and I always demand an accurate count from my Dora partners.

On a day when the temperature is below freezing and the wind is howling, ten minutes after we finished most of the men were still standing around in the parking lot talking to each other. We didn't even have coffee, we were there just because we love each other. This brotherhood we share is special, let's not take it for granted.

Love you guys!
