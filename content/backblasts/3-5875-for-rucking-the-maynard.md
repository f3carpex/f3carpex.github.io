Three of us gathered at SNS start point at 0330 to get out and ruck the May May. For all three of us, it was our VRTM although Slappy had previously run the Maynard. We waited a bit for Bartman, who had been a HC the night before. A quick disclaimer, and it was 0333. I had a perfect song queued up, thinking that we'd be leaving at either 0334 or 0335 - in reference to the classic Chicago hit, "25 or 6 to 4." Not wanting to be late to complete the RTM, we headed out of the parking lot and performed the following

Right on High House

Left on Maynard

Left on High House

Left back into the parking lot

We did pick up Bartman right before the midway point - he fought off the evil Dr. Fartsack, parked at SNS at 0400, took a shortcut through DTC and met us right by the McDonald's. We only took a brief pause at the water tower for refreshment and for me to treat a blister. We were hoping to make it to Chatham Street before getting caught by the running May Nerds, but Shawn D. Claire caught us about a click shy of Chatham. We had great conversation underway, got to know more about each other, and generally had a great time while getting some strong mileage in.

Some half-assed Mary at Spit Shine's VQ of SNS, and then a combined COT with 50 PAX.

Can't wait to get out there and RTM again in the near future!
