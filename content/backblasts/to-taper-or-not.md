What is this thing that is called the BRR taper? 13 men showed up at Thomas Brooks park, the site of Field of Dreams, to find out. Four were doing some EC pull-ups before the bell rang at 0545. No site Qs, no flag, let's go.

## Warm Up

Mosey lap, circle up. SSHs, Sir Fazio arm circles, Steve Earles, Runners stretch, Calf stretch, Pigeon stretch, and CF Merkins

## The Thang

Pick a non-traveling rock. Gather at the parking lot entrance. We will do a set of 20 reps of a rock exercise, followed by running to the 2nd light pole, 3rd light pole, and 4th light pole, respectively, for a different core exercise at each pole. Run back, complete 3 sets of each exercise before switching. The exercises were:

- Rock curls and LBCs x 20
- Rock squats and Dying Cockroaches x 20
- Rock press and Side plank star crunches x 10

Running out of time we do one set of Rock rows and 5 or 10 pullups

## Mary

American Hammers and Hello Dollys

## COT

13 total. Some respects, the rest Mehs

Prayers for Callahan as he recovers from a burst appendix and surgery, Jake as he heads in for surgery, and Pom Pom's 2.0 as he completes his pilot training. YHC took us out.
