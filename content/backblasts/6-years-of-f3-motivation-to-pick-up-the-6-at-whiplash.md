Thank you to Wonk and CK for the F3 introduction 6 years ago, its been a complete game changer. From those early Merlot days \[months\] and the #HIM that picked up this 6, things have not really changed that much. “Picking up the 6” and “Leaving no man behind” is still a thing. And though we may have swapped positions, the #HIM we surround ourselves with each am continue to make a difference; in our lives, our families, and communities. And for that, I am thankful.

4 for coffeeteria; Flip Flop, Manram, Michelob and YHC

- Banana Seat – was smoking with those double leggings. Bruh?
- Burt – Thanks for the reminder about that [Kentucky win over Va Tech.](https://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=401135283) You were rocking that 80’s retro UK gear.
- Chanticler, hate you are injured, but I’ve enjoyed this new Chanticler fellowship pace
- Curves, left early so M could open the Raleigh [BURN](https://fianation.com/) unit.
- Flip Flop, [this BB would have been much better with him at the keyboard, just take my word.](https://f3carpex.com/2019/09/30/whats-your-kryptonite-part-ii/)
- Frey Daddy, not sure I heard a word from our site Q
- Honey Do, as Burt promised, limited run. Me believes Burt will have some credibility issues
- Man Hands, sneaky bastard, quiet and imposing, almost pushing the pax, from a back seat to Slater
- Manram, enough about those aches and pains. Work it out and keep gettin’ after it.
- Michelob, ….crickets
- Midget for Life, expecting those fancy Ranger panties and instead got quiet and reserved. Whassup?
- My Pleasure, lots of MC about YHC’s lack [PUT6 etiquette](https://f3nation.com/). Got pissed and left or Q’d Ambassador?
- Pluffy Mud, this Savannah transplant gettin’ after it one month into his F3 membership.
- Regal Beagle, you are an inspiration to us all
- Slater, my [Smokey Mountain Relay](https://smokymountainrelay.com/) partner was crushing it. This man has [#DES](https://f3carpex.com/epic/) on his mind.
- Shut In, Nan’tan making the rounds, thanks for the support.
- Soul Glo, expected my [SMR](https://smokymountainrelay.com/) partner to take off, but hung with the pax. #HIM
- Wonderbread, I see [Ultra trail](http://pm2hrultras.com/) run in your future.
