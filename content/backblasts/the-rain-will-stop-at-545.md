15 Pax made it out to a wet and wild time at FC. Beaker and Sub EC ran to FOD and back. Site Q Sky Blue did an EC shovelflag drop off them met Franklin at the airport for some #WorkF. Goose was out too so no Site Qs but the flag still stands!

As guys gather before the bell rings the rain was picking up and so was the wind. YHC said he saw it would stop at 0545. Well, as soon at it struck 0545 the rain tapered off drastically! Disclaimer was given, the allegiance was pledged, and then the rain came back.

Disclaimer, YHC didn't say it wasn't going to come back! He just said it was going to stop at 545!

Lap around the bus loop led us to the breezeway for a nice dry warm--nope keep running! Warm up _next to_ the breezeway!
