When you arrive at Tortoises early you have to join Theismann in ECPs. Spartan, MaBell, Red Ryder and Theismann were already knocking them out, so I did a couple sets with them.

I had prepared music to last 52 minutes, so at 5:23am the mellow piano of Floyd Cramer (playlist is below) greeted the 29 PAX as they stumbled in from the gloom. At 5:30 we moseyed over to the front lot, circled up and did:

- 5 Good Mornings
- 8 SSH
- Sir Reginald Fazio Arm Circles (make them bigger) x10 forward x10 backward
- Alligator Merkins x8
- Staggered Hand Merkins, x5L, x5R
- Peter Parker Merkin (bring leg in on down) x8
- Carolina Drydock x8
- LBCs x10
- Finger Tip Merkin x8
- Knuckle Merkin (knerkin) x8
- Hand Clap Merkin - Clerkin x5
- Freddie Mercury x10
- Travolta Merkin (on up, hand out, then touch knee) x8
- Copperhead Merkin (slow on down 4 count) x5
- Michael Phelps
- Twerkin (down dog, go under fence) x8
- Merkin wipes (touch nose to R/L hands) x8

_Somewhere in the middle the PAX began to catch on that the pre-blast promise of Merkins and Music meant ALL The Merkins._

On the curb:

- Round the clock merkin (rotate 90 degrees every 5) = 20
- Irkin x8
- Derkin x8

Mosey over to top of hill by handrails, and with a partner:

- Booyah! Merkin - touch partner’s shoulder x5
- Partner Clap (alternate hands) x5
- Partner Derkin - one planks, other merkins feet on back x5, flip-flop
- Squerkin (one does squat, other does merkin) x5, flip-flop
- P1: Double Merkin Burpee x3 + Catalina Wine Mixer until partner returns; P2: Australian Pushups/Pullups x10

Headed over to the lower lot to pick up a coupon and with partner flip-flop three times:

- P1: Blockee (merkin on block) x5 + Rock Your Body Until Partner returns
- P2: Mosey to Flag,  10 Wide Merkins (werkins)

**Circle Up for more Thangs & Mary:**

- Diamond Merkins x10
- Merkin/Superman x10
- Low Slow Flutter x10
- Dying Cock-a-roach x10
- WWIIs x10
- Hand Release Merkins x8
- The Bruce (stacked feet merkin) x8 both sides
- Hotty: Pickle Pounder x10
- Theismann: Australian Snow Angel x10
- Chinese Downhill: some core exercise
- Standard Merkin x28
- Frisco: American Hammer x20
- WWW: Boat/ Canoe x10
- 100’s
- Earhart: Ranger merkin (at ribcage) x10
- Yogi: Prisoner Squat
- Pickles: Alternating pace merkins x10
- Red Ryder: World’s Worst Merkins x5 OYO
- Have a Nice Day

That makes a total of at least 305 merkins of various types. If you did a lot of Catalina Wine Mixers while waiting for your partner to return you can up that number.

29 PAX Continued prayers for Ausfahrt at Big Wake - please go visit him. You may be able to smuggle in food & drinks. He’s got a long recovery ahead of him.

Yogi took us out. He praised the HIM present and prayed for those with Cancer.

**NMS**  
When you search for ‘merkin’ in the F3Nation.com list of exercises you get about 42 different types of merkins, not counting merkins as part of a set (like when merkins are part of a DORA). We did 30 different types of merkins today. Pickles reminded me that we missed scorpion merkins. I didn’t want to try one armed merkins. Some we didn’t qualify for (berkins on bricks), some in the exicon/exercises were variations of others (a sphinx merkin is similar to the Catalina Wine Mixer). The PAX were up to the challenge today.

It was a pleasure to lead today and to share my 58th birthday with y’all. Your continued push and support is a source of constant encouragement.
