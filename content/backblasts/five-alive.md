No better way to kick off National Buttermilk Biscuit Day than in the gloom with my brothers.

**Warm-Up** Mosey to the front of the school and circle up for imperial walkers, Sir Fazios, daisy pickers, copperhead merkins, copperhead squats and control freak Good Mornings.

**The Thang** Mosey to the bottom of the hill next to the parking deck for Five Alive. Five rounds of 5 burpees, 10 merkins, 15 squats, 20 dry docks, 25 LBCs with a quick trip up and down the hill.

Mosey to the upper deck and travel across the lot alternating bear crawls and lunge walks.

Grab some curb for three rounds of Quack Feet and curb merkins.

**Mary** Mosey back to the flag and circle up for pax called Mary, including Big Red's new exercise the Red Out.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  15 **Name-a-rama**:  6 RESPECT, 9 meh, 0 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for Frisco and his family, for Ma Bell and his recovery, for the young men and women graduating (and getting on the road) this weekend. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS** 

It's so good to see guys like Hotspot, Traffic Cone and Yoga Mat back in the gloom!

It's so good to have BOM back in the gloom!

Be on the lookout for Big Red's Red Outs, coming soon to an AO near you.

National Buttermilk Biscuit Day is not powerful enough to make Sooey switch from Starbucks to Bojangles.

Three for good coffee and great conversation at Bojangles, thanks Traffic Cone and Yoga Mat.

Love you guys!
