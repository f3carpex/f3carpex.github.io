We began the workout bright and early with a strong showing of 25 HIM's. The weather was cold and damp but none of us regretted leaving the cozy fartsack for a morning of hard work and fellowship.

Another short mozy down "Powerline hill". 7's Burpies at the top and Merkins at the bottom. Phew what a workout.
