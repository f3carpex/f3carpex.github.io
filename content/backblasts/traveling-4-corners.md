I try to do a 4 corners themed workout every year around tournament time and this year was no different. Props to Chipper for picking up on it

Epic BTTW last man standing battle between Grease and Lipstick, with Lipstick eventually prevailing.

Penguins were a big hit and may be my new signature move.

Awesome to see Joe Smith back in the gloom.

Thanks to all of the South Wake men who ventured up to Carpex. They represented 3 of the 4 EC guys if you include Peeping Tom, who has migrated North

Always an honor to lead
