It was so hot, I thought we were at Dante's Peak....then I realized I only drove 2 mins to the AO....not 20 mins.

The Insomnia extra credit boys (Large Mouth, Hermes, Callahan, Pet Sounds and PBX) came running follow my Mr. Rucker (Bartman) as we circled up to get started.  Nice work men.

73 degrees, feels like 88, clear, no wind.

Theme for today was baseball given the 2nd F Bulls outing on Sunday.    As we waited to get started YHC hit a few grounders to the PAX while the Vespers (10) runners get ready to roll with Banjo at the helm.

No FNGS.   Kotters Malpractice (MP) and RedDawn (RD) were back.  Good to have you back guys.
