Three met at 4:45 (GTL/Denali/Largemouth) for a few EC lake laps and got the sweaty slogfest started.  With adequate time left for a shoe change #Denalisignaturemove, the rest of the PAX gathered.  5:15 a.m. on the clock so we mosey to the big parking lot.  

**Warm up**

15 Imperial Walkers

15 Side shuttle hops

5 Good mornings

15 standard merkins

15 Mountain Climbers

Next up is a favorite of YHC, the BLIMPS circuit.  It keeps a high-tempo feel and works most muscle groups.  Mumblechatter is key since the exercise counts are OYO, and this group is plenty entertaining this morning.
