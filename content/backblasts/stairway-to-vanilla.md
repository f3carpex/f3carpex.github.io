YHC had a plan that involved climbing the stairs in the woods when I Q'ed here at Danger Zone a few weeks ago. Alas the rains the night before left things too slick, and that plan had to go into my back pocket for another day. Well this week it has been dry as a bone, so today is that day.

**Warm-Up**

Quick trip around the pickle and circle up for side straddle hops, hillbillies, Sir Fazios, plank jacks and one standard merkin.

**The Thang**

Mosey down into the park to the patio and partner up, nothing matters. Partner one runs up the stairs, does five irkins on the wall, and runs back down. Parter two alternates ten derkins and ten squats. Flapjack and repeato until both partners have climbed the stairs twice.

Repeato with star jumps at the top and alternating dips and LBCs at the bottom.

Repeato with irkins at the top and alternating derkins and squats at the bottom.

Mosey back up the stairs and out to Cary Parkway. This section is closed to traffic while they work on the bridge at the bottom of the hill. Plenty of room for a little five and dime. Run up the hill to the corner, stopping at the odd light poles for five squats and at the even light poles for ten carolina dry docks. Then mosey back down to the bottom of the hill and repeato.

**Mary**

Fellowship run back to the flag and circle up for Homer-to-Marge (Disco), side plank star crunches (Hi-Liter), Arsenals (Arsenal), scuba doobies (Ollie) and Have A Nice Day (Disco).

**COT**

**Count-a-rama**:  19 **Name-a-rama**:  6 RESPECTs, 11 meh, 2 HATEs **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for Burt's FIL coming home from the hospital today, praises for Pierogi's friend's recovery from a brain tumor and heading back to work soon, prayers for Mississippi and his time in Kentucky, prayers for Arsenal as he travels next week before heading home. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**

Welcome FNG Squirt! Pierogi brought him out and even warned him not to try to name himself, and he still introduced himself as Tall Boy. I feel like we were too easy on him, other guys who tried to name themselves got it much worse.

It's amazing how an "s" at the end of a nickname can change its meaning.

Apologies to Hi-Liter and Ollie if I got the name of your Mary exercises wrong. Pretty sure I got them at least half right. Whatever they're called, they were very unpleasant, so good job.

Arsenal's Mary exercise was like a big boy sit-up, but at the top you extend your arms up over your head. He didn't have a name for it, so we're calling it the Arsenal just because he's such a good dude. Can't wait for you next visit.

Ma Bell returned from vacation and was feeling a little jumpy. He tried to call the standard merkin twice during warm-up. I gave him one just to make him happy, and agitated at the same time.

Thank you for wearing red, Burt.

No extra credit is needed at Danger Zone. Those stairs ain't no joke.

There are 75 stairs, and we climbed them seven times. That's like a million steps all together.

I ran up and down those stairs at a workout last year, and they crushed me. One year later I'm back, and while I can't say I crushed the stairs, they dang sure didn't crush me either. Thanks to all my brothers who have pushed me and encouraged me and made me stronger.
