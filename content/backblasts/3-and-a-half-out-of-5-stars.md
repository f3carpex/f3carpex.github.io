A glorious morn to disturb the peace, wake the dead, and get stronger in clear, 50-degree weather. 13 HIMs, including 1 FNG, so after a quick disclaimer and pledge, moseyed to the back of the church parking lot for warmup.

## Warm up

- Don Quixotes, IC, x10
- Sir Fazio forwards, IC, x10
- High knees, IC, x10, with arms outheld from SFs
- Seal clap, IC, x10
- Sir Fazio backwards, IC, x10
- Butt kicks, IC, x10, with arms outheld from SFs
- Cadence run-in-place, IC, x20
- Plank jacks, IC, x10
- Calf stretch, 10s each

## Thang 1 - Disturb the Park in groups of 3

After a quick tour of Jones park, divide into groups of 3. The first group completes a set and pushes the next group. Completed 2 full rounds.

Group 1 at the shelter

- 30 wide grip irkins
- 20 bulgarian squats (10 each leg)
- 10 scorpion derkins

Group 2 at the pickle

- One lap forwards
- One lap backwards
- Repeato til group 1 arrives

Group 3 at the parking lot

- Bear crawl across
- Lunge walk across
- Repeato til group 2 arrives

## Thang 2 - Wake the Dead 3.5's

At the hill by the cemetery, we did a round of 7's that turned into 3.5's as we ran up against the clock.

- Burpees at the bottom
- Dash up the hill
- Inchworm + Makhtar N'Diayes at the top

## Winding down

Moseyed to the side alley, where we ran in a quick cadence back to the church parking lot.

Quick bit o' Mary

- Some sort of sitting toe reach to wait for the six
- 10 Jackknives
- 10 LBCs
- Repeato

Mosey to AYG alley, where we had to dash to make it back in time.

Runner's stretch.

## COT

**Count**: 13, 2 respects, 10 meh's, 1 hate + FNG.

After careful deliberation, the FNG was dubbed Kool-aid. For the record, the reference has nothing to do with drinking the F3 kool-aid or cults...it was simply about respecting the drip. Claps to Kool-aid for keeping up with the Pax and putting in some hard work this morning, and welcome!

**Announcements**: Freed to bleed.

**Prayers & praises**: The safe birth of Imp's niece.

**NMS**:

- Despite my rep for themed workouts, the only thing Oscars-related in this workout is the title of this backblast...although YHC did consider some Glenn Close-inspired Da Butt work.
- An absent Tang had suggested cadence running. YHC has no clue if we did it correctly, but from what I read on our overlord Google, it should help us improve the number of footfalls we take while running, which reduces total impact to reduce injury or something like that. Maybe some of the runners could give a running form-focussed Q school.
- Don't tell Track Star you don't like bear crawls. For that matter, don't tell YHC.
- Claps to QWERTY for charging up behind me on AYG alley...made me actually push to give it all you got.
- The HIMs were just so eager to return home and finish the 3.5 left of the 7's that we had no coffeeteria.

It was great to return to Carpex and Q after a week elsewhere. Thanks to the HIMs for letting me lead and for pushing me. MIAGD!
