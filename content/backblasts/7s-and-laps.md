YHC's second Q this week started with a solo EC Run on some poorly lit, no sidewalk-having roads.  It reminded me a bit of the BRR.....dark...quiet....not another soul in sight.  Wait, did I miss a turn?  I must admit, despite the warnings from others that there's no good EC option at FMJ, I only saw two cars on this run, and they were easily avoided.  A brisk 4 miles and back in time to check out the new playground equipment, though we weren't going to use it today....just food for thought and future Q'portunities.

Also, as I pulled into the lot this morning, 43'ish degrees, full moon, stars everywhere, there was quite a decent buck and doe meandering around.  He was an 8, or possibly even a very nice 6-point.  Also, a Coyote stopped by to trot around checking out the scenery, too!  Kinda tranquil.

5:30, time to go!  After the Pledge, we headed down the sidewalk to the distant parking lot and circled up.

**Warm-a-Rama:**

**Thang #1:  Double 7's**

Mosey to the hill on the north side, famous for fire ants.  Not a big problem this morning

**Thang #2:**

- Keep the mosey going over to the track and partner up
    - YHC "missed" the usual Monday intervals on the track due to Odyssey DOMS, so..... let's do some intervals
- Partner up!
- Partner 1 runs a 400yd interval
- Partner two "cools down" for 50yds, then drops and begins doing LBC's
    - AMRAP until your partner returns, then switcheroo
    - All pax complete three sets

- YHC took us out after a brief reflective moment

I spent some 1:1 time with my 2.0 yesterday evening exercising and discussing exercise, why we do it, etc.  There was frustration, and perhaps a lapse in patience on my part.  Our kids are watching.  Always.  It's more important to **BE** the example than to preach.  Spend some time with your kids and impart to them that we don't do this because it's easy.  Staying in bed is easy.  It's warm.  It's comfortable.  But it doesn't build us.  It doesn't make us stronger.  Sometimes we choose the path less traveled to become stronger, smarter, better than we were yesterday.  We need to show them that we have fun along the way.  Get out there and do something physically tiring with your kids and show them they can overcome those challenges, and most challenges placed before them.
