I haven't been posting very consistently over the past 6 months but I have been doing the 2020 Core Challenge on an almost daily basis since the beginning of February. Therefore I thought it was appropriate to do a fair bit of core work for this (3rd) Anniversary Q. Also, considering the fact that due to the nature of my work, I'm holding a squat position for a good part of the day I wanted to incorporate some squat work as well. This was the morning the Hurricane Isaias was supposedly going to hit Carpex and I was expecting horrible weather and a low attendance. I was only half right.  

Warm up: Pledge of Allegiance followed by Good mornings, Side Straddle Hop, Imperial Walkers, Sir Fazios (forward and reverse) and Hillbillies. All 10 count, in cadence.

Mosey to far end of parking lot for Thing 1. 
Since there were only 3 of us, we had a team of three and modified the numbers. Dora: 150 Freddy Mercs , 300 Knee Benders, 450 1/2 sit-ups.  
  
Mosey to Rock Pile for Thing 2. Pearls on a string around the pickle. Frisco's mumblechatter was top notch as he explained the predicament his nephews had recently gotten themselves into.  
Round 1: 10 reps, Round 2: 15 reps, Round 3: 20 reps, Round 4: 25 reps

Exercises: Curls for girls (while holding a squat position); Goblet Squats; Tricep extensions (while holding a squat position); Rock your Body.

Mosey to Tennis court for 11's. Squats at one end, merkins at the other.

Mosey back to circle for a round of Mary- PAX pics favorite Mary exercise for 10 count: American Hammers, Eskimo merkins, Homer to Marge.  
  
COT: 3 PAX (Frisco, Kwik Stop and YHC). No announcements, no praises. Prayers for Kwik Stops son and Frisco's nephews. YHC took us out.

Thanks for another great year! I'm looking forward to Qing more often.
