The first cousin co-q (correct me if I'm wrong) was led on 8/15/19, where Speed Racer took the PAX from the window and Peeping Tom brought us round to the wall.

**Warm Up**  
  
Speed Racer called time and we moseyed to the bank where MARY was:  
IC:20x  
\- SSH  
\- High Knees  
\- Windmills  
\- Imperial Walkers

Then, because most of us could use a little more stretching:  
IC:10x  
\- Warm Up Squats  
OYO:30s  
\- Good Mornings  
\- Calf Stretch  
\- Hamstring Stretch

  
**Thang #1**  
  
After warming up, we headed across the street to Academy where down and back, the 13 single light poles were used as stops to perform 26(ish) rounds of:  
Single Light:10x  
\- Squats  
\- LBCs  
\- Pushups

  
**Thang #2**  
  
Peeping Tom took over in front of the bank. We moseyed past the train station over to the Pure Gold parking lot. Chipper mentioned this was a good pawn shop if you're looking to buy used goods. When we arrived we circled up for the following:  
\- Pickle Pounders ICX20  
\- Homer to Marge 1 leg up ICX20 then switch  
\- Homer to Marge regular ICX20  
\- Monkey Humpers were suggested but Peeping Tom had other plans.

We moseyed across the street by the RR tracks and through a hold in the brush to a big open parking lot. We then continued up to the outside of the Cary Chamber of Commerce building.  
\- The PAX partnered up based on speed. Partner 1 held BTTW while partner 2 ran back into the lot and then turned around to come back. Flap Jack, repeato with People's Chair.

As we began to run out of time Peeping Tom had to cut his last Thang out and we moseyed quickly back to the flag. There was no time for Mary.
