18 came to workout, a day after a much needed slap on the old wrist from the Nant'an, so with that a heightened sense to get the Pax working out, but also spread 'em out a touch, YHC designed a high tempo beatdown with that in mind.

High tempo warm-ups and lightening quick Good Mornings. Y'all need to chill about these Good Mornings.

Hell, we can't even count and do seal claps properly anymore. What in the high heck is going on around here. Tension were HIGH after warm-ups, the Q could sense it, but some words of encouragement from the Flippest of all Flops on the run back for the Thang lifted ma spirits. Plus, we were able to finish up Burt's set of J-Webbs on the way back from the warm-up.

The Thang:

- Assigned the pax four laps around the pond and the instruction to do 10 merkins + 10 squats + 10 LBCs at every bench and picnic table. The men went out and after it, and thus the pax spread out. We had to modify to 3 laps, which proved to be enough, for now.
- Took the guys over to the railing for a series of BTTR and People's Chair followed by some Bob-and-Weave squats. Burt hated the BNW squats. Not sure why. Crotchety.

Mary made an appearance. Callie cat-called Dolly. Hi-Liter got his way on some side planky star chrunchy.

Dr. Aric Von Slotta took us out.

NMS:

- RIP, Honeycomb's shoes.
- Sub, wishing you the best brother as you head for Charleston full time. Thank you for all you did for Carpex while you were here!
- Prayers for our brother Chinese Downhill and his family today!! 23 merkins for Gibson to start our workout.
- I freaking love you guys, but you knew that already.

We gotta go!
