37 degrees but it feels like 22. Or something like that. Five PAX in various get-ups designed to buffet the wind and cold gathered around where the flag is supposed to be at The Green Mile. The smell of burnt rubber was in the air. Everyone there had on their running shoes, so once Old Maid picked out which gloves he was gonna wear we were ready to begin.

## Warm Up

Yog the 0.49 miles from the the launch point to the front lot by the buses. Circle up for SSHs, Sir Fazio arm circles, Steve Earles, Plank Jacks, and CF Merkins.

## The Thang

Continue our yog down to the greenway to the ATT. Pause at the rock pile under the overpass for curls, squat thrusters, tricep extensions and man makers. Then continue yogging for Pearls on a String - stopping every 1/4 to 1/2 mile for exercises such as WW merkins, sumo squats, monkey humpers, Freddie Mercs, LBCs, Erkins and Derkins, Peter Parker merkins, hand release merkins, and some other stuff the PAX called. Return stop by same rock pile, all the same exercises except man makers.

Back the way we came, return time 07:25 for 8.2 miles total.

## Mary

Low slow flutter, Dying cockroaches, Runner's stretch, Calf stretch, Pigeon, and the debut of the Massage Parlor merkin.

## COT

One respect, 4 mehs. Prayers for Zip Drive returning to work after Old Maid broke his son's finger. Prayers for all of us with COVID-19 stuff going on. YHC took us out.

## NMS

- After doing hand release merkins on the return trip to the site where the flag is supposed to be, we came up with the Massage Parlor merkin. Alternate name is the Robert Kraft merkin. It was glorious.
- Biner gets credit for calling monkey humpers with the business end toward the McMansions
- I never knew Old Maid had so many different glove options. He chose the merkin gloves and we think this was the right choice.
- Speaking of Old Maid, he'll be "painting the hallway" later today.
- Don't sleep on Parker, he'll hit you when you're not looking.
- Snots has a peg leg.
- We also learned that YHC, Snots and Parker all are running the Tar Heel 10 miler. Snots, the bat-flipper that he is, is doubling down with the 4 mile run as well. Join us on April 18th.
- It was cold when we started, not so much by the finish.
- Always keep doggie treats in your pocket.
- Coffee shops were debated - WakeZone now has Piranha Joe's to contend with. In the end, we stuck with the traditional choice and further discussed marathon times and the invention of new exercises.
- MIAGD boys, be a little better than yesterday. Gotta go!
