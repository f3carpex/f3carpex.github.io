Perfect morning to start at #Whoville. Cool and calm. @Clementine brought the flag and long sleeves. The location brought inspiration for a Candyland theme workout.  
Started of a little rough. YHC is still new to all of this. No FNGs -- I asked and no one claimed to be an FNG – deserved mumble. Pledge. Run to the light – all 50 yards. Warm up and stretching with some reminder on how to play Candyland. Cadence was missed and a little off. Mumble chatter was a-plenty and well deserved.

## Exercise

Light posts were used in place of the Candyland spaces. Card one was BLUE: Off to the first BLUE light post: one Big Boy sit up. Accelerate back to start. Next Card: PURPLE: Off to the next PURPLE light post. Three burpees. On we progressed, card after card, light post after light post. Mosey there, accelerate back. Merkins, burpess, squats and big boy sit ups were mixed in. Distances continually increased as did the count at each light post. @Lucky Charms enjoyed the distance. @Bolton and @Five Hole rucked. By the 18th light post, mumble chatter was reduced for the 18 burpees. A few more light posts were hit. Unofficial distance 3.65mi. Time running out. Back to flag. Circle up: 120 merkins in single count sequence all around. 6:15am. Have a nice day.

Gathering at Sweetwater for coffee. Reminded the owner that they open at 6:30am, not 6:45am. He was very gracious and offered some complimentary breakfast sandwiches.
