YHC is working on his fitness _and_ his #CarpexChallenge so after making sure his passport is valid he hit up the ole Q sheet and got on for DZ.

Swung by and grabbed Open Out so we could take turns driving and let the other one sleep.  I love road trips!  Upon arrival we had to check our calendar.  This _was_ Friday, right!?!  Empty lot.  Soon enough the PAX rolled in.  Some via ruck (Pergo), some via vehicle (via vehicle, say it again, it's fun to say), and a couple running in (Flip and Permit).

All in all 9 PAX posted.  18 at DP I see.  Hmmm...

Anyways...

Single digits brought us back to the olden days of being able to get that solid 2nd F time in without needing to split into groups.  It was nice.  Not saying better, just saying it was welcoming.  I digress...

**[Fitness Challenge 9/2/2016](http://f3nation.com/2016/09/12/inaugural-danger-zone-fitness-test/)** Back in September Callahan put us through the gauntlet with his crazy stupid fun tough crawl heavy fitness challenge.  And as we now sit here 6 months later (in so much better shape) I felt it was time to get a refresher.  That way when Callahan returns (ah-hem, hint hint) we can challenge it up again!

So a quick warm up around the pickle and we head down to the starting line.  Or so I thought.  Let's just say Large and I have different definitions of "greenway".  I was looking for the paved path and he thought I was looking for the trail.  This was when it was wonderful to only have 9 guys.  You do this with 18 guys and the you've lost the group to chatter the rest of the morning.

So after our little "detour" in the dark (luckily 2 pax with head lamps!) we emerged back on the path and headed for BCB, skipping 1.1 station for now...

Again this is a refresher so as a pax of 9 we went through all of the fitness stations.  I upped the counts at each stop to 20~25 depending on the station and had two groups, other group doing Freddies while exercises were done at each station.

After the first lap we stopped at the start/finish and told the pax we would now run one full lap at race pace...**so that's what we did!**

It sucked.  Gah I forgot how bad a lap sucks.  Gah Callahan sucks.  It's simple math.

Callahan = fitness challenge fitness challenge = 1 lap of 9 stations 1 lap = suck _therefore,_ Callahan = suck.

OK after that lap we did a couple hill sprints with 10 x WWIIs and again with 10 jump lunges.

Then after that I guess I created a new Sucksercise.  I'm calling it the Derkin Shuffle unless it has been done before:

\- Every man get their own picnic table (9 pax makes this work perfect) - Get in derkin starting position - Start at the left side of the bench and do 1 derkin - Shuffle hands and feet to opposite end of bench for derkin #2 - Continue for a 10 count trying not to break. Works well for the end of a workout to really finish off the PAX

It finished me off and we did some Mary. LBCs x 15 to get my lungs back Side Plank J Lo's x 15 per side (possible new #SignatureMove here) Co-Q Coney called 15 box cutters

NMS

- Flip flop ran in from his house double fisting what appeared to be a water and a coffee.  Is this normal DZ?!
- Seriously Callahan.  TWO bear crawls per lap.  bruh.
- Open Out took at least hmmm 30 seconds to find what part of the wall he wanted to box jump.  Dude was scared he was going to fall off a cliff.
- It's not a cliff bro.  You'll be fine.  Pick a spot...
- Pergo has the. brightest. headlamp. ever. invented. ever.
- We needed it there on the "greenway".  Yeah that's right it's in quotes, Large, because that aint no greenway.
- Really questioning the Site Qs out there at DZ right now.  I'm gonna talk to the 1st F leaders.
- Guys, don't go straight to the nantan anymore about 1st F stuff.  Franklin feels left out.
- Know the chain of command guys, come on.
- Burt is seriously worried about nantan's approval of his 2nd F efforts.
- Nantan must have pulled a "Burt can I talk to you after" recently.
- What do you think the firing process is for that?
- If i were to guess I would say Nantan pulls out a scraper and scrapes off your F3 sticker right in front of your face.  Hands you the shredded remains and pats you on your back.  No words spoken.
- But for reals, Burt and Rip are kililn it with the 2nd F!  Keep it up fellas.
- Us 3rd Fs are kinda like, "uuuh uuuh, but Refinery!"  That's all we go back to right now.  But plans are getting set in motion.  Be on the lookout.
- Happy Friday, all!
