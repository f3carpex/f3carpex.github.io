Surprised to see 11 this morning. With the rain and flash flood warnings last night, I thought for sure everyone had already turned off the alarm. Not so fast my friend, let's get moving.

Warm up - Run to the other side of the Elementary school for 20 SSH, 10 GMs, 20 PJs, 10 IWs, 20 Mtn Climbers, 20 merkins.

Thang 1 - At the carpool loop for Speed Racer Inflating BLIMPS. 5 burpees, one lap, 5 burpees, 10 Lunges, 2 laps, 5 burpees, 10 lunges, 15 IWs, 3 laps....and so on and so forth.

Thang 2 - Down to the Middle School entrance. BTTW, Death Squats and merkins. 2 set.

Thang 3 - Run back to the flag stopping at each light pole right side or left side for 5 star jumps.

Mary - 10 LBCs.

McCants took us out.

NMS

\- More mileage than I anticipated but hard to figure doing a loop 21 times.

\- No sky writing today but it kind of looks like a fish......or a Largemouth bass...hmmmm.

\- day 2 in a row without hand release merkins.......it is a 12 step program so I am taking it day to day, thanks for asking.

\- it was also really difficult for me to not use the track. But Callie nailed it when he noted that a smaller loop made for less loneliness for those in the front.

\- 7 for coffee following at Wake Zone.

\- No rain. No Shut-in. No Flip-Flop.

\- this concludes the Largemouth triple down. Congrats to Michelob and Chanticleer on your completion. No shirts or burritos, just coffee and satisfaction. So you got that going for you.
