28 HIM show-up in the gloom expecting an epic Yogi beatdown.  Well, some plans are meant to change and YHC has stepped up to take the Q.  Weclome FNGs Quidditch and Double Dutch. After a mumbling, bumbling disclaimer and pledge at the flag, we head left and to the large circle for:

## Warm Up

  
Good mornings

Cotton Pickers

Steve Earls

Arm twirly thingies including behind the back.

## The Thang

The first of the many tangs actually starts at the end of warm-up with 5 monkey humpers and 5 burpees OYO.  That will be a common theme throughout the workout.  Up the hill to the street corner for more humpers and burpees.  Down the hill, stopping halfway for, you guessed it, humpers and burpees.  Much chatter at this point about repetition and the Q’s lack of any kind of workout.

Down to the basketball courts and circle up for some SSH and, yes, more humpers and burpees.  Divide the circle in half for some suicides and BTTW and peoples chair.  Funny side note, Q called for Al Gore and heard down the line, why is it called Al Gore….ahhh youth these days.

Done there we head into the gloom and to the far soccer field where we circle up for more humpers and burpees.  Now it is time for some compass work, heading in the compass directions for different types of workouts. North= star jumps, northeast for burpos, east for crabcakes, southeast for bobby hurleys, south for aussie snow angels, southwest for scorpion CDDs, west for dive bombers, and north west for diamond merkins.  Stories were told, much mumble chatter directed at the Q, and of course many more rounds of humpers and burpees.

Finished around the compass we head back to the flag, circle up on our six for:

## Mary

LBCs

Hammers

Merkins

Flutter Kicks

Bell tolls 6:30 and time to finish.

## COT

**Count-a-rama:** 28 PAX

**Announcements:**

Honored to lead you men this morning.
