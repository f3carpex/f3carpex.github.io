21 PAX gather in the early morning gloom to celebrate Ninjago’s 2nd ever Q, this time at Tortoises.  After a quick disclaimer and the pledge, the Q drags us around the upper parking lot to circle up for:    

## Warm Up

  
Good Mornings

Side Straddle Hops

Cotton Pickers

Windmills

## The Thang

Done with warm-ups, Q drags down to the lower parking lot, sneaking off to grab his phone and speaker for a listen musical pain.  First selection, Staying Alive, where Q instructs the PAX to hold plank and then, when the song breaks into Staying Alive, down we go into a merkin.  When the BeeGee holds the aliiiiveee, PAX holds at 6 inch hold.  Yes,. Some of the PAX where in the grove and did some J-Los to the beat.  Q finally comes to his senses and stops the song, since it is like 10 minutes long.

Next up, next song on the playlist, Thunderstruck by AC/DC.  I have not seen WWW grin so wide since the last time we did this song because….yes….we are to run in place and, THUNDER, down into a burpee.  Last count, there are 27 burpees under the thunder call-out.

Whew, done with the songs, Ninjago takes the PAX around the lower parking and over to the first hill for INTERVALS!  Partner up and, first partner moseyed down the hill, sprinting back up the hill while partner two is performing 15 squats and 20 LBCs (single count).  Flapjack when partner two is done.  Two rounds later we are done with this hill.

Q gathers us up and mosey over to hill number 2.  This time we are to perform 7s, one star jump at the top, 6 merkins at the bottom.  Up and down the PAX go and much mumble chatter shared.

Done finally with the hills, Ninjago takes to a rail nearby for Australian pullups.  Much grumbling about the rail and whether it would hold 21 PAX (hey we workout so why would that be a problem).  One round of 20 then we run around the back of the building, then one round of 10 Australian pullups. 

With time to spare, Ninjago takes over to the wall for some BTTW and people’s chair.  Counts down the line for multiple rounds until our shoulders are tapped.  Once more down the parking lot then bear crawl back up.  Circle up for:

## Mary

Q calls random PAX for dealer’s choice which included:

Hammers

LBCs

Mountain Climbers

Control freak Merkins

Dying cockroach

Bell tolls 6:15 and time to finish.
