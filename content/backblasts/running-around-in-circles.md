This week's version of Red Ryder tours Carpex takes us to Full Metal Jacket. One of my favorite site names, and an iconic movie from the 80s. A few months ago the decision was made to change the workout here from standard boot camp to high tempo, so the PAX are going to expect to keep moving. Luckily it's been raining off and on so we'll dodge rain drops and puddles.

First exercise, Pledge of Allegiance

## Warm Up

Mosey to the parking lot adjacent to the playground. SSHs, Sir Fazio forward and back, and Steve Earles.

## Thang 1

A set of 7s around the athletic field - Pull-ups on the playground and World's Worst Merkins on the other side of the field.

## Thang 2

Mosey to the rear school building, for a second set of 7s around it. At the traffic circle we do Mike Tysons. At the back of the building near the basketball court, we do Jump squats.

As we mosey back to the flag, complete 5 Burpos at each streetlight on the left.

## Mary

No Cally, no Dolly. CF Merkins x 15, standing Have a Nice Day

## COT

9 Hymns, with 1 Respect and 8 Mehs. Orphan had some announcements including another F3 Burgaw trip. Red Ryder announced the F3 Whetstone push across Carpex. YHC took us out.

## NMS

- 3.9 miles covered, by my count
- It was moist
- There is a chain on the outside of the gate leading to the inner playground, and you don't want to run into it.
- Denali expects exercise names to make sense. Tighten up!
- Ask GTL about the time he met his M's grandfather for the first time.
- It was a good workout for MC the entire time, and I enjoyed talking with all the PAX
- That said, I appreciate the understanding for my slight pause to stretch out my calf between Thangs. Seems I strained it somewhere along the way.
- MIAGD, and be a little better than you were yesterday!
