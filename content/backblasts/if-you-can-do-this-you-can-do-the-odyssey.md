Excited that Braveheart felt he was ready for his VQ

Being a typical dad, I wanted to get him to really map out his plan, but in typical teenage fashion “I got this, don’t worry about it”. And he pretty much did.

Best moment was in the announcements when he brought up our CSAUP Odyssey and told the Pax that if they can do this, they can do the Odyssey. #NailedIt

Thanks to everyone for the encouragement they gave him and look forward to him on a solo Q in the future.
