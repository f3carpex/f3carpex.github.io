**AO: Flirtin w/Disaster**

**June 26, 2018**

Weather forecasts can be an inconvenient distraction.  After days of threats (90% chance of rain, thunder!) Build-a-Bear calls a pop-up EC three miler, departing 0430.  Not a rain drop in sight. Such was the beginning of a muggy morning at YHC’s first pre-arranged Q at Flirtin’ w/Disaster. Some of the PAX may have suffered a flash back to YHC's disorderly pop-up Q at this very AO about a month earlier, where we spent quality time on and across the US1/64 pedestrian bridge. And so today, we returned to the Bridge of Pain, this time with a plan.

**Warm-Up**

Mosey to the big balls circle, circle up

F3 Disclaimer, then Good Morning, SSH’s, Abe Vigodas, Hillbilly’s, Mountain Climber. Partner up. Q calls out the first Thang (allowing the PAX time to absorb the fate that awaited them), then medium Mosey to the bridge.

**The Thang**

At the Bridge of Pain: partner assisted Pullups AMRAP, switcheroo; Bear Crawl to the center, 10 partner clap Merkins; Lunge Walk to end of bridge;  repeato partner assisted pullups AMRAP; Bear Crawl bridge center;10 partner clap Merkins; Lunge Walk to the end;  Squat Hold Al Gore for the six, recover.

Indian Run in two columns to the power lines. Partner Carry up the trail to the gate, switch off as needed; 10 Bropees; Wheel Barrow back (most made it about half way, modified, Q called a recover ...that's a long hill to wheel barrow as it turned out) and Mosey to the Rock Pile.

At the big balls circle, round and round wait for the six, mosey to the rock pile for 20 Rock Rows, 20 Tricep Extensions, 20 Curls for Girls, 20 Overhead Presses, rotating left each time. Drop rocks and around the circle, back for 10 reps, repeato switching to next exercise until all four complete; rocks back on the pile and Mosey to the flag.
