NMS: It was an honor to lead you men this morning.  It's great to get out to the other side of town and catch up with everyone. It looks like we had a very nice distribution of PAX across 3 AO's in Carpex! I hate I missed the casserole at SWW. Appropriate weather this  morning for launching Carpex's newest AO - Slippery When Wet.
