YHC doesn't post at 0515 workouts every week - the times I have, the numbers have been, shall we say, non-problematic. However, on this particular Halloween morning there are 17 PAX, including 2 FNGs, up and at 'em at Koka Booth.

Time to move.

### Warm Up

Mosey to the big parking lot, circle up and warm up. SSHs and some other stuff, finish off with 5 CF merkins.

### The Thang

Partner up for Tammy Wynette intervals: Partner 1 completes 20 Merkins while Partner 2 completes 20 squats, then flip flop. Once each partner has done both exercises, 80% run to the other side of the parking lot. Complete 10 sets (each partner has completed 10 runs, 200 merkins and 200 squats).

With time to spare, recover on the mosey to the bottom of the hill. Keep your partner - Partner 1 works on a total of 200 LBCs and 200 Supermans with your partner, while Partner 2 Backwards runs up the hill and moseys back down. Flip flop until complete. Mosey back to the flag.

### Mary

1 round of Captain Thor up to 10:40, 10 Steve Earles for Richard Simmons (Squatter). Have a nice day.

### COT

17 PAX, welcome FNGs Backdraft and Trapper John. YHC took us out.

### NMS

- 2 PAX in costume, YHC which lasted 5 minutes, and Squatter who stayed in character the entire time.
- One of the FNGs was originally named Romeo, but we later found that has already been used. Given he is a physician, YHC made the call to give him Trapper John.
- Liverpool should know who Trapper John, MD is.
- I'm also claiming merlot from the same FNG, who was "stretching" behind the bushes after COT
- As always, it is a pleasure to lead you men. Be a little better today than you were yesterday.
