AO: Danger Zone

Date: 5/17/19

PAX: Archetype, Cataracts, One Direction, Pierogi, Press On, Sosa, WWW

What a beautiful day for some beach sandy fun without the beach. My body was still trying to recover from the workouts this week but that was not going to deter me from challenging these HIMs. I know they are up to the challenge.

The PAX was ready to go so we did the F3 admin stuff and Pledged our Allegiance to Ole Glory.

Off we moseyed to the shelter.

Warm-up: GM, Abe Vigodas, Sir Fazios, Moroccan Nightclubs, Seal Claps, Overhead Claps, Calf stretches with CFMs in between.

Thang 1: Thunderstruck burpees

Thang 2: off to the tables for my Unlock the Merk routine. As the song plays, on every "unlock" in the chorus, the Pax would do an irkin. During the music, the PAX can do L/R step ups, squats, or anything as long as they keep moving.

Thang 3: Partner up for some modified Dora. Exercises: Walmart burpees x50, Prime Time Merks x100, and WWIIs x150

For the sake of staying on time, QIC called it short by not much to head back to the flag for some Mary.

Circle up for PAX favorite Mary x10 reps. Lots of good call-out but Archetype crushed us with closing out the beat down with burpees x10. Disco Duck would have been proud. They say burpees is not a Mary exercise, but if it is called during my Q, **_IT IS_** a Mary exercise.

COT

QIC took us out.

Count-a-Rama: 7

Name-a-Rama: 3 respects, 3 mesh, 1 hate

Announcements: Crazy and Night Train (see deets in Slack), TCP Sawgrass on 5/26, memorial Fay Convergence (see deets in Slack), Carpex 6-yeariversary 100 PAX challenge (EH a friend or contact a Brother you have not seen to make it back out).

Prayers/Praises: Pierogis friend who has daughter's, Sosa and M for their new baby, healing touch on all the Brothers with ailments and recovering.

NMS:

No matter how tired you are, getting out in the gloom is always a blessing and, no kidding, euphoric.

God / Universe / Buddha etc. is GREAT!

Get out an serve others ... it will enrich your life!
