Cool & crisp at FOD this fine morning!

Ten HIMs gathered -- No FNGs, only familiar faces.  F3 intro given & we started with the pledge & moved out to a close-by parking lot.  Shut-In let me know that I’m the 39th Q he has graced his presence with this year to date – I’m so honored that I finally make the top-40!  With that, we rolled into:

The Warm Up

Circle up for good mornings, windmills, SSH, calf-stretch merkins, mountain climbers, etc.

Thang 1

I need to get better at pull-ups, so we did pull-ups.  Counted down by 2’s from 20 reps with alternating short run for CDDs & bear crawls…. So, it was 20 pull-ups, CDDs, 18 pull-ups, bear crawl, 16 pull-ups, CDDs, etc.  Good work!

Mosey to soccer field for side plank star crunch -- good times!

Thang 2

Classic 7’s on the soccer field – burpees in one corner, merkins on the other – simple.  Shut-in got angry & lapped the field – solid work! 

Head to the flag for some Mary – LBCs, Homer-to-Marge, Supermans, HAND.
