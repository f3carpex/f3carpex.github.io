GrowRuck 17 is coming to Southern Pines NC the weekend of November 15-17, 2019. GrowRuck is an intensive weekend of F3 Leadership Development, including plenty of 1st, 2nd, and 3rdF. As F3 is an organization OF leaders, all PAX are welcome to participate.

The cost to participate in the GrowRuck Tough Challenge is $150. This includes GrowSchool, GORUCK registration, a T-Shirt, and sweet patches. Please HC (hard-commit) by [registering now](https://f3nation.com/product/growruck-17-quicksand-pinehurst-nc-nov-2019-deposit/).

Registrations made through September 22 will require a $75 deposit which helps us secure the Cadre. The final $75 balance (or $150 full payment) will be paid at the same site and is due October 11. Registrations at full price will be taken up to the day of the event, but a T-shirt is not guaranteed due to required lead times. **Why are you still reading this?

## **The F3 Nation GrowRuck**

What, you ask, is GrowRuck?

It’s simple: GrowSchool + GORUCK Tough challenge. In one weekend, you’ll get, 1stF + CSAUP + 2ndF + F3 Leadership Development & Training.

We've seen how important CSAUP events are to building 2ndF amongst the PAX. No CSAUP event that we’ve ever seen has the same catalytic effect on 2ndF and F3 growth as F3 guys getting together to do a GORUCK Tough challenge.

So, we thought, why not combine the two?

GrowRuck will be led by GORUCK Cadre Shredder and Cadre DS, and will be in all ways an official GORUCK Tough challenge. Our F3 veteran Cadre will tailor activities and the teaching to reinforce the GrowSchool curriculum and lessons. Dredd and Slaughter will participate in the challenge alongside the rest of the pax.

In 2018, we had almost 300 men complete GrowRuck events in Jacksonville, Eastern North Carolina, New Orleans, Seattle, Chattanooga, Toledo, and Memphis.

PAX from regions throughout the Carolinas (and beyond) are encouraged to toe the line and show Sandhills our support and brotherhood.

### **What else is included?**

Patches, naturally. Always earned, never given.  
A GrowRuck T-Shirt will be included with your registration. Tri-blend is life.

## **Gear**

The most frequent question asked when an F3 group begins to look into doing the Challenge is _“do I need to buy a $300 backpack”_. The short answer is no. A GORUCK ruck is not required, but [GORUCK Rucks](https://www.goruck.com/rucksacks/) last -- FYI: the Rucker model ($265) goes on sale from time-to-time, and F3’s Ruck Clubs often receive discounts that may work for the Rucker, depending on the month. Veterans, teachers, and first responders all get discounts as well. Contact your local RuckQ or one of the event Qs for details. The [511 Rush 12](https://www.511tactical.com/catalog/product/view/id/41611/s/rush-12-backpack/category/40296/) is a $99 version that some guys use. [The 511 Rush 24](http://www.511tactical.com/rush-24-backpack.html) is slightly larger and slightly more expensive. Also, many guys pick up second-hand rucks at Army surplus stores, eBay, or Craigslist. [More gear info here.](https://f3carpex.com/2017/03/21/rucking-101/)

Another option is to Tweet with the hashtag #LendARuck and tag the @F3GrowRuck account in your tweet asking for a ruck, and someone from the F3Nation will answer the call (kinda like the Bat Signal) and ship you his ruck to use. In return, you’ll wash it and send it back to him with a sweet F3 Lend-A-Ruck patch.

Besides a ruck, you’ll need some bricks or a plate for weight, a headlamp, reflective PT belt, and a hydration bladder.
