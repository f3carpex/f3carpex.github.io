- **When:** February 26th, 2018
- **QIC:** Earhart
- **The PAX:** WWW, Wilbur, Capone, Sour Mash, Monkey Nut, YHC Earhart

For what feels like the 5th Monday in a row, it is raining for HBs.  YHC plan for the workout was curtailed as we cannot use the Bells in the wet.  So, thanks to a well-lit and roomy shelter right next door, the Q will be in there.  We drag the bell’s into the shelter and distribute them around the different benches (or is it pain stations).  Wilbur nods at me it is time to go so we head out and left to our usual circle for:

## Warm Up

Good mornings

Overhead Claps

Cotton Pickers

Sir Fazio Arm Thingies

## The Thang

Done with the warm-up, we head back to the shelter where we had previously dropped the kettlebells to begin the impact workout.  Q takes the two 45lb weights and puts them on the sidewalk, then announces a different workout per station for each us.  One of the HIM is going to farmer carry the two weights down the path while the rest of the HIM perform the first round (all done OYO):

Kettlebell swings

Curls

Around the World

Goblet Squats

Tri-cep Extensions

Overhead Presses

We rotate positions and exercises once the farmer carry returns until everyone has had a turn with the farmer carry.   We then mosey around the tennis courts for a break.  I am told that is about a quarter of a mile, perfect distance for a mosey.  With everyone back at the shelter we start round two:

Kettlebell swings, one arm

Lawn Mowers

Curls

Halos

Nut cracker squats

Squats with the medicine ball

Once the farmer carry is done, we mosey once more around the tennis courts and back to the shelter for the final round of upper body workouts:

Snatches

Curls

Goblet Squats

Overhead Presses

Upright Rows

With five minutes to spare, we each grab a kettlebell and circle up for:

## Mary

Mary with a kettlebell is a little different as you are generally holding the bell during the workout.  Mary included:

WW2 sit-ups on the up

Freddie Mercuries in cadence

Big Boy Situps

Dying cockroach

LBCs in cadence

American Hammers

Bell tolls 6:15 and time to finish.
