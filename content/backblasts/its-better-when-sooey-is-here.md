Another dark, rainy, gloomy Carpex morning, perfect conditions for a Duck.

**Warm-Up** Mosey down to the end of the parking lot and circle up for hillbillies, burpees, cotton pickers, Sir Fazios, copperhead merkins and copperhead squats.

**The Thang** Mosey over to the railings between the soccer fields for Australian pull-ups and irkins, starting at 10, descending down to 1, but making the last round 10 reps again, just for fun.

Mosey across Too Slippery For Bearcrawls Bridge to the pond and partner up, one partner does AMRAP Rock Your Body while the other runs the pond pickle, flapjack until everybody gets three laps.

Mosey back over to Too Slippery For Bearcrawls Bridge for 22s, 21 wide grip merkins at the third lightpole down the path, 1 prisoner squat at the bridge, decrease the merkins by four, increase the squats by four, until we get to 1 and 21.

**Mary** Mosey back to the flag and circle up for dying cock-a-roaches, LBCs, Homer-to-Marge, American hammers, Freddie Mercs, low slow flutters and Shawshank (Have A Nice Day while standing in the rain, arms stretched out like Andy Dufresne at the end of Shawshank Redemption).

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  13 **Name-a-rama**:  0 RESPECT, 11 meh, 2 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for continued recovery for Ausfhart and Sooey, prayers for Parker's friend Eric and his wife dealing with neurological issues, prayers for Monkey Nut travelling to Central America next week with some F3 Raleigh brothers, prayers for Liverpool and his family on the anniversary of his son passing. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS** For the past two years it seems like every time I run around the pond at Apex Nature Park I end up running next to Sooey. But he was not there today because he's recovering from back surgery. I visited with him yesterday and we took a slow, short walk through his neighborhood. His surgey was a success, his recovery is going well, and he'll be back in the gloom, pain free, very soon. I can't wait to run around that pond with him again.
