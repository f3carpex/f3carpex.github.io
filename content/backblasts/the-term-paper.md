**Today, at Flying Circus, 13 PAX celebrated two dates that will forever live in infamy. The first, June 6, 1944, the day when Allied forces stormed the beaches of Normandy to begin the liberation of Europe from Nazi Germany. The second, June 5, 2018, the day of my first F3 posting at Field of Dreams, led by Term Paper.**

**To commemorate these two events, we replicated my first F3 Carpex experience designed by the famed Term Paper, and added some D-Day twists as well. We call this “The Term Paper”**
