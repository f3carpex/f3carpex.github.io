Y'all heard about this new podcast? Ha! Of course you have, YHC has been shamelessly plugging the heck out of it. With that, a purrfectly timed Q'd was in place at SNS.

After going in the studio of HIM of the year nominee, Disco Duck [(here's the ep)](https://soundcloud.com/f3pickupthesix/pick-up-the-six-disco-duck-ep-6), it was time to roll and YHC knew for a fact that the fellas would be fired up.

**Warmup:**

- Over to the other lot for warmups including:
    - PUT6 (cotton pickers on a 1-2-3--1--4-5-6--2 count), we did that 6 times
    - 12 SSH
    - 18 Merkins
    - 24 Sir Fazio (front and back)

**Pearls on a strang thang:**

- Mosey to the gate for 6 burpees
- Mosey to the closest pavilion for LRSU, Irkins, Dips, Derkins
- Mosey to the other pavilion (down the street and across the lot) for LRSU, Irkins, Dips, Derkins
- Repeato that again with a back-and-forth
    - On the last mosey we moved the 6 to the front of the run... PUT6! #abb
- Mosey to the kiosk for a quick round of Mary and then a set of 6's on the hill (star jumps + lbc)
- Mosey to the bottom of the hill for 3 rounds of squats, merkins and LBCs
- Bearcrawl the Hill
- Billy run to the flag
- Mary and we out

Announcements and prayers/praises were heard.

**NMS:**

- Lot of pod talk, in all seriousness I'm grateful for you guys, your support, and your stories on the show. It's been a trip and we're just getting started! [All eps are available here](https://soundcloud.com/f3pickupthesix).
