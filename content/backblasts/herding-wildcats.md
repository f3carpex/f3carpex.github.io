**AO:** Field of Dreams  
**Workout Date:** 07/13/21  
I had some workout ideas in my head when I pulled into Field of Dreams, but those plans were mostly dashed when I discovered the baseball fields and the walkways between them were locked off. I did a quick mosey to get some new ideas, entertaining some mumble chatter from Banjo as he warmed up on the playground. I really wanted to avoid Rack Em Stack Em since I've called it quite a bit recently, but it worked out so well on the turf soccer field at Dante's Peak, and the soccer field at FoD was open. At least my traveling road show means I don't see the same PAX too often. I don't think I've had any repeat customers the past couple of weeks.

**Warm Up:**  
Wait, is Banjo really starting a conversation with somebody at 0530? This isn't even mumble chatter, this is a full-on, full-attention conversation starting right behind me... It took me a few seconds to realize he wasn't stopping. Time to press on...  
Very loudly state the mission to everyone else, check for FNGs (0), and give the disclaimer. I am told Franklin would approve of my delivery.  
Pledge of Allegiance  
Side Straddle Hop x20 In Cadence (IC)  
Good Morning x5 IC  
Imperial Walker x20 IC  
Sir Fazio Arm Circles forward x10 IC, reverse x10 IC

**Main Event**  
**1) Rack Em Stack Em** around the soccer field. Burpees x5, Merkins x10, Squats x15, American Hammers x20 IC.  
**2) Partner AMRAP/suicides** across soccer field. One Partner does AMRAP exercise while other partner runs across field and back. Flapjack. Hold for the six to switch to a new exercise. Six different exercises total. I do not remember what they were. Merkins, wide grip merkins and diamond merkins were included since I heard some mumble chatter about a heavy focus on the legs.  
**3)** **Balls To The Wall/People’s Chair/Australian Mountain Climbers** on the fence at the soccer field. I only threw these in because someone mentioned them randomly. A couple of PAX didn't get them memo that suicides were over. We called them back, but I did take note that BTTW, etc. would work really well with the suicides.  
**4)** Mosey back to start for **a variation on Sevens**. I'm currently calling them stationary sevens until a better name comes up. PAX performs a whole set of sevens in the same spot (no run from one exercise to the other). Once the Entire set of sevens is complete, the PAX all take a lap around the parking lot. Just one round here due to time.

**Mary:**  
A couple of minutes of Mary. Dolly, Homer to Marge, Rosalita, Freddy Mercurys, possibly others. Carpex PAX always seem to mention Callahan when Dolly comes up. \*insert shrug emoji\*  
Stretching (downward dog, isolated calves, world's greatest stretch with pigeon pose included).

**COT:**  
11 PAX  
  
Announcements:  
**1)** Carpex Dads on 7/17 at 9am, led by YHC at full Metal Jacket AO  
**2)** South Wake/Carpex Q Swap Week(s): Last week of July in South Wake, First week of August in Carpex  
**3)** Likely others I've forgotten.  
  
Prayers spoken and unspoken.  
I don’t remember who took us out.

**Naked Moleskin:**  
I haven't seen Nature Boy since years ago at The Forge in Raleigh. Good to see he has mellowed out.  
Banjo and I have differing opinions on Camp Galdiator's workout music.  
Happy Birthday to Kidney Stone, who gave his previous age at first in COT. Not sure when the big day was, but it must've been recent.  
I missed the beginning of the college discussion, but when Duke came up, Banjo started talking about Christian Laettner. It seemed random at first, then I remembered Banjo is a Kentucky guy. Was he there when Rupp FNGd?  
It was nice to meet Pigeon in person after having our names swapped once or twice in conversations on Slack.  
This was my seventy-seventh #F3Q21 #2021Challenge Q (seventy-ninth overall). Next Q is Thursday at The Judge in Raleigh.
