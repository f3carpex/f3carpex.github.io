Flying Circus 04/18

Another beautiful morning at the finest AO in NW Cary on a Thursday morning.  Driving in without my regular clown-car-compatriots, I wondered who would show for todays installment at FC.....of course 10 of Cary's finest HIM turned in for a beatdown from YHC.  Here's what we did:

**Run to main entrance & circle up**

- 20 SSH; 10 windmills; 10 GM’s; 20 IW’s; 20 plankjacks; 20 mountain climbers
- Abbey road lunge walks - back and forth
- 13’s - Kerb / bear crawl / Derkin

**Run to SOCCER PITCHES:**

- Number off 1, 2, 1, 2
- In pairs, enjoy the following pairings of exercises, lovingly selected for todays beatdown:
- Half pitch Suicides / Aussie mtn climber
- Full pitch suicides / big boy sit ups
- Half pitch suicides / merkins

**Run to Track**

- Track - 400m AYG / seeded - first lap marker - remember placing - second lap reverse order....third lap and fourth lap ditto - then have done a mile round track.
- In between laps: squat jumps; lunge jumps; plank jacks; mountain climber until everyone done

**Stairs** - having named the staircases track 1, 2, 3, 4.....regular descent down tracks 1 & 3 with ascending up tracks 2 & 4 in turn with bunny hop, L LEG hop, R LEG hop, Regular

**Mary**....box cutter, "o-face", wwii, Finish on have a nice day

 

**Prayers**

\- 13's are a lot.  No, really....you try it next time....they really are.

\- Australian Mtn Climbers were special tribute to Disco Duck based on his Slack-trolling that YHC was actually Australian.....

- Heard at F3:
    - If Pigeon were posting in South Wake, would he become Pidge-for-life?
    - Yoga mat wondering where the nearest AEDquipment was .
    - Disco really loves burpees
    - 3 way is not always the right way to describe a multi-person conversation.....
