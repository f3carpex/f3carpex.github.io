As Pickles always says "Preparation H is key". So to impress my junior site Q I made sure my weinke was laid out by my keys last night. Driving in to Claymore I felt great, I was back out in the Gloom, I had successfully Q-ed HB yesterday with a modified version of one of my COVID lockdown workouts, and I was heading to the premier limited run AO in Carpex on a Tuesday.

Thus my chagrin as I looked down and realized my weinke was the one from HB yesterday. And I could see that Pickles was sober so he would sense any hesitation on my part and jump on it. (Why had I made that guy an assistant junior site Q?) I could also see Re Entry and Kwik Stop there and they had been at HB so they might recognize the workout. Then again Kwik Stop spent most of the HB workout napping (you have to read yesterday's backblast to get that joke) and Re Entry has often said he considers my Qs to be FUBARs at a level he never thought possible (which I think is military-speak for 'great work'). So with a little modification it would probably be okay.

"This better be good, Frisco" said Earhart. "I came all the way from Apex." Then mumbled something about Q-shopping. It was time to start.
