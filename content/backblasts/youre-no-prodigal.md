Sunday afternoon, YHC was finally done with most of the chores for the day (after a great morning TRM tuneup run with Wonderbread), and checked in on Slack to see what was up. First priority was to check on the Q status for Gran Torino Friday...**OH NO we need a Q**! But then, a more urgent call for help was noticed. **Prodigal needed someone to take his Kryptonite Q.**

It's been a while since I Q'd (and especially Kryptonite), so I tossed my hat in the ring. You get what you pay for, fellas. Preblast was "TRM taper week. Bring a headlamp."

0515: arrive on the other side of Symphony Lake to place a landmark for later. Turned out not to be terribly needed, but Be Prepared.

0520: arrive at the AO. In comes some EC runners hauling donkey (Oofta, Chanticleer at the point, GTL and Squatter running smartly).

0525: most of the pax ready to roll, but...who's that coming in hot at 0529? With the Flag? And trunk coffee? Quick note that playing the role of Prodigal was Old Maid. Grumbling of disapproval.

0530: start with 5 burpees as co-site Q Wonderbread was still in full taper speed, run a 3/4 lap of the pickle to stop at the flag for the pledge. Mosey over a little further to get Wonderbread in on the action. GMs, SSHs, IWs, then let's mosey around the pickle again.

_Thang 1_: Team up in 3s or 4s, and 5 HRMs Catch Me If You Can Indian Run around the lake til you see the light, marking the access to the trail that takes you to the parking lot we _can_ use.

Arriving there, the last, ALL IMPORTANT, warmup, windmills. Yes, very important that we did them right there.

_Thang 2:_ Anywho, the NEXT exercise is bear crawls up those steps and sidewalks. All of them. Plank hold at the top, waiting for the 6 (YHC). All in, we moseyed up the sidewalk, (and of course YHC dropped his weinke) over the "CONSTRUCTION ONLY" OSB sign, clearly not meant towards us. Continue our little yog on up to the parking deck, where we stepped out onto the deck at a perfect spot. Paint the lines to the far wall (half to the left, half to the right). At the wall, the next instruction is...the Massage Parlor Merkin Webbicide. I thank Red Ryder and the crew at **_The Green Mile_** this Saturday for the introduction of that magical exercise. Run to the first light pole, do one Massage Parlor Merkin (the pax liked its alter ego better...the Robert Kraft Merkin. Google it.) Run back to the start. Run to 2nd light pole, 2 MPMs, run back. All the way to the end, where you'll stay there. Believe it was 5 light poles.

After the last one, plank hold for the six, various right arm high, left arm high, then a low plank hold that Grease liked.

_Thang 3_ was gonna take a while to get to, so we fellowshipped back down to the lake trail, and set up for the next exercise...5 Monkeyhumper CMIYK-IR all the way around to the lot just past the loading dock, our next rally spot. Hindsight, would've been faster going the other direction. Oh well.

All arriving to rally spot, we Al Gore'd (well, most of us did), then moseyed up the hill to a round or 2 of 4 corners.

Corner 1: 5 Makhtar N'diayes, run to corner 2, 10 Bobby Hurleys, run to corner 3, 15 Werewolves, run to corner 4, 20 Carolina Dry Docks.

Plank hold for everyone, then back to the start, but flip the count; 20 Makhtar N'diayes, 15 BH's, 10 WWs, 5 CDDs, then various broga planks at the end. YHC a little gassed so balance and appropriate extremity names were failing.

Wrapping it up, YHC heard a 6:12 call and we were enroute to the finish. Circling up, it was 10 box cutters, 10 cox butters, 10 LBCs, and a nice round of Have a Nice Day.

**COT**

No real announcements to speak of, so here are the current standars: The Mule is Saturday 3/14. The Tobacco Road Half/Full Marathon is Sunday 3/15. The Burgaw rebuild day is 3/21. Check Slack and the F3 Carpex Calendar for more info.

No Praises. YHC offered prayers for 2.1 DeNiro who got a nasty ankle sprain at Defy Gravity yesterday. Bounce gyms are an evil from the devil himself! Continued finger healing for 2.0 Zip Drive, who will have surgery in April. Healing prayers for Prodigal and others who are injured. Also prayers for health and calm nerves for everyone racing this weekend, that they don't get the taper crazies (which WILL happen)

**NMS**

Hope y'all had a little fun. No, it was not very well coordinated, but it gave me a chance to try some things I've wanted to try at Krypto. One was that long-a$$ bear crawl. The other was to use that parking deck more. Paint the lines alternating sides helps loosen up YHC's hips, so I used it as an active stretch. The MPMerkins are a challenge for me, and I will continue to try them out. And as Chanticleer and I discussed as we started Thang 3, Monkey Humpers _can_ be a good stretch. As I was jotting some things down last night to try this morning, it came into my head too late to try to do a basketball theme. So, you were left with that awkward 4-corners thing with some basketball exercises worked in. Tried to work in 4 different body groups to get a little stretch, and a little strength.

I think this morning was a nice chill Krypto. Not crazy. Not a distance record. Not too difficult. Hopefully allowed some modification as required. Left no one behind. (Almost) started on time. Finished on time. Covered 3.33.

Trunk coffee a la Wonderbread was wonderful. Lots of good conversations going on, hated to have to head out. In related news, Wonderbread and Denali are looking for new Kryptonite Site Qs. Apply within!
