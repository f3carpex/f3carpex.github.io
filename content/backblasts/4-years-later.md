Mumble chatter was strong with the focus being that of some football game coming up this Monday.  

YHC shared about 4 years ago looked like vs today. Though I was active on my own, I was in dire need of the PAX as I really didn’t know anyone in the area as a recent West Coast transplant. 

Four years later and I can say that I have done things I never thought I could do.  Though I still have my struggles as we all do, 

F3 has indeed made me better and stronger, and for that I thank each of you.
