A lovely, lovely day at Gran Torino. Perfect weather, and an awesome pax! What do I have planned for today? Nothing special. A very simple, yet effective high tempo workout. Just another day at the finiest Hihgh-Tempo bootcamp AO in Northwest Cary.

We started with a quick and abbreviated F3 Briefing. No FNG's today so let's go!

    - I'm sure I'm forgetting something

Today's pax at Gran Torino included three folks who participated in the F3 GoRuck Custom last weekend. Bartman on the Heavy, YHC on the Tough, and Skipper on the Light. (Not present today, Banjo on the Touch and HotCakes on the Light). Guys, this was my first GoRuck, and I have to tell you, the leadership and teamwork lessons instilled (not taught) there are like no other. So simple in the method, so simple in the lesson. Yes, it's pretty brutal, and I recommend you grossly over-train for these, and DO IT. It's not "just walking around with a backpack on." GO DO ONE!  

Have a great weekend!
