**NMS:**

If you have not done a ruck, you're missing out. Carrying around 20+ lbs for the workout works your body in other ways. So, Q'ing a Ruck workout is a blast. All you need is to hit the WWW and google "ruck workouts". It's amazing what is out there. It was fun doing the research and then executing the thang.

It was an honor and blessing to be out in the gloom with awesome HIMs to have the same drive as you to ruck it out.
