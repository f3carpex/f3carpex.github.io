When the scheduled Q doesn't show up for the workout it's up to the site Q's to provide the beatdown the PAX have come for. With our brother Sub AWOL, and after losing four of seven games of rock, paper, scissors to co-site Q Smokey, it was up to YHC to deliver.

**Warm-Up** Mosey into the park, notice the batting cages, advise the PAX to remember them, perform ten burpees to aid their memories. Mosey to the parking lot next to Power Line Hill, notice the batting cages, advise the PAX to remember them, perform ten burpees to aid their memories. Continue with SSH, good mornings, cotton pickers, Sir Fazios, Morocaccan night clubs.

**The Thang** Mosey to the big basketball court and partner up. One partner bear crawls half the court and lunge walks the other half, while the other partner alternates ten World's Worst Merkins and ten World's Worst Crunches, flapjack and repeato for three rounds.

One partner runs a lap around the pickle, while the other partner stays on the court and alternates BTTW and ten World's Worst Squats, flapjack and repeato for three rounds.

**Mary** Mosey back to the front lot, stopping at the batting cages (remember them?) for ten burpees. Continue to the front lot and circle up for box cutters, cox butters, Homer to Marge, Freddie Mercury, LBCs and Have A Nice Day.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  17 **Name-a-rama**:  RESPECT, meh, 0 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for Silverback and Hermes having surgery this week, and all the guys still recovering from injuries, praise for having Crimson back in the gloom. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**

I noticed a few weeks ago that Sub had signed up to Q on April Fool's Day. I reached out to him to see if he'd like to play a prank on the PAX, and if I could help out. He agreed, but before we could come up with a devious plan, he found out he wouldn't be able to make it today after all. So we decided to leave his name on the Q sheet, so that I could act angry when he didn't show up, then lead the PAX through a modified version of his VQ at Bounty Hunters a few weeks ago.

I don't know if the rest of the PAX liked it, but YHC and Sub have been laughing about this for a while.

I especially enjoyed the batting cage burpees.

I don't know if Sub invented the World's Worst Crunches (WWII, LBC, dying cock-a-roach) and World's Worst Squats (jump squat, sumo squat, regular squat) but at the very least he gets credit for sharing them.

Thanks for letting me lead and for being good sports about the sub.
