A lovely morning for a workout!  We have been truly blessed the last three days with some fabulous weather!!!  Roughly 60 degrees this morning, with pretty high humidity.  The preblast indicated this would not be a Blue Ridge Relay training workout and while there WOULD be running, it would not be a run-centric workout.  Turns out, we still managed a little over three miles......

Bayonne, Biner, PBX, and I met for some EC hill repeats at 5:45 and ran a little over 30 minutes on the High House hill, joined about 3/4 into the run by Snots and Chipper.

Time for the main event:

Two FNGs joined us this morning, and were in for quite the treat!  After a warm, welcoming briefing we're off!

**The Warmup:**

Slow jog down the road, down to the kiosk and out into the field to circle up for Warm-a-rama with tunes provided by YHC:

- 20 SSH
- 20 Imperial Walkers
- Here comes Callahan running through the mist towards like our chief warrior, Achilles into battle; he's late so......
- 10 Burpees OYO
- 10 Calf Stretch Merkins OMD, switcheroo
- 10 Good mornings

**Thang 1:**

- Mosey to the dam hill and pick a large rock
    - _At this point, several pax recalled my last Bond Park Q with 11's on the hill......this time is "Same Same, but Different..."_
- 20 Rock Rows
- Run up the hill
- 3 Worst Merkins Ever
- Run back down, direct or "The Long Way" (individual choice)
- Repeato at your pace until YHC calls time (7:00)

**Thang 2:**

- Mosey to the Playground, Thoroughbreds at their pace and Mary until the 6 arrives
    - LBCs
    - Freddy Mercuries
    - Rosa
    - Low Slow Flutters
- Six is up, now for some Dora
- Pick a partner
    - 100 Pull-Ups
    - 200 Merkins
    - 300 Lunge walk paces
        - The lunge walk replaced the "run" section of a typical Dora
            - Same same, but different......get it?

Three Line Indian Run back to the Flag....and we're back right on time!  (Note to self..."Afternoon Delight" does NOT belong in an F3 playlist.  At least not unless we're doing "Have a nice day."  Skip that trash in favor of Moxy's "Sail on, Sail Away." MUCH better for the run back!

**COT:**

25 HIMs

**Announcements:**

- 10k/5k/1 Mile Carying Place Labor Day run reminder, check slack for the free code
    - Krypto is featuring a 1-hr beatdown prior....possibly a Murph, TBD
    - Bond Brothers is serving beer as part of the event
- 8/31 Convergence at DZ for Carpex Anni
    - TRULY SWW's Anni, which is being celebrated two weeks later

**Praises:**

None

You guys inspire and motivate me.  I've got to tell you, FNGs can show up at many workouts, and they are typically a bit overwhelmed by the intensity.  Phoenix adds an extra 30% to the normal workout and I must say, today's FNG's KILLED IT!!!!!!!!!!  Eveready admitted in COT he had no idea what he was in for (and I suspect he's going to have a few words with Texas Ranger on the way home!) And he also said with eager enthusiasm he's definitely coming back.  Mulder was visiting Repeato Repeato from out of town and also pushed hard during this workout.

I'm proud to be a part of this thing, and proud to sweat with you guys in the mornings!!!  MIAGD!
