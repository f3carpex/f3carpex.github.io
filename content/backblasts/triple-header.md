First off, YHC is grateful for being introduced to F3 by my man Flacco and to being so warmly received by each & every Carpex HIM I've encountered.  I sure am enjoying my F1's & actually look forward to collecting in the gloom & getting the sweat flowing with this fine group.  I've been able to participate in a couple F2 & F3 events as well & will be active here -- Someone said F3 is kind of like a cult, but I disagree -- this is a high-quality fraternity with only the good attributes:  make each other better (HIMs) via challenge & encouragement, serve to improve the communities we live in, & have some damn fun along the way.  Again, I’m very blessed to have this in my life now.

After traveling for almost 30 years and raising 4 boys with my wonderful M, this F3 thing is hitting me at a good time of transition in my life.  I’m so impressed by some of you posting with lots of crumb-crunchers in the house – amazing.

I love to contribute to things I’m involved in, but was apprehensive about my first Q -- would I remember the proper way to run the show, how do I do my best without delivering a disappointing workout, can I count & breathe, etc.  I did have my troubles, but, hopefully I was close to the standard & my intent is to continue to improve personally.

Ok, so here’s what went down at Danger Zone – tried to tie to the Triple Header – my VQ, 3-month anniversary, and B-Day #51.  Y’all picked up that 17 X 3 = 51...
