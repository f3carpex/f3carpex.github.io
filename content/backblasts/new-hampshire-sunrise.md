23 Pax for Shaken Not Stirred,4 Pax for Vesper, 5 Pax for Insomnia

Q - Hermes, YHC

Insomnia ran about 4.5 miles or so, I really don't know exactly.

I have no idea how far Vesper ran, but they did swing by New Hampshire and they were late for COT, I assume they covered at least 6.5 miles in the 46 minutes.

NMS-

Sitting here at work, just got back from a meeting, I have a pile of work on my desk to do, so I will procrastinate and write this up first!  Priorities.

How about Joe Smith, he has really stepped up his game.

I am very grateful for all these guys that set up all this communication stuff.

The sunrise was nice, but not nearly as impressive as the Kryptonite sunrise on Monday.  Neither of which compare to an inverted sunrise at FWD!

It was an honor to lead you fellas this morning.
