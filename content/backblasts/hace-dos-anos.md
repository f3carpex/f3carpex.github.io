On some date in early to mid August, 2017, YHC showed up at Sovereign Grace Church on a Wednesday. An FNG. CHIPs from South Wake had been EH'ing me for a while, and I always had an excuse. Some excuses were more real than others. Anyway, the workout was hard and I kept coming back. Two days later I posted at Dante's Peak, and was officially hooked. In celebration of this momentous occasion, 9 PAX showed up at Tortoises in the driving rain, under threat of thunderstorms, to help cap off year 2.

4 HIDAs for some EC pullups and running in the rain

### Warm Up

SSHs, Good Mornings, Sir Fazio arm circles, Plank Jacks, and 50 Merkins

### Thang 1

Bear Crawl Indian run the length of the parking lot (thanks Hermes!).

Once complete, 25 Copperhead Merkins on my down.

### Transition

Jack Webbs up to 10:40

### Thang 2

Mosey across the street to The Hill. 11s, with Dying Cockroaches at the top and Monkey Humpers at the bottom.

Back across the street to the church, line up for one round of BTTW Indian run. Once complete mosey back to the flag.

### Mary

Captain Thor up to 8:32...Have a nice day.

### COT

- Some respects, one hate, more mehs
- Prayer's for Mary, Getty's friend's M who has recurrent cancer
- Prayers for F3 nation as we seek to take the next steps to solidify a growing organization
- YHC took us out

### NMS

- How perfect that it was pouring rain today.
- Workouts are harder with a 20 pound vest. Thanks Theismann for the push.
- We did no 10 counts this morning, and these guys did great.
- Seems like I'm seeing new faces every post. That's a good thing, we are doing this for the guy who has not yet discovered F3.

I could go on and on about what F3 has meant to me these last 2 years, but will make this short and sweet. It is transformational, if you embrace it. Living a very intentional life makes one more productive, more happy, more fulfilled, more pleasant to be around, and generally just more disruptive (in a good way). I've discovered I am capable of much more than I thought. Spread the good news, EH that new guy, and be a little better than you were yesterday.
