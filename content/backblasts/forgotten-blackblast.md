\*\* AUGUST 28 \*\*

YHC Q last Friday at DAC. That was almost a week ago, but here goes!

Group of 8 PAX gathered at Apex Community Park eagerly anticipating a Sooey Q (hey it was last week!).

YHC forgot the Pledge, there was no flag. And we were off at 5:30 sharp.

Mosey to the normal warm up spot for some warm up.

Mosey to the large shelter for a routine of Step ups, Urkins, and Dips. 20, run pickle, 15, run pickle, 10, run pickle.

Mosey to power line hill for 5's (running out of time). Star jumps and Squats.

Had some extra time actually so 2 burpees per light pole back to the front parking lot for some mary.

We did some Mary. No idea what, but I'm sure it sucked.

YHC took us out, many prayers in the group.

NMS:

- Sorry this is late
- I still think BB are important
- Better late than never? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
