It is good to be back at the Ordinary.  Prior to the workout the Site Qs are making things happen.  Jigglypuff is using Clorox wipes to clean pollen off his car and Burt is handing out tank tops from a briefcase.  Just another Thursday morning in DTC.    

No FNGs.  Pledge.  Mosey towards the police station to circle up on the finest grass in Cary.       

- 5 GM IC
- 10 Sir Fazio IC
- 10 Seal Clap IC
- 10 Fazio Sir IC
- Calf Stretch with 15 Merkins per leg

Mosey a bit farther to the old school parking garage.  There was a time before Covid when YHC associated this garage with Pain Sticks, and I'm willing to bet they are still sitting back there.  Bingo.  I can still remember my first introduction to the Pain Sticks, when someone told me that Banjo had spent a good portion of his life filling PVC pipes with concrete to aid in the suffering of his fellow man.  Incredible stuff.

Press On comments that Burt hates pain sticks as much as PO hates running.  Luckily YHC is able to make both of them happy with a PS Indian Run to the top of the deck structure.  Except Burt announces that he is going to do the PS workout without the whole PS part and quickly hides his in the corner.  It also happens to be the lightest one, so thanks to Burt for getting that out of the way for us.

Up top we partner up for the PS Dora.  100 Curls / 200 Overhead Press / 300 Rows with a stair/ramp running loop.  This really hurts.  The Pain Sticks are obviously angry at being ignored for 12+ months and claim Staubach's vertebrae as a punitive sacrifice.

We follow this up with 18 PS LSFs IC and 18 PS Squats.  The goal is 20, but we need to cut it short once we are almost run over by Cary PD.

Down the stairs to replace the Pain Sticks so they can be used again next week.  Callahan mentions that his arms are smoked, so we do 20 merkins to help him loosen up.  Mosey back to the flag for LBCs and HDs.

YHC is presented with Degree and a Naturday.  Proud, proud moment.  TCP Sawgrass Sunday.  Prayers for Loom's daughter who is dealing with a potential collapsed lung (Update - Praises for a successful surgery).  YHC took us out.
