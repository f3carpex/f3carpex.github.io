AO: POINT BREAK

DATE: 4 NOVEMBER 2020

QIC: WRENCH

PAX: BAGELS, BOBBY DOLL, COXSWAIN, HGTV, MAYFLOWER, TERM PAPER, WRENCH, VHS

I have been having a hard time to wake up and work out here lately, so I needed the accountability that F3 offers. Texas Ranger snagged a Q, so I followed suit and grabbed up Point Break. Didn't have much planned, but knew I needed not only the exercise, but the fellowship and comradery that this group offers.

Last time I Q'ed PB, I left a light on in the truck and had a dead battery in my truck. I woke up early to try to get some EC miles in, and the cold weather had claimed my battery for good. Jumped it off with a little jump box, headed over with not enough time to get the miles in. That has been rectified as of today.

At go time, we had 8 guys around the flag. No FNGs, so no real disclaimer needed. Starting with the pledge, we took off for a mosey to the Whole Foods parking lot. Basic warm ups including Good Mornings, SSH, and Imperial Walkers.

The Thang: 100/200/300/400 Dora: Merkins, Squats, Shoulder Taps, and LBCs. The team that counted held everyone up, which makes me question the counts of everyone else, but the PUT6 mentality of the PB regulars is strong, and everyone did extra shoulder taps (because 300 just isnt enough). Was a good time, and the small pickle helped the HIM doing the work not get into a groove of the work.

As we moseyed back to the flag the long way, this workout gets weird. A woman driving by waves us down, frantically, asking if we had seen her son. 17 year old, weird story of him being in that parking lot, we grab some identifying information and we all scatter running Waverly looking for Andrew. As 7 of us got back to the flag, we realize VHS is still hard at the search, so Coxswain and HGTV start running to find him, while Bagels grabs his phone to call it in to Cary PD (who oddly did not get a call from mom).

Announcements: Duck Donuts Dash 6 February. VHS hosting a bible study

Prayers/Praises: Our Nation. Andrew and family above.
