YHC turned 50 on 6/7/2019, the date of this workout (yes the Backblast is late). Half a century on this fine earth and feeling all the better for it! After a truncated EC run with a few of the regulars, 26 of us circled up for the pledge and a Birthday Q.

**Warm-up** Quick jog around the lot, then circle up for Good Morning, some Side Straddle Hops, a sloppily Q'd set of Hillbilly's and some Michael Phelps style arm stretches. Let's go... mosey out of the park, turn left and head for the big lot.

**The Thang** Three stations, back by popular demand, with pain pills at station one, a full array of various Merkins as station two and some Star Jumps and ramp work on station 3. Four laps around and we're low on time. Back to the flag.

Mary for a few abs and a final tally 2.6 miles, 45 minutes, and 26 extremely sweaty HIM's (it was super humid).

So YHC invited FNG Jim to the birthday party. He's 76, or about 5x older than the youngest of the PAX that day and something like twice the age of the average.... he's appropriately now called Whippersnapper. Excellent.

COT followed by Coffee with Oofta and birthday cake and fellowship.

It was my pleasure to lead today. Thanks for the Respects and looking forward to another fine year on Mother Earth.
