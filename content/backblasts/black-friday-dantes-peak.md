A frigid, crisp morning greeted 5 PAX, who decided to skip Black Friday craziness for an early morning beatdown.  Parker came in hot, just in time, for us to take off for some quick feet to get the legs warmed up.  We mosey back to the parking lot for:

## Warm Up

Good mornings

Side Straddle Hops

Cotton Pickers

Hillbillies

## The Thang

Done with the warm-up, although warm is a subjective thing, YHC starts in on the Black Friday theme, with an Indian Run around the perimeter, because what is the first thing you do on Black Friday is get in line in the cold and wait.  Although, we were not very sympathetic to the other guys in line as we kept cutting from the back.  How fights get started.

We finish at the basketball courts and circle up for, what I term a Black Friday experience, as suicide.  In between two rounds of suicides on the court, we perform a 5-count people’s chair down the line.

Now the fun begins on our Black Friday, with a mad dash to the doorbusters, running a give-it-all-you-got from the top of the hill down to the parking lot, looking for that great deal on the TV.  Reaching the parking lot, we see all the TVs are sold out so we did 10 penalty burpees.  Next up is the fingerlings, the “it” toy this holiday season.  Give-it-all-you-got back up the hill to the top.  Guess what, they are sold out so 10 more penalty burpees.  One more item to find, a new Garmin Vivo watch for Hotspot, sprint back down the hill.  They have them in stock, so we celebrate with 10 starjumps.

Now we need to go shopping for the Mrs., so we head to the “rock” pile, bear crawling down the bridge because that is what we do at DP.  We choose an ego rock and circle-up for a round of curls-for-girls, overhead presses, lat extensions, and rock-rows.  Dropping the rock, we run a lap to consider if that rock is good enough for the Mrs.  Returning to our pile, we choose our buddie’s rock, seeing if they have better taste in “rocks”.  Same rounds of curls, presses, and rows with another lap around the pond, this time opposite direction.  One final round of rock work before we decide she has enough jewelry and put our rocks back.

Mosey back to the upper parking lot, with a lunge walk up the bridge (hands were too cold for bear crawls) we head to the shelter (food court).  In the food court we perform various rounds of irkins, dirkins, left-right step ups, and dips.  Three rounds in the food court to show shoppers how to stay in shape over the holidays.

Done with our Black Friday theme, we head to the flag where we circle up for:

## Mary

PAX led speed Mary included Hello Dolly, box cutters, dying cockroach, low-slow-flutters, J-Los, finishing with Merkins called by GTL.  Bell tolls 6:30 and time to finish.
