First, credit to Denali for the #twss quote (possibly paraphrased) that became the backblast title.  We wrapped up our workout on the featured hillock near the Salem Pond Park parking lot, but there was oh so much more this PAX of 12 did on the first sub-50 degree morning in several months.

**Announcments**

**Prayers/Praises**

- The Shore and his family and friends in Charlotte as they deal with their tragic loss.  Also CD's safe travels and strength as he attends the service and helps them through this difficult time.
- Grease Monkey's M and her upcoming doctor visit as she continues to battle health issues
- Old Maid's M as she recovers from her recent injury.
- FMJ co-site Q Shank's recovery from his injury.  We look forward to seeing him in the gloom again soon!

YHC took us out.  As always, it was an honor and a pleasure to lead.
