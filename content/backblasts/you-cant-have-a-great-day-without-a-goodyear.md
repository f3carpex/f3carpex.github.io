**Pre-Blast**

16 HIM pushed themselves and grew stronger at Phoenix. Tecumseh was there.

**The Warmup**

- Pledge of Allegiance at the flag
- Mixed Run to the East Lot
- Circle up for: Burpees, GM, WM, CP, Diamond 'Mericans, Plank Jacks, Mountain Climbers, WG 'Mericans, SSH, Hillbillies
- Run back to the Senior Center entrance, Ranger 'Mericans and Prime Time 'Mericans on the way.
- Partner up for partner decline 'Mericans.

**The Thang**

- Partner Double Hill BLIMPS: Partner 1 runs to the Kiosk for 5 Burpees while Partner 2 runs to Jersey Mike's for 5 Burpees. Run back to the entrance, AMRAP Mary while you wait. Switch hills, run out for 10 lunges and back. Keep switching hills and adding 5 reps to complete the BLIMPS.
- While you're running, learn something new about another PAX. Be prepared to share about your brother at the end to avoid 10 Burpees.
- Circle up at the flag, do 10 Burpees because Tecumseh asked for them. Share about your brothers...do 30 more Burpees before it's all said and done.
- One final quiz about Biner...he likes French cuisine :)
