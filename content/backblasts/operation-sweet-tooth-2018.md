### GIFT IDEAS FOR EACH AGE  -  [(PDF DOWNLOAD)](https://gethope.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/2018_ToyStore_1UP.pdf)

**When purchasing for teens**, gifts that can be wrapped are preferred to gift cards. Kids of all ages love opening gifts! Suggestions: purses, jewelry, make-up, curling irons, straighteners, footballs, soccer balls, tennis racket and balls, baseball equipment, headphones, penny boards (skateboard), backpacks, sports bags, clothes (jeans, shirts, sweaters and shoes). If you prefer a gift card, restaurants or clothing stores are a huge hit. Please refrain from giving Target or Wal-Mart gift cards as families might be tempted to use them for necessities rather than as a gift.

**Gifts for ages 9-12 years can include:** sports equipment, board games, G or PG movies (DVD), LEGO sets, penny boards (skateboard), roller blades, digital camera, purses, backpack, sports bags, craft items, bracelet makers, paint supplies, tie dye supplies, clothes (jeans, shirts, sweaters, and shoes), board games and puzzles.

**Gifts for ages 5-8 years can include:** Lego’s, dolls or Barbie’s, toys, books, sports equipment, back pack, lunch box, clothes, shoes, G or PG movies (Frozen, Big Hero 6, Inside Out, Despicable Me 1-2, Minions, etc.), coloring books and crayons, board games and puzzles.

**Gifts for ages 2-4 years can include:** toys, books, toddler learning movies, educational toys, blocks, large Lego’s, baby dolls, stuffed animals and clothing items.

**Infants thru 1 year can include:** soft toys, teething toys, bath toys, bathrobe, clothes, sweaters, jackets, etc.

\_ **What _is_ Operation Sweet Tooth?**
