**Pre-BB**

Last fall, I chaperoned my son's field trip to the NC Zoo. Master of the obvious, I noticed that all the animals had animal names. So there's that.

**BB**

YHC promised that Phoenix this morning would be a "zoo." So, we went exclusively with exercises named after animals.

When I mentioned my plan after our Pledge of Allegiance, I heard from the twenty-three strong PAX that we were "talking too much." About half way through today's beatdown, there was no talking to be heard. Panting, squawking, and barking, yes...but no talking. Mission accomplished - this was a zoo. Oh - and the light rain made it all the more...zooish.

Shout out to Flipper from Richmond, VA F3. Good to have you, bro.
