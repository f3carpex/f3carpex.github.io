Temps in the mid 40s. A perfect day for a strong group of 21 PAX to log a few miles and eat some hills for breakfast. Good to see Yoda make the trip from Raleigh again, and his guy Curry.

This was YHC's 2-week delayed birthday Q, after being sick with the flu on my actual birthday.  Thanks to Burt for the beer lesson and for bringing me the gift of various of Anheuser Busch products (you know, because Michelob). I'm enjoying one right now as I type.

A little audible right from the start due to delayed tank top distribution, but we handled it well.
