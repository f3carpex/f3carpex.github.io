AO: Tin2Iron

PAX Ausfarht, Intimidator, Shipyard, Sosa, FNG 3 Finger Salute (TFS), WWW

My schedule changed for 14 days which caused me to be at work no later than 0630. So, I have to leave at 0530 to get to Alamance from Cary. After no making it to the gloom those weeks other than a Saturday, I needed a reboot to get back into my normal rhythm.

I got back to my normal schedule on Wednesday so I went to Tortoises to get a beatdown by way of Crimson. In that workout I pushed myself but I picked up the Six to get a PAX motivated. I still had energy to burn.

I decided last week to sign up to Q my site. Read on to see what we did.

Since we had an FNG, we went through the Mission, Core Principles, and Creed. We did the Pledge of Allegiance and mosey walked to get the joints moving.

Warm-up: over here, GM, Sir Fazio, overhead claps, and runner’s stretch. It’s ironic we did a runner’s stretch in a non-running AO. Stretching does a body good. Mosey to get a cinder block. Moving onto thang 1.

Thang 1

Super 21 de-escalate

Point 1: Curls and coupon squat x21

Mosey to Point 2 to do Irkins and dips x21.

Mosey back to Point 1 to repeato x19. Mosey to Point 2 and repeato x19. Continue until you get to 1.

For the sake of time, QIC had the PAX wrap up their final set and mosey back to the flag for Mary.

Mary: ABC and have a nice day.

COR: 6 HIMs

NOR: 3 Respects, 3 mehs

Announcements: Sasquatch CSAUP
