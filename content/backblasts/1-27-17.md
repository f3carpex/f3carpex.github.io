15 PAX joined me this morning to celebrate my 1-year F3 Anniversary.

One year ago, my good friend Crimson convinced me to be ready to go at 5:15 am for a workout on a cold January morning. When I arrived at Dante's Peak, I was overwhelmed with new people with funny nicknames including our Q (which I eventually figured out was the leader) named Hotspot. I don't remember what all we did that morning other than bear crawl the bridge at DP but I thought there was no way I'd be back much less lead a workout.

Great weather and lot's of mumble chatter this morning. It is definitely what makes Carpex special. Thanks Hermes for your contributions!

At 6:30 sharp, we took off for the far right parking lot near the baseball fields for:

Warm Up

- SSH x 15
- Imperial Walkers x 15
- Arm circles x10 each direction
- Merkins x 20

Now some time for burpee fun.

- Corner 1 - Squat jump x 5, run to corner 2

- Corner 4 - full burpee x 5, lunge back to start
