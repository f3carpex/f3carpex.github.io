School was back in session on Thursday, and 13 lucky pax made it out to gloom for the beatdown! With about 15 minutes till the start a few pax came in from their EC run, and 1 pax came in hot with a few seconds to spare. So with that the disclaimer was given, the pledge was recited and we were off running a lap around the parking lot!

_**Warm Up:**_

Finished the lap and circled up for:

- **Good Morning**
- **SSH**
- **Moroccan Night Club**
- **IW**
- **Plank Jacks**
- **Calf Stretches**

_**Thang 1: WMD Crawl**_

In **Bear Crawl** position: 5 **Werkins (wide grip Merkins),** 10 **Bear Crawl** steps, 5 **Merkins,** 10 **Bear Crawl** steps, 5 **Diamond Merkins,** 10 **Bear Crawl** steps. Keep repeating the routine till the set destination was reached.

_**Thang 2:**_

**Indian run** with 2 groups till the entrance of Kelly Rd Park. In that parking lot we did some ab work, then used the parking area to do slightly modified **Lt. Dans.** (Ratio of 2 **Lunges** and 2 **Squats**). We continued till we got up to the ratio of 20:20.

Then **Plank Hold** in a circle. Designated number of Pax did a 10 count.

_**Thang 3:**_

Pair up for a **Catch Me If You Can** run back to the flag. Each time you’re caught alternate between 6 **Shoulder Taps, Am. Hammers, Monkey Humpers.**

_**Mary:**_

- **WWII**
- **Black Widow Knee Slides**
- **Freddy Mercs**

We did a few more Mary exercises that I can’t remember at this time.

We finished our time together with: 10 **Burpees** and some stretching

**COT**

**Announcements:**

Backyard Ultra, Oakwood 24, Duck Donut Dash are all coming up.

**Prayers/Praises:**

For God’s will to be done with everything involving the election and our nation.

For Banjo’s daughter.
