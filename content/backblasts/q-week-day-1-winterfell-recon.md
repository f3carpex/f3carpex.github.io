This week marks the one year anniversary of YHCs first posting with F3, and as such I am marking it with 5 Qs in 5 Days. Given all the craziness of the world, YHC feels that it is necessary to give the PAX something to rely on, a good beatdown. This week also marks the first week of the new Monday AO in WCary, Winterfell. This site will have a 0530 launch, with plenty of EC options available to the PAX.

Warmup:

To begin the recon, we naturally needed to become familiar with the lay of the land, and mosey’d to the back lot with the busses. Circle up for:

SSH

Good Mornings

Arm Circles-Forward

Seal Clap

Arm Circles-Backward

Overhead Clap

We then ran some parking lot lines around busses, with side shuffling on the lines, backwards running to finish.

ME:

To begin the ME, we used what will likely be a widely used portion of campus for the QIC going forward, a 50-meter hill at the back of the school. YHC wanted to PAX to get some running in, so we did a 7s routine with burpees at one end and Merkins at the other. About half way through this, our final PAX showed up due to an alleged Comz breakdown (or a burpee avoidance technique), Ma Bell came in just in time to catch 5 penalty burpees.

After this, we headed to another perk of this site, a full track. However, rather than run on this track, YHC thought it would be better to use it to introduce the PAX to a portion of the Devil’s Mile (courtesy of Churham PAX Uzi). Light on time, the PAX socially distanced paired up, partner 1 would bear crawl around the track, while partner 2 would do 10 merkins, then lunge walk to catch their partner, then the roles reverse. This routine was done around the track, YHC had planned on a second rotation, however the PAX will have to wait on that.

Mary:

YHC introduced the PAX to several new concepts during Mary, including the Frog Crunch, Ski Abs, and “On your 1” (as opposed to the 6). Ski Abs, Frog Crunches, and Ring of Fire was all done.

COT:

Prayers for safety and recovery for those effected by or treating Coronavirus, keep safe by being mindful of yourself and others sickness.
