1. FOD feels incredibly far from my house, but momma didn't raise no b\*tch.
2. As Hermes says, always watch your language, even though you can't see yourself talking unless you are in a mirror.
3. 24 degrees feels awfully cold unless you have gloves and the warmth of fellowship.
4. You can't get mad at someone not recognizing you when you are dressed like a ninja.
5. Always pay respect where respect is due. T-claps to Wolfpack basketball and their win over Virginia. Merkins for all.
6. Haters always gonna hate, but as best as possible you should always take the high road. Even when your football team beats the hater's football team by a wide margins.
7. Comeuppance is real and feels oh so good.
8. When you are at a site and your workout finishes before the workout, join in and finish up. Don't be a bystander.
9. When your team can't win, it's time to simplify and focus on the basics. No need for anything more than vanilla.
10. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING, SIR!

Welcome FNG, Show Tunes. Respect!
