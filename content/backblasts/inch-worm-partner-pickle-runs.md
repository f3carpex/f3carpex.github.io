6 for EC run. Normal Route.

**Warm Up -** Run to the big parking lot for a little warm up. 15 SSH, 15 IW, 10 Merkins, 10 Plank Jacks, 5 GM, and a few arm circles because Grease was there.

**Thang 1** - Run over to Half Hill. Broad Jumps, Lunges, Bear Crawl, Skips for Height, and All you got down the hill and jog back up.

Â **Thang 2** - Inch Worm Merkins Partner Pickle. One partner runs while the other does inch worm merkins. 3 Rounds.

Run to the big parking lot for Thang 1 again.

**Wimpy Legs** - Jump Squats, Jump Lunges, and Donkey Kicks until you burn out.

Run to the flag and complete Thang 2 with your partner.

By this time Grease was worried about the mileage so instead of my wimpy legs we did All You Got Circles. Started out with bear crawl, reverse run, and things and then all you got around the circle. 5 times or so.

COT - 12 including new comer 90210 to Kryptonite (as far as I know).  

Thanks for the chance to lead!

Grease said watch out in two weeks!
