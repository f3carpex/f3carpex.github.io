19 PAX gathered to launch the newest, Saturday AO in Apex, Piranha Park!  After 127 days of soft launching, YHC and Peeping Tom finally made it official and 17 others were there to celebrate.   Gather the PAX at the flag for a pledge then start with walking down the path, high knees and butt kickers; with advancing age trying to start out a workout with a little stretch for the warmup.  Mosey to a small rise the has adequate breeze and start the:

## Warm Up

  
First of 25 SSHs

Control freak good mornings

Run down the hill karaoke to the right for the next 25 SSH and some sir fazios and alternating seal/overhead claps

Up the hill, karaoke to the left for the next round of 25 SSH and some Steve Earls

Continue up the hill stopping at the top for another round of 25 SSHs and some squats

Down the hill and to the DP circle for the final set of SSH (27) and some calf stretching and plank jacks.  Finally done with the traveling warm-up PAX are ready for the:

## The Thang

We mosey over to the soccer pitch for some speed work and exercising.  First round is to run at 50% effort to the far end of the field, stopping for a round of burpees.  Mosey back across the field back to the original start line.  Now run at 75% effort to the ¾ line stopping again for a round of burpees.  Mosey back to original line again, turning and run full-out to midfield, stopping for yet another round of burpees.  Mosey back to the original point and perform last round of burpees. 

Next round of sprints was same as the burpee round but with sumo squats.  Unfortunately, we were getting forced off the field by some of the early morning soccer players so we only got several rounds of sumo squats and only two round of flutter kicks with sprints before we needed to bail.

Out the back exit and over to the basketball court for some suicides with BTTW and BTYall and people’s chair.  We needed to finish some sprinting work.  A round of bobby hurleys because we were on the basketball court.  Most PAX missed all 15 “shots”.

Mosey out of the court and backwards run down the hill to the bear crawl bridge where, yes, we bear crawled down the bridge.  Pop-up and mosey to the rock pile where we count off by 3s.

Group 1 gets some rocks, group 2 goes to the pull-up bars, group 3 goes to the far corner for mary exercises.  The pushing group was the pull-up group where the PAX did 5 pull-ups then moseyed to the mary group that then pushed the rock group to the pull-up bars.  We had just enough time to do two rounds.

Mosey back to the flag and perform 5 minutes of stretching and finished up with have a nice Saturday.
