Buenos Dias, Hermanos.

When it was announced that Liverpool and Water Wings would share their Chimbote, Peru (or is it Chipotle...) story with the Pax at a bread braking and the Q sheet was WIDE FREAKING OPEN for that day, YHC had to jump on it.

Knowing we'd have a squad on hand, I was extra excited (hard to believe I know) for this one. With a resounding Yooooooooooooo at 0544, we got ready to roll out.

Vespers headed in one direction and we were off in the other, taking the pax down to Carpex stadium for warm-ups.

Warm-up:

- Es el F tres y yo soy Hola Gatto (in honor of our brothers' trip to Peru)
- En Espanol, ejercicio premero es buenos dias (good morning) with the uno-dos-tres count.
- SSH, Arm Circle and Overhead Claps
- 23 merkins (love you CD, love you Gibson)

The Thang:

- Move to the rock pile on the back side of New Hampshire
- The next exercise is the Roof Dog
- Partner 1 doing rock work while partner 2 runs to the top of the roof (up the stairs) and back... 3 times through
- Move the pax back to Carpex stadium for a competitive game of Bull in the Burpee Ring. Nice work, men!
- Up the hill and move the pax to the pocket park for Dips, Derkins and Irkins, 3 times through with an ab "break" in between each set.
- Billy run on the street and back to the lot for a round of Mary hosted by our Nan'tan, Mother Bell.

COT: A combined 49 between the SNS and Vesper boys filled the circle. YHC took us out before our bread braking with Wings and Liverpool.

NMS:

- If you missed the bread braking and the powerful story from Wings and 'Pool, don't worry the PUT6 microphones were present.

- During the ROM (Ring of Man) I shared part of Isaiah 40:31. I kinda butchered it, but my point holds strong. You men lift me up every day. Thank you!
- Let's go!
