DangerZone was my first post, on Aug 23rd 2019, having done pretty much nothing active for 10 years. Today was my VQ. Thanks to everyone for your support over the past three months and to those who were able to post at DZ today! I'm fitter in body, mind and spirit thanks to you all.

**Warm up** - Take my breath away

A variant of motivators (introduced by Slappy at Claymore a few weeks back) consisting of cycles of Side-straddle hops (ssh), ssh-arms-extended, ssh-arms down, plank straddle hops, each x20, then x15. Got the calves nicely warmed up ready for a plank calf stretch, followed by daisy pickers and imperial walkers.

**Thang 1** - Through the fire

Circuit of four stations round the car park: 1 - Squats and standard merkins (20ea), bear crawl to... 2 - Star jumps and shoulder taps (20ea), crab crawl to... 3 - dips and diamond merkins (20ea), lunge walk to... 4 - American hammers and mountain climbers (20 ea in cadence), mosey round the pickle back to 1. Repeated about 2.5 times.

**Thang 2** - Danger Zone

Hi-tempo circuit, accompanied by the Top Gun soundtrack, on the basketball courts. Cycle of 20 reps each of raised merkins, dips, **t**uck jumps (or alternate), quite fast flutters (in cadence), followed by cycles of 15, 10 and 5 reps. Cycles separated by a sprint across the basketball court and back.

**Mary** - Anthem

Pierogi led with Freddie Mercurys; Flip Flop -> Shut-In called Beyonces; HowHow went with Homer to Marge and Buenos Dias with LBCs; Kickback introduced side-straddle-hops into the pantheon of Mary to remind us where we started; Ripcord took us out with a long set of 30 American hammers, deftly timed to the music.

**COT**

**Count-a-rama:** 17 **Respect:** 5

**Prayers:** Prayers for Magoo and his family, for Burt's colleague and her family, and for Quiver and his family.

**BOM**: YHC took us out.

**Wrap:**

Kudos and thanks to Burt and Shut-In for bringing a stack of red shirts for those who didn't have them, and great job to those who did!

Thanks everyone for posting today and allowing me the honor of leading you. I hope you all had as much fun as I did. MIAGD!
