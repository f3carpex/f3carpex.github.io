Second Q ever for YHC was to the point with some room for improvement. Cadence counts are getting better and everyone had fun... I think. It was quiet, not much in the way of mumble chatter for this beatdown.

Thanks to the 18 that showed for the track work and 22's. It was a beatdown and according to GTL possibly a new record for distance with the 3.5 miles we racked up.
