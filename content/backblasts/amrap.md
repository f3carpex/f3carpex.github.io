**Pre-Blast**

\- 16 HIMs we're reminded how valuable and necessary it is to be **self-motivated**. Every man's contribution of enthusiasm and effort compound together to build the incredible culture we share.

\- Todays theme: Show up ready to give your best and inspire the next man to give his best as well.

**The Warmup**

\- Pledge of Allegiance at the flag. - Run one, and only one, lap around the parking lot. - Circle up for: SSH, Merkins, LBC.

**The Thang**

\- YHC set up 12 stations around the parking lot marked by orange cones and labeled with an exercise. Each exercise is to be done AMRAP.

\- The exercises are: Pull-ups, Sumo Squat Jumps, Australian Mt. Climbers, Jack Webb's, Wright Flyers, Freddie Mercury's, Star Jumps, St. Merkins, LSF, Cinderblock Curls, Wolverines, and American Hammers.

\- Perform the exercise until YHC blows the whistle. Then, either bear crawl or crabwalk to the next station and begin the next exercise.

\- Perform two full rounds: no stopping, no ten-counts, no squat holds. Just work. Give your best - only you know if you did.
