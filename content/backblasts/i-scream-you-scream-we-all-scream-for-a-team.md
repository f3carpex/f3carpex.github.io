Coming off the hill Repeatos, @Imp said it best on the jog back to the Mary lot. "I freaking love that hill. It's the best part of this entire AO." I happen to agree. Let's see how we got there.

YHC rolled down Laura Duncan with a little Madonna's Like a Prayer blastin. There's a good backstory to why YHC loves that song but that's for another medium to be sure. Crest the hill and see a solid smattering of PAX milling about and parked cars. As some HIMs rolled in from a pre-run EC, Apex Parks and Rec showed up to open the gates much to our surprise. @hotspot and I opined about the width of the shoulder allowing for all this parking while the gate is closed. Disclaimer was stumbled through and first exercise of the Pledge of Allegiance to Old Glory commenced. With patriotism in our hearts and opportunity to become better men in our veins, we were off with a mosey to the basketball courts.

Warm Up: Good Mornings, SSHs, Sir Fazios, Fazio Sirs, Micheal Phelps, and Merkins

Thang 1: Triple Nickel ..... starting where you are, 5 carolina dry docks, run to the bottom of the hill for 5 squats, and run to the top of the other hill to the "speed hump" for five monkey humpers. Repeato 3 times.

Thang 2: Mosey to the picnic shelter for alternating left/right step ups, irkins, dips, left/right step ups, and derkins.

Thang 3: Mosey along the lake path to the bottom of Power Line Hill, @imp's favorite. 7s on the hill, merkins at the top and bottom. Lots of walkers, pups, cell phones, and sports bras. Mosey to the Mary Lot.

Mary: LBCs, WWIIs, Freddie Mercs, Box Cutters, Homer to Marges, and Boat/Canoes.

COT: 21 pax, several respects, lots of mehs and zippy hates. 2nd Annual Carpex Invitational Golf Tourney Oct. 5th. Prayers for all parents, teachers, and admins of kids of all ages elementary through college.

NMS: Been a minute since YHC has Q'd at A-Team. I was once a reg-u-LAR at the site as it is o so close to mi casa. However, I somehow got into a groove of taking Mondays as fartsack days. It can be somewhat counter-intuitive because F3 always starts my day off better than any other way .... well almost. So naturally you'd think a Monday workout jumpstarts the week off right. But I got into a rhythm that me being home Monday mornings helps set the tone for the week in my house. Getting kids moving or taken care of, while the M gets ready for work does wonders for my M. Getting lunches made and the dog walked and fed reduces a level of stress that I don't even understand why it's there in the first place, but it's not mine to understand. With everything in life, if you are in a position to help, then help.

Thanks, HIMs, for allowing to lead this morning and it was my hope your morning and week started off on a positive note.
