This will be YHC's 5th BackBlast written in the last 2 weeks. I'm beginning to understand now why some PAX are not a fan of writing them or choose to routinely skip writing them.  
YHC, Schlitz, and Joe Smith showed up early to get over 3 miles of EC in. It was Schlitz that also pointed out a used DNA Cocoon on the grounds of SWW.

## NMS

Special thanks to some of the Apexians that made the journey over to SE Cary to see me off!  
300 Curls is way too much especially when one of the PAX who was present is helping you move tomorrow.  
It's been great getting to you know you all in Carpex and I look forward to coming back to visit from time to time!
