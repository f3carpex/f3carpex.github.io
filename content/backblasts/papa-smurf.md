Surprisingly brisk mid-April conditions at North Cary Park this morning, so chilly even Ma Bell was wearing sleeves.

**Warm-Up** Mosey around The Pickle back to the flag and circle up for control freak Good Mornings, imperial walkers, burpees, copperhead merkins and squats.

**The Thang** Mosey down to the shelter for 11's (since Callahan says 7's aren't a thing), left-right step-ups in the shelter, hand release merkins at the flag.

Partner up, one partner runs The Pickle, one partner does irkins, dips and derkins.

Nine count from Ma Bell.

Mosey to the basketball court, one partner balls to the wall on the fence, one partner sprints to the end of the court and back.

**Mary** Circle up on the court for Homer-to-Marge, Freddie Mercs, dying cock-a-roaches, Hello Dolly and a couple of burpee burnouts.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  13 **Name-a-rama**:  6 RESPECT, 6 meh, 1 CallaHATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for PBX's FIL, prayers for Quiver's friend Ron recovering from a staph infection. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**  Chatty group this morning.

Burt brought the rubber ducky, Press On brought the duck call. Couple of Carrot Tops over here.

Great to see Quiver back on the good side of Wake County again.

I know most of you guys are faster than YHC, but ain't no way y'all were counting left-right as one on those step-ups.

Ma Bell and his nine counts.

Liverpool's M calls him Papa Smurf when he wears his fancy blue crocs. It's the coolest anyone's ever been while wearing crocs.

Ollie wasn't even there, but during Coffee Talk I heard two separate conversations about brutal beatdowns he dropped in the past. That's high impact, man.

Thanks as always to Coney for the Trunk coffee.

Love you guys!
