Hello Hell's Bells! Great way to start the week! Here's what happened:

10 studs and I gathered in the lot -- quick survey revealed no FNGs, bummer.... we said the pledge & carried our kettle bells 1/2 way down the lot. Brief mosey around the lot to circle up for the:

**Warm-up**: good morning, windmill, fazio/overhead/seal/alleluias/fazio backwards, plank, merkins, etc. Another quick mosey & gather for:

**The Thang**: wanted to bring something newish to HB, so downloaded a Tabata app -- we'd do 8 rounds of each exercise, 20 seconds on, 10 seconds rest....

Kettle bell swings, Split squats, Halos, Overhead presses, flutter kicks, merkins, rock your bodies (only 4 rounds) -- we did a brief mosey between the sets.... It was tough & yes, repetitive, but I think that's the point! Also, time flies when you are having fun with your friends & kettle bells!

**h** number-rama: 11, 3 respect, 8 meh

Announcements: May 1st -- Freed To Bleed blood drive -- see Slack or DM Petsounds for deets. Flacco coordinating Murph-A-Day in May - whew boy! I think there was one other I'm missing....

P/P: all unmentioned

Great day today! Super group of men I'm so proud to stand with!
