Life is a series of steps.  For the first 25 years or so, you are basically pushed down a series of steps.  Elementary school, little league baseball, driver’s license, first job, then usually college or in my case, the military.

In the Army, every step of your life is controlled almost 24 x 7.  My three years in the 82nd Airborne Division were challenging and fun but when I got out, the day I got out, the minute I signed my last form, I was lost.  I remember thinking there is no one to tell me what to do, when to do it and how to do it.  Luckily, I had a job waiting with a super-secret agency that again put me on a series of steps over the next 12 years.  Intense training, processing, overseas, move in two years, more training, back overseas.  You get the picture.

After leaving that very structured life and moving to North Carolina, I found myself wandering, kind of lost to a point.  Life did go on and time did pass but as I got older, I wanted something more.  Both in a Church and in my circle of people.  And out of the blue, I was introduced to F3 by Catniss.  The very first post so reminded me of Ft. Jackson, SC all those years ago.  The workouts definitely kept me coming back and as the next nine months passed, I find that I am now motivated more than before to get up out of the fart sack and make the most of the day.  I am striving to fulfill the common theme in the COT prayers of being a light to those around us.  I am working harder to lead my team at work with better vision and guidance.  I am working on becoming a more active participant in second F events.

Looking back at it, going to my first F3 work out at A-Team turned out to be one of the best steps I have ever taken.  Thanks guys.
