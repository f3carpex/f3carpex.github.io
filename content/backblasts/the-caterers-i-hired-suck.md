This morning I hosted (what may have been) the first ever Field of Dreams Welcome Party, which started 15 minutes prior to the workout. Invitations went out to the entire PAX however Ma Bell, Largemouth, Biner, PBX, Katniss, Bogo, Two Factor, Liverpool, Sosa,  Crimson & YHC RSVP'd.  We gathered in the parking lot and ran over to the shelter near the soccer field, but when we arrived I noticed the food I ordered from the caterers hadn't arrived yet. So while we were there we did 10 pull-ups. I thought maybe they delivered the food to the other shelter so we ran over there, but nothing. So we did Alt. L/R Step Ups instead. Back to shelter #1, no food, but dips. Back to shelter #2. Still no food, but Erkins. Back and forth we went, looking for the refreshments only to find the same thing over and over.

Hey look, it's 0542, Party's over.

YHC took us out with a quote from Roman Philosopher Seneca

> “We should every night call ourselves to an account;  What infirmity have I mastered today?  What passions opposed? What temptation resisted? What virtue acquired? Our vices will abort of themselves if they be brought every day to confession.”
