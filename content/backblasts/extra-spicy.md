**Pre-BB**

In 1785, William Cowper wrote a poem he entitled, “The Task.” In it, Cowper wrote the famous idiom, “**Variety is the very spice of life**, That gives it all its flavor.” And so it was that SNS this morning was Extra Spicy.

**BB**

When the guy who first invited you to F3 asks for help, you help him. I gladly said "yes" when Water Wings asked for a Q sub today. Thanks for comin' out, guys.

Great group pre-ran the Odyssey track ... shout out to the early runners.

As for SNS, YHC scoured the Exicon (f3nation.com!) to find new exercises we might not know to strengthen muscles we forgot we had. I think we achieved it...
