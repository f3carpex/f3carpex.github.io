So I learned what "shock & awe" pre-blast means to Flacco -- it means that he is going to hype an epic beatdown, then scoot out-of-state, give the ole neighbor a call to say .... hey, help a brother out & take my Q??

It's ok, he introduced me to F3 & I'm very grateful!  Also, the predicted rain held off & we had a lovely morning!

 

**Warm Up:**

Mozy to bank plaza -- why do we do that?  I couldn't see a thing!  (even though I thought I spotted a @Red Ryder

**Thang:**

Mozy to the Baptist church lot & partner up.

Round 1:  partner 1 runs to bottom of lot & does 5 burpies, partner 2 bear crawls the pickle until he returns -- flip flop

Round 2:  partner 1 runs to bottom of lot & does 15 sumo squats, partner 2 crawl bears the pickle until he returns -- flip flop

Round 3:  partner 1 runs to bottom of lot & does 20 CDDs, partner 2 lunge walks the pickle until he returns -- flip flop

Round 4:  partner 1 runs to bottom of lot & does 40 LBCs, partner 2 Berrie Sanders up to Academy Street & forward jogs back until he returns -- flip flop

Mozy to fountain

Thank you gentlemen – I heard quite a bit of grumbling in the mumble chatter, so I'll take that as a complement!  I got a ton of energy from you this morning & sincerely appreciate it!
