You know what we did and all of you are old timers as Beaker noted in Slack. Those that didn’t attend don’t need to know the details, but here is a summary:

4 corners throughout the park. Run, chest and shoulders, run, core, run, legs, run, practice what we learned.

**NMS**

Only Beaker kept this from being 100% respect

Franklin convinced me to get there early to start with FOD run club and get in a 2-mile EC before the workout. Great plan and I enjoyed the extra mileage.

Props to Zeke for joining us as well

Rumor was that Sky Blue was chasing Ollie, Sooey and Deuce for 5.9 miles and he finally caught them at the end.

Crimson narrowly avoided the jeep-sack and did manage to post with us

Not sure any of the PAX completed all reps in our 4 corners tour other than Beaker and yet he still finished first each time.

Pretty sure that I heard Goose is interested in taking the helm back as site Q at FOD if Beaker would ever give up the title.

Always an honor and a privilege
