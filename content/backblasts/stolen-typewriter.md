Roll into the Sovereign Grace Church parking lot and there's already a lot of activity. Some of the PAX are finishing up their EC pull-ups, and we've got a clown car from South Wake. YHC has just enough time to place cones in the parking lot, and it's time to go.

**Warm-Up**

Mosey down to the bottom of the parking lot and circle up for side straddle hops, hillbillies, plank jacks and Sir Fazios.

**The Thang**

I stole this typewriter routine from Callahan, he used it at one of his recent Q's. It sounded terrible, everyone hated it, I knew it was perfect for Tortoises.

Line up along the first set of cones, travel to the top of the parking lot, stopping at each cone to perform ten reps of an exercise. When you reach the top, say "DING!" and mosey back to the bottom.

Round 1: bear crawls and squats Round 2: lunge walks and merkins Round 3: bear crawls and prisoner squats Round 4: lunge walks and wide grip merkins Round 5: bear crawls and LBCs Round 6: lunge walks and American hammers

Throw in five burpees OYO after each round, just for fun.

Mosey over to the pull-up bars and partner up, size matters. Each partner does ten pull-ups (assisted if needed), then together each pair does ten parnter merkins, ten partner squats, ten partner big boy sit-ups and ten bropees.

Mosey over to the wall at the front of the church for BTTW with a five count down the line, peoples chair with a ten count down the line, and BTTW with a five count down the line.

**Mary**

Mosey back to the flag and circle up for the PAX to lead their favorite exercises, finishing with ten burpees OYO and Have A Nice Day.

**COT**

**Count-a-rama**:  16 **Name-a-rama**:  2 RESPECTs, 12 meh, 2 HATEs **Prayers / Praises**:  Praises for WWW's family returning home safely, prayers for safe travels for Ascot, Banjo and their families, and all PAX and families who are travelling over the next couple of weeks. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**

I need a refresher from Riptide on the partner squats, I don't think we did them right.

Red Ryder was there, Nerf was not. He must have been working. I didn't know they served breakfast at Arby's.

Tclaps to all the PAX who showed up early for EC pull-ups. I couldn't tell who was over there, but you have my respect. Theismann has started a new thing.

Texas Ranger brought his 2.0 Seahawk. He's a tough one, just like his daddy.

The three South Wake guys are named Lipstick, UTI and Peeping Tom. Carpex, we gotta step up our name game.

I asked the three South Wake visitors to call Mary exercises, the first one was the pickle pounder. I like these guys.

The typewriter routine is mostly Callahan, all I added was the "DING!"

I tried to break Crimson. I failed.

As always it was a pleasure to hang out with the Tortoises crew, thank you for letting me lead this morning.
