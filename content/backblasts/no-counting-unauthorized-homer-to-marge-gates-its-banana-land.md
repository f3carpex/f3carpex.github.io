This Guy! and Michelob, Largemouth and Chanticleer for a little EC run.

Hey look, 5 other HIM. Let's workout.

Mosey over the church parking lot. Some agility drills along the way, then circle up.

**Warm-Up  
**Good Morning, Windmill, Steve Earle, SSH, Mnt. Climber, Plank Jack

Mosey back over to the track around the field to count the number of fences and gates that are unnecessarily placed around the field confusing even the smartest among us. (hint: although it appears that you have to enter a gate from the parking lot to the "track" you'd be wrong. You're already on it. You just ignore the gates and fences and just run.)

**The Thang  
**Break up into two smaller groups and start at the North part of the track. One group goes East, the other West. A member of each group calls out an exercise for a cadence count of 3. Both groups meet at the South for 6x IC count of each group's exercise plus an extra one called by the Q. Groups go in the opposite direction stopping at East & West and performing 9x IC of the other group's called exercise. Then back to North for 12 x IC of all three previously called exercised plus a 4th called by the Q.

We repeated this 2 more times. I can't remember the exercises, but groups caught on quickly that the exercise they call for their own group to do 3 reps, the other group had to do 9 of them. So there was a little one-upmanship going on.

We then ran a full lap around the track for no particular reason

**Mary  
**Homer to Marge, repeat right leg up, repeat left leg up, 100's

**COT  
**No Announcements  
Prayers/Praises: Hi-Liter's business, The Commish and his M, those struggling with work issues due to COVID-19

This Guy! took us out with a quote from author Toba Beta
