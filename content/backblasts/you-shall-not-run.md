Unless of course you went to whatever that running workout is that meets on Wednesdays.  Combined with those people, SNS had 33.  For those that stuck with YHC, it was a no running workout.  As a reminder, YHC always takes requests.  And so when one of you scallywags asked for no running, that's what the PAX got: Bear Crawl 7s, a bunch of rock work (including curls, presses, extensions, rows, rock your bodies, rockees, rockins, rockroaches, you name it, we had it), and a little Mary.  Awesome to see so many new faces coming out.  Keep it up, men!
