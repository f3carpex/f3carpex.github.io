**Warm-Up** Mosey up to the front of the school and circle up for imperial walkers, arm circles, daisy pickers, copperhead merkins and copperhead squats.

**The Thang** Mosey around the school to the bus parking lot and count off 1s and 2s. One group BTTW while the other does 20 merkins, repeato with peoples chair and squats, then a lap around the buses. Repeato with 15 and 10 counts.

Mosey over to the back parking lot for island sprints, with 10 monkey humpers and 10 dry docks every time you return to the first island. Repeato with Supermans and Homer-to-Marge, merkins and LBCs.

Mosey over to The WWW Hill for sevens, hand release merkins at the bottom, jump squats at the top.

**Mary** Mosey back to the flag and circle up for dying cock-a-roaches, Freddie Mercury, box cutters, cox butters and victory burpees for tardiness.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  14 **Name-a-rama**:  3 RESPECT, 11 meh, 0 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for India. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**  I saw Bolton and Frisco running together, I bet that was a fun conversation.

Yoga Mat back in the gloom!

Remember when kids didn't actually go to school and we didn't have to worry about buses and teachers driving through the parking lot while we were getting after it?

I drove past two other Monday AOs to get here, and it was worth it. Great site, great PAX, great coffeeteria.

Love you guys!
