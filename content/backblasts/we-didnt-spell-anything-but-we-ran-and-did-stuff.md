As much fun as I had in Alaska (along with some work), I really missed my Carpex brothers and couldn’t wait to get back here. F3 is amazing everywhere, but it is so special here. The Slack banter across a gazillion channels, the dark side of GroupMe (not for all), the messaging of each other, Instagram picks, twitter announcements so that the rest of F3 nation knows us, pop up 2nd F events, mowing lawns, lending a helping hand whenever someone needs it, make our region so special. I am sure that there are other regions that are strong, but it is hard to imagine any group that is closer than we are, while still embracing all newcomers.

Thanks to the three groups that were working hard and listening to the Q at the pain stations.

Props to group that maintained constant mumble chatter because the workout was obviously too easy for them.

Thought about trying to spell something, but ultimately just tried to do some balanced work. Intended pattern was going to be upper body, legs, core, but I accidentally did merkins instead of LBCs and after that I was winging it.

After several months of reading Navin posts in Slack, I finally see him at a workout. Great to meet you brother and keep it up as you work towards your weight loss goal. Thanks for bringing FNG Poolie (slang for Marine recruit).

Coffee with Oofta was on point as always. I am embarrassed to admit that I didn’t latch on to the meaning of SWW’s EC name. Ranks up there with TCP Sawgrass

**If you are actually reading this and aren’t on GroupMe, you may want to check it out for a day. Some differences of opinion, but a great discussion as well as a really bad joke.**

An honor and a privilege to lead – as always
