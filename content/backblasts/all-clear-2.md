Nary a pax in sight. YHC covered about 4.5 Miles, stretched, took us out, and recovered the Flag.

Announcements. THE BULL April 1 in Durham, CARPEX cookout BOND PARK May 6th

Prayer concerns.  Nickleback and family. NB's father passed away unexpectedly Monday.

NMS.  After 7 pack last week,  it was a nice change of pace and YHC ventured into some uncharted territory.
