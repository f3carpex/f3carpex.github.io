Wow -- crazy fun morning at BO! So very much was happening & I'm not sure if I can capture half of it.... here's my version, my truth....

Men gathered at the flag, grumbling was evident as Flacco's presence looms large these days of May.... Murph on the minds of the PAX. We did the mission, the pledge, & were off to tour the town. Loop around & head to the bank for warm-ups -- executed under extreme mumble chatter -- it was awesome! Take the long way past the OG parking deck to the police station for Thang 1: (this is when Flacco learned we were not doing a Murph!)

21's -- 19 Aussie pull-ups on the rails, run downstairs for 2 dips by the fountain, run back up for 17 Aussie pull-ups, bear-crawl across the road & pack for 4 monkey humpers, back to rails for 15 Aussies, 6 dips, etc. -- yes, it was complicated & funny as nobody knew where their counts were... good times.... head to the grass lot for 100 burpees around the circle -- did pretty well on that one... mosey across the street for balls to the wall & people's chair repeats -- counting got super rough here as I just think maybe Riptide was having some fun with us...

Run the long way back to the flag, stopping for Billy Run in -- somebody (Callahan!) suggested that someone else was close to Merlot... so for the billy run, we had Hot Pants be a rabbit -- he'd get a head start & the rest of the PAX would try to catch him -- he'd have to do a merkin for each person that caught him -- he wasn't going to let that happen & he flew up the road, but then the wheels came off as he fell scraping up his hands, then merlot'd.... I felt badly about his hands. Ended with some Mary where Riptide didn't have to count his boat/canoes and Cally got to visit Dolly....

CoT: 19 (I think), 3 HONORS!! Bunch of Respects, some mehs...

announcements: check with Sooey for the Western Wake Food Drive info, Memorial Day Murph at HFT, Cally's 7 year Anni tomorrow at DZ - be there! I was presented with a body wash from Portugal care of Burt

P/P: Several moms & dads going through end of life challenges, praises for a man recovering from a suicide attempt -- lots of heavy ones this morning.

I have the honor of taking us out. Great crew, great morning!

Burt gave me a wonderful collectors edition Bud Light which was meh, Jigglepuff's coffee pumper had fallen over & it spilled out in his car during the workout -- it found it's way through the floor and looked like a big oil stain -- that should smell good later in the heat!

You're a great sport Hot Pants! Glad to be in the gloom with you!
