**When**: January 30, 2018 **AO**: FOD **QIC**: Biner

Arrived at FOD Tuesday morning to see the Cary police questioning several PAX. Nantan arrived and handled the situation. Read the rest of the story on the carpex-news channel.

**Warm Up**

One lap around the parking lot and across the road to the soccer field parking lot. 10 good mornings followed by 7 or 8 dirty birds\*.

\*shuffle in place, Q calls "turn" - turn right then back and keep shuffling  Q calls 2nd "turn" - turn left then back and keep shuffling, Q calls "down" - hit the ground and back up and keep shuffling, Q calls "jump" - jump and keep shuffling. That's one rep.

**Thang 1**

Over to the shelter for a circuit:

- 5 pull-ups
- 10 dips
- 15 merkins
- 20 squats
- 25 lunges L/R
- run around the parking lot pickle

Repeat 6 times, 7 if you're Beaker. To try to make it interesting, a 20 lb vest was added with the challenge to always have a PAX wearing and moving it through the circuit.

**Thang 2**

Over to the pitch for some HIIT. From the fence behind the goal:

- 5 burpees
- 5 wall crawls\*\*
- Sprint to mid-field
- 20 hammers IC
- 20 LBCs IC
- 20 heel touch IC
- mucho-chesto (10 regular merkins, 10 wide grip, 10 diamond, 10 offset right, 10 offset left)
- mosey back to the fence

repeat 3 times

\*\*wall crawl - plank position with feet adjacent to the fence. On "up" work up to the BTTW position and then back down to the starting position

**COT**

count-o-rama: 16

name-o-rama: 5 respects, 1 hate, 10 meh

Prayers for Goose's son

Thanks all for joining me and pointing out when I messed up the cadence call. It was a pleasure to lead; I was impressed...
