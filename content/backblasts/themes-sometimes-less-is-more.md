This guy! Michelob, Largemouth, Chanticleer and Blazing Banjo for a little EC.

Great group of guys this morning including a FNG. A disclaimer was given, and then a disclaimer about the disclaimer was given.

Today was supposed to be the day before This guy! and Michelob left for Boston to run a little road race they have there, and we had signed up to Q GT as a little sendoff. Then COVID-19 happened and so... but we decided to Q anyway.
