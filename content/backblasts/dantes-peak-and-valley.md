 Lots of mumble chatter this morning, it seems Frisco (verbally disguised as Sooey) wanted an easy workout, well we had too much to do for easy, but it was fun. We had 21 guys this morning with one FNG. T-claps to Theisman for some EC pull ups before the workout and to Water wings with a new baby (Congratulations man).

 Some EC for Crimson and me to run to top of the hill. I’m still thinking he should “Dukes of Hazzard” slide across Sooey’s hood when he stops at the stop sign. We will see what happens next time.

Pleasure leading this fine group this morning. Can’t have a good day without good mornings. Have an FNG who was killing it at the work out. Please welcome new F3 Snow Angel (Tim Shade). The hill climbs were very fun, minus the climbing part, and the descending part. The rocks were fun too, except for lifting them up. We announced the 1,776 workout on Wednesday and prayers for Disco’s M. Hope everyone has a great 4th celebration next week. It was a pleasure to work out and lead these gentleman this morning.
