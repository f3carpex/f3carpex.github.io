...that's kind of true, but when in doubt just reference the backblast.

On May 10th, 2017 a dude named Dice showed up to SNS on the invite of his buddy Jamie. It was weird because all the guys were calling him "Repeato," never the less, on a brisk (to me at the time) 54 degree morning I logged my first Carpex beatdown at the hands of a one "Earhart." Hello Kitty was born and I've mildly gravitated to F3 activities...

364 days later and it's an anniversary Q at that same spot, and why not just run that beatdown back over the Pax. As a tip of the cap to my Carpex brethren and the 20ish lbs I've dropped since joining your ranks, I thought appropriate to Q in a 20-pound vest this morning (thanks Elf). Get some!

It was a veritable buffet of options at Carpex's unofficial/official headquarters this morning:

- Ruckers left at 4 am for ruck the Maynard -- beasts.
- Maynard loopers left at staggering times to run and return by COT.
- Insomnias launched.
- Callahan and Disco worked the lot.
- Kitty went on recon.
- And it all culminated in a bunch of dudes posting for SNS while a handful rolled out for Vespers.

SNS was as followed as an o'ed to Earhart (present and accountable):

**Warmup:**

- Leave the lot and head to the Community Center lot for: Good morning, SSH, Cotton Pickers and High Temp Windmills
- Head out from the lot, left onto the street and down to the gate for 10 REAL burpees OYO.
- Mosey from the gate to the Kiwanis shelter.

**Thang 1:**

- L/R SU x15, Erkin x15, Dip x15, Derkin x15
- Take a lap
- Do that 3 times

**Thang 2:**

- At the boat house lot for 4 corners on the escalator
- 5 burpees +
- 10 jump squats +
- 15 merkins +
- 20 star jumps
- What goes up must come down, 15+10+5 back to corner 1
- When finished mosey to Carpex Stadium

**Thang 3:**

- This was added to the rotation this morning because Kitty's gotta throw a Kitty classic at ya
- Pax circle up for bull in the burpee ring -- get some!
- Finish our work on the field by bear crawling the hill

**Cool-down/Mary:**

- Billy run to the flag
- Earhart leads LBCs, Dying Cockroach, American Hammers and Have a Nice Day
- COT w/ a welcome to FNG's Shaqtus and Tomahawk.

**Announcements and prayers in COT, special note of:**

- Praying for Hotspot's mom, men an women in uniform, and special prayers for our brother Chinese Downhill -- we're always here for you, bro.

**NMS:**

I had a void in my life before F3, I knew something was missing, I didn't know what it was and quite frankly I thought I was "doing ok." Little workout at the gym, a run on the weekends. Just not good enough.

Men, I'm grateful for your friendship, your brotherhood, and most importantly your accountability. Iron sharpens iron, and for that, I am grateful.

\-- Kitty
