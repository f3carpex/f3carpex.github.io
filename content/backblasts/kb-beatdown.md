My first Q for Hells Bells. Focus was on HIIT with brief rest intervals.  I may have rigged the timer to make the 20 seconds longer and the 10 second rest shorter.

**Warm up**

Mosey around trail to pull up bars for 5x

Circle up and do Side Straddle Hop, Imperial walkers, Homer to Marge, 5 Burpees OYO, KB Halos, Runners Stretch and deep squat holds w/ KB

**Thang 1**

Turkish Get Ups with KB of choice

3x each side

Alot of moans and groans but this is one of the best full body exercises

 

**Thang 2**

Tabata (20 sec on with 10 sec rest for 6 reps with 6 stations)

KB Swings

Merkins

Goblet Squats

Curl and Press

Tricep extensions

Jump Rope

Mosey to pull up bar for 5-10 pull ups

 

**Mary**

Freddie Mercury

Homer to Marge

**COT**

Prayers for Largemouths Son, Disco Ducks Wife, Grease Monkey (Dad)
