Friday, February 1, 2019 - Cary, NC.

Those attending what was purported to be a high-tempo bootcamp workout at Gran Torino were shocked and amazed to arrive and discover the site had been taken over by shady characters wearing "military-style" backpacks. Assault backpacks, even. With carrying handles and other menacing features. They did their best to shrug it off and proceed with their running around, while the ruckers got after it.

The ruckers' purpose was two-fold. First, they got some miles in, with a few coupons sprinkled throughout the PAX. Expertly led by WWW, they carved a path toward the Preston Village circle and toward Davis Drive. Along the way, they stopped for two rounds of PT including such popular favorites as the squat, the overhead press (aka the Repeato), ruck swings, flutter kicks, and ruck merkins. All told, the PAX ground out just over 2.1 miles.

Second, the group took this #ruckership opportunity to discuss the week's QSource topic, Leadership Development Process (LDP). Some PAX who missed out on the Monday edition were able to fill their cup with hearty conversation, covering several angles on how leaders are developed, and how various organizations approach the challenge of developing leaders.

WWW delivered us on time and under budget to COT, where the GT bootcampers were once again gobsmacked by the Rolling Stone turnout. Smelling salts may have been deployed, but no permanent damage was done. Said one bootcamper, "why would you do that? All of you?" Indeed.
