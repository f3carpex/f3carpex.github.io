NMS: As of late most of my recent Q's have involved copious amounts of Bear Crawls. You can thank TEXAS RANGER for that. When he Q'd at Phoenix last he had us leave the park and go down to the Jersey Mikes parking lot then had us Bear Crawl back to the park entrance. I swear I think it took us damn near 30 mins to get back with many breaks taken. The Pax were determined to see it through. It was a gut check to be sure. I never thought we'd do that and I'd never do it on my own had it not been called at an F3 workout. However I felt like we'd acomplished something great that morning as small a feat as it was. I'm hoping that in doing so I can give some of the pax the same feeliing I had that day.

MIAGD!
