<table class="wp-block-table is-style-regular"><tbody><tr><td><em>"The weirdest workout I have been to so far"</em> - Biner<br><br>Today 15 HIM's took their DRP and posted at Gran Torino.&nbsp; YHC showed up hearing grumbles about "will he even show" despite being 5 minutes early.&nbsp; This is Carpex after all, we pre-funk every workout unless you are doing EC.<br><br>Starting off the workout with 3 minutes to reinstate the mission, do the pledge of allegiance, and making sure disclaimers were said, it was obvious they PAX were doubting the beatdown would live up to the High Tempo workout they showed up for.<br><br>This all changed with YHC pulled a bait and switch looking for someone to lead on the spot.&nbsp; Carpex OH (Original HIM) Burt stepped up and delivered the start to a high tempo workout.&nbsp; Doing this caused confusion, and strangely enough the mumble chatter was low, almost non existent. <strong>&nbsp;</strong>Warm up included:&nbsp;SSH, Cotton Pickers, Burt Jacks, Merkins, Goof Balls, Good Mornings, Mountain Climbers, a sprint and a skipper (who actually did the ruck).&nbsp;&nbsp;Excellence can only happen once, it was done already at GT it can only be a cheap imitation in the future.<br><br>The location of GT is a landscape full of opportunity for distance, challenges, and new adventures.&nbsp; Today, was not a day to fulfill the potential, in fact we could have achieved the same thing in the Harris Teeter parking lot.<br><br>As Burt finished the warmup, YHC took over and did Carpex's first prime ladder, this is something that can be repeated in the future and I highly recommend it.&nbsp; Often we fall into a trap of 7's or 11's, maybe increasing counts every light pole, or just repeating the same thing.&nbsp; That is from the standard playbook, effective, efficient, and easy to give instructions.&nbsp; Bringing something new to the PAX has a lot of room for failure, today was sink or swim.<br><br>Now that YHC was in charge again, it was announced that we would be running backwards for the duration of this exercise.&nbsp;&nbsp;Get into groups of 3 (just in case we need it in the future).&nbsp;&nbsp;Often overlooked is other creative ways to keep the PAX together as we move.&nbsp; Unlike running forward where the PAX is naturally divided into 2 or 3 groups based on ability, running backwards is a skill that isn't practiced, it burns, it sucks, and we all stick together.&nbsp; To make this more than just a calf and quad burnout, we did:<br>prime ladder of 2,3,5,7,11,13:<br>- 75 yard run (backwards)<br>- nipplers<br>- 75 yard run<br>- mack tar jai's<br><br>Little did the PAX know there was some pre-planned work with YHC and Burt to Co-Q the workout.&nbsp; After 20 minutes of the prime ladder, Burt took over and started with a plank session to learn about our zip codes and where we call home followed by one of the most disorienting set of disorganized 7's (not the usual “trap” as YHC described above) which was basically:<br>pick a random number between 0 and 6:<br>- run 150 yards in a 3 man indian run<br>- squats<br>- run 150 yards in a 3 man indian run<br>- hand release merkins<br><br>If you read that right, there was no pattern to what number of squats and hand release merkins we did, this was a great way to increase mumble chatter which was needed by this time in the workout.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping in tune with the high tempo theme, Burt kept the pressure on ensuring we didn't sit around waiting for others or doing "freed to lead" 10 counts.&nbsp; There were even random burpees, squat holds, and planks.<br><br>Time was running out, keep reading as there is a special event taking place in COT and we are still 5 minutes away.&nbsp; In our groups of 3, we did 3 sets of:<br>- 2 pax ran the 300 yard pickle<br>- 1 pax did 7 hand release merkins<br>- 7 squats<br>- repeat until other 2 come back<br><br>As we mosey to the shovel flag at the 40 minute time, the PAX is ready for Mary which unfortunately wasn't going to happen and the look of disappointment on the many faces was priceless (never fear, we actually did 40 American Hammers as the Ruckers joined the group). That disappointment was replaced with curiosity with YHC and Burt stepped into the center of the circle and announced it was time for the DTS (Duct Tape Shoe) award.<br><br>A bit of backstory here, the DTS award is a new award and there was a purpose for CK and Burt taking the Q today.&nbsp; Many years ago YHC had a favorite pair of shoes that had a hole and it was decided to duct tape the hole up.&nbsp; This worked well and as an unintended benefit added to the mumble chatter during the workout.&nbsp; In F3, we are inspired to be leaders, focused on building better men, and all show up outside regardless of the weather.&nbsp; F3 isn't a beauty pageant, it isn't a fraternity with a price tag, and it isn't a place where you are judged because you are not in shape, or forgot your gloves one day.<br><br>For YHC, the DTS is a sign of using the right tool for the job while spending time and resources to be a HIM instead of someone that looks good in the mirror with designer clothes.&nbsp; Burt has been around since the early days pre-Carpex (PC) and has always been a guy with no excuses, no frills, and always there for others.&nbsp; Burt has also been one of the driving forces of creating a culture of mumble chatter, looking out for other guys, and in this case always there to ask about my shoes.<br><br>One could list great attributes of all the PAX we workout with every day.&nbsp; Today we decided to honor two great men based on the F3 Credo:<br><em>"Leave no man behind, but leave no man where you find him"</em><br><br>As a symbolic gesture and to honor the work done, we took a vote in the circle for:<br>1) Left shoe: who leaves no man behind ?<br>2) Right shoe: who makes men right after the workout?<br><br>There was clear consensus and I am proud to announce the winners of the first ever Carpex DTS award:<br><strong>Hi-Liter (picking up the six...who was Burt)<br>Burt (always making men better)</strong><br><br>As always, it is an honor to be a member of F3 and having the opportunity to lead.&nbsp; If we offer too many awards they lose value, it is my wish that others see the opportunity to recognize a fellow PAX for their great work as a leader and inherit commitment to F3 and what it stands for.</td></tr></tbody></table>
