\- EC Pullups: Theisman, Red Ryder, Joe Smith, Parker, Bluewater - EC Run (that's right I said EC run): Michelob, Wonderbread, GTL, Hi-Liter, Snots, Chanticleer, Largemouth,     Denali & YHC

I've done a variation of this workout once before at SWW but I thought it would be perfect for Tortoises so I dusted it off, loaded up the Pontiac P.O.S with some fun toys to play with and the rest is soon to be Carpex History.

**Warm Up** In amazingly executed cadence, despite the high volume of mumble chatter we perform the following: Good Morning,  Windmill, Sir Fazio Arm Circles, Moroccan Nightclub, Steve Earle

**The Thang** With everyone standing around the circle I called out exercises to be completed AMRAP for 1 minute, except for those with toys to play with. They did 1 minute of the following:

– Agility Ladder – Quick Feet back and forth – 40lb sand bag w/ handles – Clean & Jerk – Jump Rope – 30lb sand bag w/o handles – Squat, press and slam - Battle Rope

The rest of the PAX did: Bobby Hurley, Merkins, SSH, 6″ hold Peter Parkers, LBCs, Burpees, Plank Jack, Goofball, Dying Cockroach, Mountain Climber, Run in Place w/ high knees & butt kickers, Plank Hold, Star Jumps, Crab Cakes, Diamond Merkins, Carolina Dry Docks, Wide Arm Merkin, Freddy Mercury, and a few others I can't remember. After each exercise we rotated clock-wise.

I often forgot to say "Recover" and Starting position, move" but _luckily_ Red Ryder was there to "help."

**Mary** Boat / Canoe; 100s; Have A Nice Day

**COT** Prayers for some brothers with job interviews. Prayers for Ascot & Chanticleer's Ms getting ready for their new arrivals.

**NMS** - My phone died just as I started to record Name-o-rama, so I apologize if I left your name off accidentally. - Welcome Tortoises FNG Denali. - Michelob led an EC Run that covered 1/3 of the Odyssey course. - Bidness was done!

YHC took us out with a quote from Explorer, Poet and Historical Badass Sir Richard Francis Burton

> Do what thy manhood bids thee do, from none but self expect applause; He noblest lives and noblest dies who makes and keeps his self-made laws.
