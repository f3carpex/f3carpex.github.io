Late last night as YHC was preparing to go downtown Apex to celebrate a friends Bday Hello Kitty DMs me and proposes the idea that we split up the pax where he Q them for half the workout and YHC would have the other half then we switch. Knowing I was not going downtown to drink milk the idea of a little help was attractive. The birthday was appropriately celebrated and YHC was left with just a few hours to sleep it off before my Q.

20 PAX showed up bouncing, many having already EC ran or rucked. It was all YHC could do read a motivational paragraph from Freed to Lead that reminds us that "staying in shape is a marathon that is sustained by discipline and a near-maximum effort virtually everyday of a man's life". But you know the PAX, they didn't need it. They were ready to roll. So we did.

Mosey over the community center for the Warm up

SSH, Burpo, Good Morning, Nancy Kerrigan, Steve Earle

Half the PAX back to Kitty while the other half followed YHC for Thang 1.

Thang 1

1-10-1 Burpo Ladder - This will be fun I thought to myself while I was planning the Q. Starting in the squat position we Burpo the number and recover to a squat position. 1, 2, 3... Right around 7 I was beginning to question my understanding of the word fun. At 9 most of us were sucking wind and needing a short breather in a big way. Ninjago was asked for a 10 count. He must have thought I was just being facetious because he raced to 10 and launched us right back into the ladder of pain. Most of us fell down the ladder but it was completed.

Mosey back towards the Community Center

Thang 2

Wheel barrow - partner up, wheel barrow 100 yards switching as necessary, plank hold for the six.

Mosey back to Kitty for the switch. The thought of doing another Burpo ladder with group 2 almost made me cry so I did what any desperate man would do, I handed the Q off to HI-liter, who really seemed to enjoy the ladder, to lead group 2.

Group 2 set out to complete Thang 1 and 2 while Group 1 partook of Hello Kitty's 4 corners of pain he had set up in the parking lot. Partner up.

Corner 1 P1- Squats, P2- AMRAP Abs, flap jack

Corner 2 P1- Pain stick lunges, P2- AMRAP Abs, flap jack

Corner 3 P1- Curls with Easy curl bar, P2- dito

Corner 4 P1- 25lb plate over head press, P2- dito

Kitty's roll of paper towels saved my life as I sprinted into the woods, dug a whole and executed 1 Al Gore.

Group 2 returned having done Thang 1 and 2 and a few bonus exercise courtesy of Hi-liter.

Mary - Mountain Climbers, Fluttering Superman, Fluttering Rocketman, Australian snow-angel, American Hammer, calf stretches and a Ninjago called Boxcutter.
