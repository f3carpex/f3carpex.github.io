**Francois** is your Q.

Repeato and Bartman for 60-pound sandbag EC.

**Warmup**: Kashmir on the Sonos for Francois' patented exercise calls.

**Thing 1**: Power Hour on the Sonos for rock work. Quite a playlist. 2 of the first 3 were Britney. There was some Ricky Martin, TLC, and a Backstreet Boys song. Nothing to see here, just some bros pressing rocks overhead while listening to "Livin La Vida Loca."

**Thing 2**: Dude Solutions for "Back in Black" and "Don't Stop Believing" while bear crawling, derkining, quick feeting, and box jumping on the lip of a curb so narrow that everyone wisely bailed out.

Out of time, mosey back to flag, have a nice day.

**NMS**:

Really funny and fun morning.

Enjoyed hearing from LaLoosh how much progress he's made in just his first month of F3. He's crushing it.

Glad to have Ramsay and Bartman setting their alarm a little earlier and hitting BiB.

Next week: Bluewater the Running Machine has your Q.
