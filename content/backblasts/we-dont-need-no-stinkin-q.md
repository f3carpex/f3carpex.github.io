Hot For Teacher 1/21/2021

Q: None!

PAX: Wahoo, Steaks, Quequeg, Oxtail, Flenderon and a fly by from Yahoo.

YHC has heard F3 lore of a "No Q" workout for many years now and has been wanting to run this for a while. The conditions this week seemed perfect, so run it we shall.

The principle of the workout is to ask PAX present to plan a 5-minute segment at a time ideally while someone is leading a segment so there are minimal breaks.I like how this parallels the 43feet philosophy of F3, with pax building the workout 5minutes ahead of the group.

YHC started with a Mosey to the Tennis Courts.

Before Warm-up I charged Wahoo with leading a 5 minutes workout from this location after
