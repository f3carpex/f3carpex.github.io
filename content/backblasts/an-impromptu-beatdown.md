Riptide was on the Q sheet. Unfortunately, his M is very sick and he wasn't able to make it. He did message the site q's in advance, but I didn't see the message until after the workout. Rooney had work early this AM, so YHC took the helm for a Q off the top of the dome. Here's what went down:

WARM-UP

Jog over to the Pre-School parking lot.

Mosey over to the Pre-School parking lot. SSH x 20, Good AM x 8, IW x15, 10 Burpees OYO, Standard Merkins x20, Hold Plank, Mosey back to the track around the park.

COT

Grateful for the pax bearing with me through a spur of the moment Q. Announcements included Sunday's Carrying Place Service and a Memorial Day Q in the works. Prayers for those struggling with Mental Health issues. Go check out the latest Pick Up the 6 Podcast on #F3MentalBattle. YHC encouraged the pax to never suppress a generous thought. God answers the prayers of others by prompting us to act.
