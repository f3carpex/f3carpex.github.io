Opening- Working on a short notice from Banjo that he couldn’t Q this morning, YHC quickly threw my name on the Q-sheet.  No FNG’s this morning.  No sense in wasting any time so recited the Pledge and let’s get working.

Warm-up- After a slow mosey around the pickle we circled up for a Crimson favorite of extremely slow Good Mornings, SSH, Sir Fazio, calf stretch, and windmill.

The Thang #1- First we counted off into two groups.  Everyone grab a bell of your choice. 

                First group ran to pull up bars for 5 pull-ups, while group 2 did deep squat jumps with their bell until the entire group returned. Switcheroo. 

                Next exercise was renegade row pushups on the bell, with other group doing more pull-ups.

                This continued with KB swings, curls, lawn mowers, tricep extension, squat thrusters, floor presses, and sumo squat high pull.  The other group alternated with pull-ups, lbc’s, and dying cockroaches.

The Thang #2- Frisco kept calling for burpees, so I delivered. 

We had 6 minutes until time for Mary, so time to start the stopwatch.  Completed 10 burpees and then rested until 1 minute was up, then completed 20 goblet squats and rested until minute was up, then 25 KB swings until minute was up. Repeato one more round. This quieted Frisco. 

Mary- It’s not a kettlebell workout unless we do American Hammers.  Earhart called them, followed immediately by The Joker for a second round.  Finished with Control Freak Merkins on your bell, because those are a Mary exercise. 

Announcements- Pickles is still needing assistance with SAG wagon for the Odyssey. 

Prayers & Praises- Congrats to Intimidator’s son for getting engaged!

Apologies if I missed anything else this morning!
