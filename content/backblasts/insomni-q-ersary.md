Last night, YHC went to bed and told the Mrs. that he would not be working out. It was our anniversary on Wednesday after all.

"Nope. I'm going to sleep in," I said.

Unless I was so excited and couldn't sleep in which case I might go to Insomnia.

"But fear not... I will be back by 6. So no worries. Sleep in."

And with that, Tuesday turned into Wednesday and 14 years of marriage came to a close.

* * *

Sometime that night, YHC woke up. Not quite fully awake but not quite asleep, I looked at the phone to check the time. 4:42AM. Damn.

"Let's see if I can get back to sleep," I thought, turning over and pulling the covers in closer. But, as with any good PAX, I couldn't shake the nagging feeling that I had (sort of) made myself and my M a promise. 11 minutes later, teeth brushed and running gear on, I was in the car, heading towards Bond Park.

With a few minutes to spare, I pull in, seeing the trusty mug of Callahan along with Ollie and Snots all stretching like the good runners that they are. Pulling on my gloves and wandering over, I said my greetings and joined in. Snots looked at me a little strangely.

"Didn't I see your name on the Q-sheet," he asked.

"No way. It's my anniversary today. I need to be back by 6. Insomnia or bust for me," I replied. Then I quickly ran back to the car to check said Q-sheet.

"Sheet," I muttered, peeling out and yelling good-bye. 5:04AM. Plenty of time... to drive to the ends of the world that are Lions Den!

* * *

Pulling in at 5:28AM (deer-karkas-removal-related detour...), I realized there was not much time for look-about. Luckily I posted enough with Burt and Flip-Flop to know what a cluster-Q looks like. Let's see what we can muster here.

Greetings and a Pledge later.... it's time for

### NSM

Really enjoyed this morning. It was a bit of a surprise for Jen to find me still not home by 6:30. Whoops.

It's been a wonderful day today though. Ups-and-downs. Hardships (dog to the vet) and chaos (dentist appointment for the 2.1 during conference calls). But lots of laughs and love. The kids asked the restaurant manager to do something special for us for our anniversary. Loved it. Couldn't ask for a better thing.

Thanks for letting me start year 15 with a bunch of dudes who will support me and push me but also show me that there's a lot of good to life.
