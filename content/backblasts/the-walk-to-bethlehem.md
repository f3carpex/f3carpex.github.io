Ma Bell and Term Paper are challenging the CarPEX PAX to team up for **The Walk To Bethlehem**. Over the 21 days of Advent, from Dec 3 - 24 track your physical activity. The goal is to accumulate **96 miles** (the estimated distance from Nazareth to Bethlehem) in any type of physical activity you choose, _including_ the steps you take during the day! Or you can choose just to include your workouts. We will stop at a "rest stop" every 12 miles along our 96 mile journey to celebrate our progress and to â€œshare a meal". Each time you accumulate 12 miles, please consider donating _at least one_ can to support Backpack Buddies. As you recall, we donated several bags of cans to FUMC Cary's Backpack Buddies ministry earlier this year. Let's do even more this time!
