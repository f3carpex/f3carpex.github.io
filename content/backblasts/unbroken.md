Full Metal Jacket, already an AO with a military theme, YHC was feeling especially patriotic after having watched the movie "Unbroken" last week on 4th of July.

Warm-up:

YHC announced the theme to a healthy sized group of 14 PAX (or was it 15?) and off we went. Warm-up took us on a run for a loop around the ponds, ending up back at the playground set where we did a few good mornings and plank-jacks. Then, it was time to partner up.

The Thang: Basically, a big circle with some pain stations along the route:

1) At the playground, with partners: 50 pull-ups, 100 merkins, 200 prisoner squats. Didn't take us long, so then we did "catch-me-if-you-can" for a fly-by of the camp gladiator crew. Partner 1 ran prisoner style with hands on top of head while Partner 2 did 10 merkins and chased down #1.

2) At the far side of the parking lot of camp gladiator, but still within view, we circled up and did some pickle pounders and homer to marge, just to let the CG crew see what they were missing. Then, we ran across the street to a nice sized hill.

3) At the hill we did a set of 7's: Carolina dry docks up top and burpees at the bottom. Then, it off to the track where we lined up in the infield

4) At the infield of the track, partner 1 sprinted across the field while partner 2 did WWII's and then they switched, 3 x each. Then, partner carry across field and back. Then, wheel-barrow across 1/2 field and lunge walk back.

5) Run back to the flag for a few Mary exercises and time was up.

COT. Announcements: Friday night crazy ruck train, check local listings (SLACK) for all the details; BBQ on sale Friday July 20th to raise $$ for an international adoption, check SLACK for more details.

Prayers/praises: Mississippi's family with his dad passing away and need for $$ to cover funeral expenses; Water Wings baby and wife doing well; pray for Goose's son with health challengers. YHC took us out.

NMS: Always an honor to Q. Thank you, gentlemen, for showing up and putting in some good work. If you haven't seen the "Unbroken" movie or read the book, yet, then you should. And, remember, in Christ, we are unbroken ... we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us and shed His blood for us on the cross.
