As I arrived at the Claymore, I thought I was going to be the first one there.  I was wrong, Disco Duck was waiting.  I didn’t just pull into the parking spot.  I drove around the AO to get the lay of the land.  DD gave me a perturbed look wondering what the hell is WWW doing.  There is a method to my madness.  As I drove around, all I can see is water everywhere … there was not a single dry spot. Luckily, we had the Scottish Hills Recreation Club across the street which was decent.  I had a plan.  I must be a softy because I audibled to minimize getting soaking wet and possibly starting everyone with a flu. No-will-do!!!  That’s why the Q has the ability and is Freed to Lead.

We began our journey to SHRC with some high knees and Sir Fazios (forward and reverse) until we got to our starting point.
