@mabellcarpex has encouraged all of us to get out of our comfort AO.  So being the compliant guy that I am....after much consternation I took Beaker’s Q and hit the trail to the far reaches of Western Wake County....which is Dante’s Peak.

Temperature in the high teens.  No wind.   Clear

Q was hungover or perhaps even a little drunk from last evening.

6 dudes.  One shovel flag.

**Warm Up**

- Mosey down to the cul-de-sac
- SSH, Burt Jacks, Mountain climbers, GM’s, Fazio Arm Circles, Cotton Pickers.  Mostly 15 and 20 counts.   In cadence.
- Indian Run to the Shed.

**The Main Events**

Tennis Court Work:

Set of 22’s.   Jump Squats and merkins.

Mary:  Low slow flutters, 6 in. leg holds,, LBCs,  rosalita x 15ish and 10 counts

Pax Call an excercise.    Run length of 5 courts.    Other Pax do the move.

We did:   Burbees, dying cock roaches, plank jacks, squats,  Freddy Mercury’s, ?

Dealer’s Choice Mary:   Big boy sit ups,  WWW2, dying cock roaches,  Peter Parkers, LBC’s,  ?

**COT**:
