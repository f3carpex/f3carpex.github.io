Hermes had a great idea a few months ago. All the BRR guys would grab all the Q spots for an entire week just prior to the race, and we do running workouts at every AO for the week. Well, YHC did his part. The original plan for the day was to do a Double 11's, but just last week, Ma Bell unwittingly stole my workout! Oh well, another plan lay in waiting for the PAX and this was it. A 9 Man BRR Team gathered at the front gate and took off running in one van only.

**Warmup**

A quick turn off to the parking lot leading to a nice pre-run warmup

- 15 SSH IC
- 10 GM IC
- 10 Hackey Sacks IC
- 5 Pike Stretches per leg IC
- 10 Butt Kickers IC
- 10 Say Hey Willy's IC
- 10 King David Kicks IC

**The Thang**

The Pax formed up at the top of the hill. 8 Pax took off in an Indian Run "Van" going deeper into the park. 1 Pax took off in the opposite direction on his "Leg" and around the front gate. When the groups rejoined, 10 Mountain Climbers IC, and the next PAX hopped into "The Van" and the next PAX took off on his "Leg". This repeated until all the PAX went. We met up in the side parking lot again for stretches and called it a morning.
