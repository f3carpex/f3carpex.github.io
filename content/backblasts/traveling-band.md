YHC woke up excited to Q his first kettle bell workout. Hopped in the car, pulled out of the neighborhood and glanced at the clock. 5:30. @#$% that's the starting time for Hell's Bells, I'm already late. Panic shoots through me. Then I wake up, for real this time. Grab the phone and see it's still four-something. Everything's gonna be all right.

**Warm-Up**

Every man grabs a kettle bell (a "travelling" kettle bell) and we mosey down to the circle for side straddle hops, hillbillies, Sir Fazios and cotton pickers.

**The Thang**

Grab your kettle bell and hold it over your head as we make our way up "the hill" to the corner. Knock out a few tricep extensions, overhead presses and goblet squats. Quietly, so we don't disturb Monkey Nut's neighbors. Head back down the other side of the hill to the basketball court, with some curls along the way.

At the court partner up. P1 BTTW while P2 farmer carries both kettle bells to the other end and back. Flapjack and repeato.

P1 people's chair while P2 does rows, five on each arm. Flapjack. P1 BTTW while P2 does squats with both kettle bells. Flapjack and repeato.

Grab your kettle bell and head down to the parking lot, sometimes holding over head, sometimes doing curls. Knock out some swings, tricep extensions, overhead presses, curls, goblet squats, rows and more swings.

Grab your kettle bell and head down to Bear Crawl Bridge, which we renamed Lunge Walk Bridge for this morning. Lunge walk across then knock out more swings, tricep extensions, overhead presses, curls, goblet squats, rows and more swings.

Lunge walk back across then carry over head back to the flag and circle up. Not time for Mary yet, let's knock out one more round of swings, tricep extensions, overhead presses, curls, goblet squats and rows.

**Mary**

YHC calls Freddie Mercurys (with the kettle bell), Monkey Nut calls LBCs (with the kettle bell), Earhart calls American hammers (with the kettle bell), YHC calls Have A Nice Day (without the kettle bell).

**COT**

**Count-a-rama**:  11 **Name-a-rama**:  2 RESPECTs, 9 meh, 0 HATEs **Prayers / Praises**:  Praise for Sour Mash's 2.0 Huffy finishing all tests and getting ready to graduate, praise for Pickles and Leprechaun escaping their weekend car accident uninjured, prayers for Crimson and his M as they travel back from Louisiana, and prayer's for his family in Louisiana as they deal with the loss of a loved one **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**

Term Paper showed up early to get a short EC run in. YHC did not take it as an insult, but was pleased to see how worn out he looked at the end of the scheduled workout.

YHC was unable to keep the kettle bell over his head for the entire trip from bridge to the flag, but Red Ryder was. Strong!

Big thanks to Earhart and Monkey Nut for getting this AO going and providing most of the kettle bells. There is no other workout in Carpex like Hell's Bells, and I'm glad it's continuing to grow. I encourage everyone to get out here and check it out.

It's always an honor to lead this group of amazing men.
