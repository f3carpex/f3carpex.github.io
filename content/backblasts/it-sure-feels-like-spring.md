As I am awoken from a restful nights sleep post holiday party, I roll out of bed, check the weather and am giddy that I’ll be able to feel my fingers during the entire workout! Spring is here... for the day at least.

With that I head over to SWW a bit early, taking in the sites and sounds of the gloom, and confirming my Q.
