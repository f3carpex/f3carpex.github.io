Due to joining a Bible study group which meets on Tuesday nights, YHC hasn’t been able to be in attendance at the infamous downtown Cary location that is Rush Hour in a while. But given that this day (4/6/21) marked my 4th year in F3 Carpex, and the fact that I planned this out at the beginning of the year, I was not going to miss it! I had already Q’ed once this day in the early morning at FWD. (You can read about that one here: [https://f3carpex.com/2021/04/10/fourth-year-celebration-part-1/](https://f3carpex.com/2021/04/10/fourth-year-celebration-part-1/)). But to make this day even more epic I decided to do a Part 2 on this same day for the evening gloom!

YHC arrived a little early to scout out a specific area, and after that Cauliflower arrived and we took an EC lap around the main buildings. As the time drew closer to 6:00 Clockwork joined us, and that would complete the pax for the evening.

We knew the mission and disclaimer, so when the bell chimed we recited the Pledge and headed over to Cauliflower’s truck to each get a cinder block for the beatdown.

_**Warm Up:**_

After running to and stopping at the big fountain we did:

- **Good Evenings**
- **SSH**
- **Hillbillies**

_**Thang 1:**_

This routine took place with our blocks on the hill in the parking area between the Community Center and our favorite parking deck! The exercises done are as follows (The “B” represents the exercises done with the Blocks.

Next we took a **Fellowship Run** all the way up the parking deck, then performed some curb D**ips** and **Quick Feet**.

_**Mary:**_

Back at the big fountain we just did a round of **100’s** since we had done a lot of Mary exercises already. After that we did 1, count it 1, **Burpee** and some **Stretching** to finish out the time.
