Little thick out there this morning. Little thick.

**Warm-Up** Mosey around the lot next to the astroturf field and circle up for imperial walkers, daisy pickers, arm circles and burpees.

**The Thang** Run up the hill to the next parking lot and back, stopping on the way down at each light pole for various exercises (merkins, LBCs, monkey humpers).

Mosey to the shelter and partner up. P1 takes a lap around the lot, P2 does irkins, derkins and dips until relieved.

Mosey over to the astroturf field, bear crawl sideline to sideline, stopping at least twice for 10 Homer-to-Marge. For the return trip it was lunge walks and Supermans.

**Mary** Circle up back at the flag for pax led exercises, including Homer-to-Marge at least two more times, and just enough time for Scuba Buddha.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  14 **Name-a-rama**:  5 RESPECT, 9 meh, 0 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Lots of pax with family members going through different trials. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**  Always fun to get back to FOD, the OG site I visit the least.

Lots of guys this morning complaining about their Spartan experience over the weekend. Not normal complaining, but that special F3 kind of complaining that makes you want to do it yourself.

The humidity and hills had us soaking by the time we reached the field. Doing Homer-to-Marge and Supermans on the cool dew of the astroturf was glorious. You're welcome for my leadership.

Love you guys!
