It was a beautiful morning to get our body, mind, spirit right. YHC/QIC had a plan for some KB deck of pain. The pax did not know it yet but they were going to get some time to lead during the workout.

**Warm Up**

We moseyed to the circle area for to warm-up. GMs, Cotton pickers, Sir Fazio arm circles forward and back and some overhead claps.

**The Thang**

After the quick warm-up, we mosey back to the shelter to begin our routine. Before we started, I got Pandora on the iPhone rocking to some good ole AC/DC rock & roll on the speaker box to set the mood right. Pain routine is as follows:

<table><tbody><tr><td width="208">Set 1</td><td width="208">Set 2</td><td width="208">Set 3</td></tr><tr><td width="208">Diamonds: Goblet Squats</td><td width="208">Diamonds: KB Swings</td><td width="208">Diamonds: Nut Crackers</td></tr><tr><td width="208">Hearts: Curls</td><td width="208">Hearts: Lawn Mowers</td><td width="208">Hearts: Tricep Kickbacks</td></tr><tr><td width="208">Spades: Overhead Press</td><td width="208">Spades: Overhead Press</td><td width="208">Spades: Overhead Press</td></tr><tr><td width="208">Clubs: Flutter Kick w/press</td><td width="208">Clubs: American Hammer</td><td width="208">Clubs: LBC</td></tr><tr><td width="208">Aces: 10 burpees</td><td width="208">Aces: 10 burpees</td><td width="208">Aces: 10 burpees</td></tr><tr><td width="208">Run/Walk</td><td width="208">Run/Walk</td><td width="208">Run/Walk</td></tr></tbody></table>

After each run/walk, we would rotate so each pax can pull 5 cards and lead the workout. After Round 3, repeato back through. At 06:05 hrs after the set 5 run, we circled up to honor our favorite gal, Mary. Each pax lead their favorite exercise of 10 reps (IC or on their up).

**Mary:**

YHC took us out thank the Lord for the many blessings to be able to wake-up each morning to meet-up F3 style. It was a pleasure to lead the HIMs this grand morning. Until next time!
