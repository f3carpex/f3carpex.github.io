Perfect morning at FWD!  Site I don’t get to a whole lot – great to get together with some fine high-impact men.

14 HIMs gathered -- No FNGs, only familiar faces.  F3 intro given & we started with the pledge.  Moseyed around the parking lot & painted some lines.  With all that running out of the way, we rolled into:

The Warm Up

Circle up for SSH, good mornings, windmills, imperial walkers, hill billies, calf stretch merkins, etc.  Mosey up the greenway for:

Thang 1 –

Modified 7’s on the hill up to the bridge – descending Burpees at the bottom with 5 pull-ups on the bridge each round.  Good work done here….

Mosey back toward the flag with a stop half way for the much-requested side plank star crunches – good times!  Regroup there for:

Thang 2 –

Everyone picks their favorite concrete ball – copperhead irkins, left-right steps ups, dips, and derkins were done – mosey over to the basketball court for suicides alternating with some more moseying.

Stayed at the basketball court for some Mary – Dying Cockroaches, Homer-to-Marge, Little Baby Crunches, Supermans, & H-A-N-D.
