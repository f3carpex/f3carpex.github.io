Had to do some Chilcutt's and N'Diayes for the State vs. Carolina game tonight. Heels need all the help they can get. Picked up Captain Kirk; his Dremel is fixed (thanks Slappy) and he is getting carried away with stripping paint off of his mantel, kitchen cabinet, window casing, door molding.  
It has been an awesome 3 months. I have drawn inspiration from fellow PAX'ers; received countless support; and have grown as a spouse, father, sibling, and friend. Thank you all.  
FRED is my truck.
