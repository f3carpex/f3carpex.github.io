Who are all these guys? YHC clearly needs to go to Slippery When Wet more often. There are at least 4 PAX that I've never had the pleasure to meet previously. However, with all the newer PAX, as the clock reached 0545 there were no site Qs or shovel flags in existence. Therefore, a form of the disclaimer is exclaimed, and YHC stated the mission of F3 (Hermes was given a shot at the mission, but failed. The only point in the morning where he was at a loss for words).

### Warm Up

30 SSHs.

0 Tappy Taps

### The Thang

The Murph

Broken up into 4 x 5 sets of 5 pull-ups, 10 Merkins, 15 Squats. PAX were encouraged to help each other when it got difficult. All done to the dulcet tones of Jon Bon Jovi.

### Mary

100s

### COT

- 3 Respects, 3 Hates, 15 Mehs, 1 Joe Smith in flip flops
- No announcements, praises that Chipper's M is improving.
- YHC took us out

### NMS

YHC had the Q here a few months ago. At the start, PAX selected one of 2 envelopes. The envelope selected contained a workout that was not the Murph. The other envelope, however, would make it's triumphant return today. Much chatter was mumbled as the PAX (read: Hermes and Term Paper) realized what was happening. The PAX got stronger and faster, so mission accomplished. Not sure how Betsy Ross got his name, but watch out for this guy. He's doing good stuff.

We got better today. Don't stop there - always be accelerating.
