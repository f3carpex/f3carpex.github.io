Beautiful morning at Hell’s Bells for some fun!  My first kettleball workout Q, so I did my homework & hoped to do a proper job….

14 HIMs gathered -- No FNGs, only familiar faces.  F3 intro given & we started with the pledge.  Moseyed around the pickle – front/back/left/right, etc…. With all that running out of the way, we rolled into:

The Warm Up

Circle up for SSH, prisoner squats (deep stretch style), homer-to-marge, lunges, hip rotators, merkins, and spidermans.

Thang 1 – 3 times

We split into two groups:

Group 1 did kettlebell work:  8 Halos, 10 Goblet Squats, 8 each side overhead presses, 15 swings, 8 each side bent over rows, and 6 each side reverse lunge.

Group 2 did agility work on three planes:  1 min mountain climbers (straight ahead motion), 1 min skier (side to side motion), and 1 min of step-thrus (twisting motion)

Repeato so each group rotated through the exercises for 3 sets.  In between we did little moseys and the ole side plank star crunch.

Head to the flag for some Mary with kettlebells – American Hammers, LBCs, Low slow flutter, Homer-to-Marge, H-A-N-D.  Thanks EarharT for the assist with hammer Mary!
