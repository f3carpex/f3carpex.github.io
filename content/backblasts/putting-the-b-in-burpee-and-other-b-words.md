I never know exactly how many PAX are boot-camping and how many are Vespering, but there were 20+ gathered at Bond Park expecting some sort of exercise routine.

## Warm Up

A couple laps around the pickle to get the gams loose. Do the Pledge and recite the F3 Mission, circle up for SSHs, Sir Fazio forward and back, Seal claps, Steve Earles, Plank Jacks, and CFMs.

## The Thang

Mosey down to the end of Maury O'Dell, hang a right and go to the nicely lit parking lot adjacent to fields 5/6/7. Now give the disclaimer. Partner up for a round of Dora: Partner 1 completes 100 Burpees, 200 LBCs, and 300 Jump Squats while Partner 2 runs the pickle.

Once complete mosey back toward the flag, stopping along the way at 2 streetlights to allow Ma Bell to lead us in 10 x his fav Merkin, the Copperhead, then 10 x of his second fav, the World's Worst. Once we arrive at the flag, do the SNS Shuffle the remainder of the parking lot: L/R lunge steps followed by a burpee.

Run two cool down laps until Ma's Strava hits 2 miles, then circle up.

## Mary

Captain Thor from 1:4 up to 10:40. Have a nice day.

## COT

26 total, one Hate and a whole pile of Respects. Old Maid for a Bruisers workout while recovering from a sore foot.

Prayer requests for How How's family, all of our brothers who are banged up, and all the guys who need F3 and we haven't found yet. YHC took us out.

## NMS

- I'm kinda liking the Deconstructed Disclaimer
- Flip Flop was bordering on late
- A LOTTA mumbling about burpees in a Dora.
- Had a lot of fun talking to Burt this morning.
- Yes, I know I don't post here very often. Thanks for pointing that out.
- T-claps for Wahoo for packing a lunch and driving over from Apex.
- Be just a LITTLE better today than you were yesterday.
