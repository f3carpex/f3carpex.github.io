Hall of Famer Yogi Berra was once asked if he wanted his pizza pie sliced into 8 or 16 pieces... Yogi replied “ya better make it 8, I don’t think I can eat 16”.

Sometimes the numbers can be deceptive so when we began our Claymore beat down with a partner combined 200 burpees, a few of the pax gave me stares and some a what the... look. Broken down to 10 sets of 10 sounds better right? Or @crimson 20 sets of 5. The bottom line is everything we do is a mental game. The six inches between our ears is truly the only distance that matters.

I decided to emphasize on the the importance of the partner workouts. We push ourselves and we need others to push us as well we need to push others. Today’s Q emphasis was all about pushing each other in order to get stronger.

Warm-up blah blah blah... deconstructed burpees

Thang 1: 200 curb-hop over Burpees w/ a partner @pickles was the man! Way to push! Oh, I almost forgot the one extra burpee we did at the end because “Thunderstruck” was jammin and we had to honor @www

Thang 2: 300 Squats w/ a partner

Thang 3: 100 Merkins just for fun ;)

The Playlist was your typical AC/DC, KISS, VanHalen blah blah blah relaxing music for “Have a nice day”

Back to the flag for Pax lead Mary! Announcements: Stations of the Cross Friday, F3 Dads Sat www has the Q
