I've been enjoying the "limited" run bootcamps -- Tortoises, Tin-2-Iron, Hells Bells -- as I need to limit my miles while still getting out with you men. Was thinking of something new to try & decided to give it a go with the men of Tortoises this very gloomy but warm morning. Here's how it went down .....

The gathering: My GBB & wheelman today, Flacco & I came into the lot hot as our little neighborhood carpool hit a snag kind of like a container ship in a canal. Ok, not that bad, but a PAX who knows who he is overslept -- Flacco made two trips to the driveway but was only answered with darkness.... so, -1 on the count so far and I was worried that Shut-In's challenge would fall short at 149. Expecting a big crowd with the challenge laid down, I was a bit worried about how many cinder blocks were hidden at the church. We pulled in to find 3-4 stalwarts getting ready to go... hmmm, I think we'll be fine on the blocks. I should have know some drizzle in the forecast would take out a big chunk of Carpex....

Started with a brief disclaimer as the rumored FNG did not materialize, mission, and pledge. Mosey around the pickle & circle up for the basic warm up stuff with emphasis on shoulders. Up to the church to hand out cinder blocks for our thang:

**First round**: 1 minute to do 5 blockees and 10 block curls -- if you finish inside the minute you earned some rest! Repeat 6 more times. Mosey pickle.

**Second round**: 1 min for 5 burpees & 10 block overhead presses -- total 7X. Mosey pickle.

**Third round**: 1 min for 5 rock-your-blocks and 5 deep as you can slow squats with blocks -- total 7X. Mosey pickle.

**Fourth round**: 1 min for 10 merkins & 10 block rows -- total 5x as we were running tight on time & I was getting tired of my block. Was glad we started with the first pairing as it was tough....

Carry blocks overhead back to their cave & circle back up for mary...made the mistake of asking Flacco to call a mary while I collected my phone & bluetooth speaker (did the workout to the outstanding Spotify playlist -- Hot for Teacher). While I had managed to keep us off the ground the whole time, Flacco calls Homer to Marge to soak up the parking lot into our shorts. I finished up with my latest creative expression -- The (soon to be) famous "Plank You Very Much" -- plank, right arm up, regular, left arm up, regular, right arm & leg up cadence crunches, regular, left arm & leg up cadence crunches -- Hi-Liter loved it!

**Count-a-rama**: started with 8, picked up Water Wings on his run & he finished up with us -- total 9. I got to meet Egon for the first time and we have a Bolton sighting to report...

**Announcements**: 2pm Sunday -- Carrying Place lawn care 3rd F. See the Carrying Place Slack channel for deets and equipment needs. This happens every other weekend through the Fall. Please come out & help -- good F2 too!

**Prayers/Praises**: Praises for progress to dat and prayers for staying on track to Bubba's son Derrick. Derrick is going though drug rehab and is making great progress after a few set backs. Please pray that this young man stays on track and for his family that has been through so much over the years.

I really enjoyed this morning -- Motley Crue chat was on!
