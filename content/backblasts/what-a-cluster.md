Here’s an idea; pax show up and we put all of their names in a hat and draw at random to lead parts of the beatdown. Aye? Aye!

22 on hand, 1 is an FNG. Quick disclaimer and send the men to the library.

Warm ups: Pickles

Cluster 1: Burt is pulled and he calls random Jack Webb’s ... signature move

Cluster 2: Red Lobster gets pulled out of the hat and takes the pax to the fountain for 3 rounds of bear crawls and lunges while partner pax amrap exercises.

Cluster 2: Hand off to Biner who takes the pax down to the school field for sprints and stuff.

Cluster 3: Wallaby gets to bring the pax home with stops along the way.

Mary Cluster: Cataracts on the billy run and Mary lead.

COT Cluster: WWW took us out!

Welcome FNG, you guessed it... Cluster

MIAGD, fellas!
