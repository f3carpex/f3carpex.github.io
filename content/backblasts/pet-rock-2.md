8 HIM gather in the gloom for another Claymore, limited run, beatdown care of Earhart.  Welcome to FNG Caddyshack, who received the disclaimer (mostly) and then we performed the Pledge.  After a quick lap around the upper parking lot pickle, we circle-up for

## Warm Up

  
Good Mornings

Sir Fazio

Imperial Walkers

Cotton Pickers

## The Thang

Done with warm-ups, we head over to the park’s lovely rock and flower garden to pick out a traveling rock.  TRAVELING ROCK!  We take the rock, overhead into the baseball field and over to the backstop padding for 3 rounds of (We run the bases between each set for a little break):

Rock rows

Arm Extensions (5 count down the line)

Overhead (5 count down the line)

Curls for Girls

Grab your pet rock and exit the baseball field over to the bleachers, putting your pet down and out of the way.  Time for 3 rounds of (running to the upper parking lot a nd back for a break):

Left right step ups

Bench-top irkins

Dips

Dirkins

Finally down with the benches go back and get your pet rock.  We now travel to the lower parking lot for some escalator work with our now all-too-familiar pet rock.  Q calls for ascending rock-your-body workouts (adding one per parking lot line) while moseying back to the beginning of the lot where you turn around, find your pet, and lunch longingly toward him (or her).  Keep going back and forth until all PAX have finished 8 rock-your-bodies. 

Now we need to descend the escalator so more rock-your-bodies, this time decreasing the number of rock-your-bodies until you reach one.  Since we just had Easter, this round the PAX were told to bunny hop (or modify as needed) back to their pet rock.

Now it is time to head back to our garden, so we mosey with our rock back up the hill, mixing in tricep and curl work until we reach the rock pile.  Down on your six for:

## Mary

Since we have our rocks, Q calls for

Hammers

LBCs

WW2 Sit-ups

Flutter Kicks

Bell tolls 6:30 and time to finish.
