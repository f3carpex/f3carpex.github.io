A half dozen High Impact Men came out to the sunniest gloom in all of Carpex to get stronger. Let's go!

**Warm-Up** Mosey around the Page-Walker building and circle up for side straddle hops, imperial walkers and cotton pickers. Here comes Ollie and Mojo, so let's do another round.

**The Thang** Mosey over to the big fountain and split into two groups, one group AMRAPs dips while the other group runs up the stairs and around the courtyard, then flapjack. Repeato with step-ups, irkins and more step-ups.

Mosey around to the other side of the buildings and circle up for LBCs, copperhead squats, copperhead Supermans and copperhead merkins, so much fun let's do it again.

Mosey over to the pocket park, one group AMRAPs dips while the other group bearcrawls across and runs back, then flapjack. Repeato with lunge walks and step-ups, bearcrawls and irkins, and lunge walks and step-ups again.

Mosey over to the railings near the flag for what YHC calls The Ollie, 10 Austrian pull-ups and irkins, then 9, then 8, all the way down to 1. But the QIC's counting skills are not up to the challenge, so just do a few rounds of random repetitions.

Mosey around Page-Walker again back to the pocket park and circle up for dying cock-a-roaches, copperhead squats, copperhead Supermans and copperhead merkins.

**Mary** Mosey around the building one more time and circle up in the pocket park for LBCs, Freddie Mercury, Homer to Marge, box cutters and here comes Bartman just in time for cox butters and Have A Nice Day.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  6 (plus Bartman) **Name-a-rama**:  No RESPECT, 4 meh, 2 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Continued prayers for Crimson and his family, continued prayers for our brothers recovering from injury, continued prayers for YHC's M and 2.0. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS** It was fun to workout in the sunshine again.

Great group of guys tonight, and it seems like weeks since I've seen them, nice to reconnect.

Can't believe I messed up The Ollie, with Ollie standing there watching me. I need to practice.

Captain Kirk reminded us that today is Taco Tuesday, so be advised.

Thanks for coming out tonight men, I truly enjoyed it.
