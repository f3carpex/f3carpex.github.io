BO was my first Carpex post, 4/28/16. MCants had the Q. He was so cool to me and made me feel part of the PAX immediately.

 

5:45rolled around and off we went, headed to school and did some warms up, 23 Merkins for Gibson. We then did so 4 corners work for Ma Bell, then we did some running work with Mary mixed in, then some dips and squats by the water fountain. Next was some light pole work with Merkins that had to be modified because of some complaining! Last was a hill work to COT

 

Men I'm so thankful for all of you, F3 is a huge part of my life and if I can ever help any of you just reach out.
