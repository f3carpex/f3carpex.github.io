Over on the Dark Side of Cary, 14 HIM were volun-told by YHC what to do at Kryptonite. We gathered at the flag and excitedly waited for the EC runners to arrive. Then we listened to Hermes talk about his 5k PR and how he was going to take it slow on the main event. Being the ever-benevolent Q, I agreed to keep it to a reasonable pace (or I just leveraged the moment to subtly admit how slow I am...) We celebrated leadership in our community by delegating a pearls-on-a-string workout to the PAX. Off to the first parking lot...

**WarmUp**

Run to the first parking lot...get in a couple of loops just to boost mileage...  
Breathe! Breathe in the air! Don't be afraid to care. Leave, but don't leave me...or any man behind.  
A little yoga stretch, some good mornings, some merkins, a couple of runner stretches, some calf work...and we're off!

**Tha Thang**

Let's run around the Regency Pkwy circle, 2.08 miles...plus a little to get us up to 3+ miles per the minimum required standard of any respectable high tempo AO. Every .2 miles or so, one PAX call 10 reps of whatever they want. Delegation. There were 15 of us...do you honestly think I remember the 14 exercises called??? I'll give it a shot (not necessarily in this order):

1. SSH
2. Squats
3. Squat jumps
4. Scorpion CDDs
5. Catalina Wine Makers
6. Hand release Merkins
7. Mountain climbers
8. Peter Parkers
9. Merkins
10. Imperial Walkers
11. Hillbillies
12. WW2s
13. LBCs
14. Nipplers

Finishing at the next parking lot up from Koka Booth, we raced back to the flag. YHC won. YHC might have been the only one racing. YHC don't care.

Mary - a little of this, a little of that - the Q had to do SOMETHING, after all.

Announcements: April 2 Stations of the Cross at Danger Zone; Squatter and Michelob are manning an aid station at the MTS 100-miler and will support our brave brothers, notably GTL taking on the full 100.

Praises and Prayers: for fatherhood
