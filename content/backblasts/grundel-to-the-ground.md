Well its both hard to believe its only been a year and hard to believe a year has gone by. Having been while since I've Q'd, I decided to pick up Dante's Peak for my F3 Anniversary. I arrived a little early to sort out and finalize my plans with a short EC around the site getting in a few pull-ups and scaring something that sounded larger than it should have been in the woods by the amphitheater (or did it scare me?).

#### Greet the Pax at the Flag start with the pledge and mosey to the other end of the parking lot..

### Warm Up:

- Side Straddle Hops
- Good Mornings
- Runner stretch - _where Track Star encouraged the Pax to get their "**grundel to the ground**"_
- Calf Stretch
- Merkin
- Virtual Jump Rope - _Thanks Shut-In this definitely got the mumble-chatter going and killed any sense of order I might have had... onward_

### Main Thang:

Make our way down Bear Crawl Bridge past the pond and up into the top lot. Pick a partner.

4 Rounds;

- Partner 1 Run the Big Pickle - almost to the shelter
- Partner 2 Bear Crawl/Crawl Bear/ 4 Corners - Each round/Corner has a different exercise 4x in each corner
    - Nolan Ryans
    - Merkins
    - Catalina Wine Maker
    - Plank Leg Raises

### Other Thang:

Mosey to the shelter and picnic tables for a set of 11's

- L/R Step-ups on the picnic tables
- Dips amongst the sprinklers/geyser in the amphitheater

### Last Thang:

With 3-4 minutes to go line up for an Indian Run back to the flag

### Mary:

Outta time

_Then the following activities occurred in this order - as I said it had been a while since I Q'd and I was a bit off after coming in hot on the Indian Run_ - Free to lead right

#### **Announcements/Prayers**

#### **YHC took us out**

#### **COT**: 10 + Hello Kitty who wrapped up a week of IronPax catch up

_Thanks to Smithers and Wahoo for getting me out in the gloom a year ago and all the other Pax I've met along the way - I've since posted on both the east and west coasts, increased my pull-up count 7x and discovered I could run, sometimes up mountains._
