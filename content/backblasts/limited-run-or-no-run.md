Earhart and I did some EC and arrived 8 minutes early to scout the potential equipment/locations to mix up the Q site.  Pull up bars...Not really   Ball Frenzy Pit....Maybe we could us   Weird retaining pond hill....Definitely  Nothing too earth shattering but many small obstacles that could be incorporated to get a good lather going.  Imagination will be the key to unlocking the potential this site has when you look at all angles. (Its large enough)  More to come later in the back blast.

When contemplating the Q at the Tortoises you need to put yourself in the least run favored PAX member to get an idea of the mumble chatter that will pursue.  No one gave any grief today when I started us out on the journey.  There was some talk about the F3 site giving this site a "no run" status icon, although it is really a limited run workout.  I thought Yogi hacked into the system to f\*\*\* with us.

Grinch and Texas Ranger both arrived 2 minutes to spare and we exchanged the usual pleasantries and were off.
