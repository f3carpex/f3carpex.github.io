Nothing like the good ole days, when Yogi comes in hot from an EC run which alone should get one worried. He did not disappoint.

Warmup: SSH

Thang: 10 rounds with Tyson: (Merkins, WWII, Squats, Wide grip merkins, LBC, sumo squats, Diamond merkins, Big Boy situp, Prisoner Squat, Burpees)

As heard during the workout, round 8, "This ain't Curves boys, there is no way you guys got all your prisoner squats in."

As heard in round 10: "Ralph" Yogi spilling merlot during his own workout due to over exertion halfway through round 10.
