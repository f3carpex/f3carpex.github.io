YHC pulled into the parking lot at Apex Community Park bracing for the cold, but as soon as I got out of the car my heart was warmed by the sight of so many of my brothers, smiling and excited to get after it despite the bitter temperature.

**NMS**

Future A-Team Q's the gravel lot is not a good spot for warm-up.  I had to audible out of doing burpees, not the way I wanted to start my year.  So you guys owe me 18 burpees, I'll be collecting them before the end of the year.

The greenway around the lake is beautiful, but it's two miles long, which is too long for a normal 45 minute workout.  Turns out it was a little too long for a 60 minute workout too.  Thanks to the PAX for sticking with us and not complaining about the overtime.

You know we've got something special when 41 men come out on New Year's Day to run around in 17 degree weather.  I don't know about you guys, but I wasn't there for the work out, I was there to spend time with my brothers, the guys who helped make 2017 a great year for me.

Thanks to Parker for the co-Q, I look forward to getting after it with you more in 2018.

Thanks for letting us lead.
