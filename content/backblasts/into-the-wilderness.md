6 PAX gathered at 228 Ambassador Loop for the best AO in Downtown Cary on a Tuesday evening. First exercise, the Pledge of Allegience.

### Jordan Lake Brewing

Mosey down to JLB for warmups. SSHs, Cotton Pickers, Sir Fazio forward and back, Control Freak merkins and Plank Jacks.

Then we want to use the very faded parking lot lines for a quick round of Bear Crawls with ascending Merkins on each line. We get to 6, then find a wall. Another quick round, this of the famed BTTW Indian run. Once we got Traffic Cone squared away on the rules, this was completed. Time for our next stop.

### Parking Deck

7s - Supermans at the bottom, World's Worst Merkins at the top. Once completed, we partner up to play with the parking lot again. Wheelbarrow Merkins ascending up to 5, then flip flop and come back.

### Downtown Proper

What is Rush Hour without a trip to downtown at the corner circle. Mosey on down, YHC and neglected our friend Steve Earle during the warmup so complete 20. Next, since we're in a circle we need to visit our other friend Jack Webb. Complete up to 10/40.

### Back Where We Started

Mosey back to the flag(s). While the 6 arrive we learn what the Break Dance Merkin is x 5. Find a wall height that suits you. Together we complete ascending Wall Jump Burpees up to 5. Properly blasted, we find a parking lot space for PAX choice Mary exercises. Time's up.

### COT

1 Hate, 1 Respect, 4 Mehs. Remember the KKC - February 2nd. Prayer requests for Ausfarht, Swag and his M, Goose & Water Wings children having surgery, Theisman with an exciting job opportunity, Kermit with some pending career decisions, Red Ryder's 2.0 seeking some needed help. YHC took us out.

### NMS

Try Jordan Lake Brewing Company - a bit of a hole in the wall but very good beer. The Amber is my favorite. I also love doing wall jump burpees here, in case you post when I have the Q. And if you don't know what a Break Dance Merkin is, ask Pivot. Make every day a little better than the day before. It was an honor to lead these men.
