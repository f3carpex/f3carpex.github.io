Site Q Sooey had promised 57 degrees this morning, and he was off by about 13 degrees, so 13 vets and 1 FNG had to deal with an Angry Duck

**Warm-Up** Mosey to the Christmas tree in beautiful downtown Apex and circle up for a few warm-up exercises, including Good Mornings from Crimson.

**The Thang** Mosey around the corner to the T-intersection next to the Methodist church and split into three groups. Group 1 does sevens in one direction (merkins and squats), Group 2 does sevens in the other direction (merkins and LBCs), Group 3 does sevens in the other other direction (squats and LBCs). When one group finishes we rotate so everyone gets the full experience. Back to the Christmas tree for monkey humpers in honor of the Das Boot guys who were already long gone.

**Mary** Mosey back to the flag for Mary, including burpees and Have A Nice Day.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  15 **Name-a-rama**:  3 RESPECT, 10 meh, 2 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for the men of Carpex to make 2021 an awesome year, with a reminder that it's up to us to make it happen. **BOM**:  YHC took us out **NMS**  Welcome FNG Frasier! He's a friend of Texas Ranger visiting from Boone. We thought his last name was Crane, like the Cheers character Frasier, but it turns out it's actually Crank. We could've had some fun with that, but it's OK, when the Boone boys ask him how he got his name it's a funnier story this way.

After the third round of sevens YHC called on Braveheart to tell us what you get when you multiply three and seven. I figured he's the youngest of the group and the one most likely to get it right. He said 21, which is correct, I even double checked it when I got home. 21, just like the number of the new year. That's what we Pros call a Pro Move.

Actually I had only planned on two sets of sevens, but the group was so large I had to add a third to keep the pax spread out. It's better to be lucky than good.

A couple of guys with fancy watches said we went over three miles. I'm pretty happy with that kind of start to the year.

Love you guys!
