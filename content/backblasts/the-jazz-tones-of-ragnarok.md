Thorsday's hard launch of AO Ragnarok started off with the mellow tones of a local band. This was an absolute treat, folks, as they were quite good and we could hear them through most of the workout. I attached a short video of their practice to the 1F and MC channels on Slack for those who want to listen in...or you could just post next week and we'll see if they come back! We had a great group of HIMs post last night because they wanted that sweet sweet merch...then Chewy showed up 4 or 5 deep from a frat get-together and I knew we'd have a good night. Here's the workout:

2000 - Welcome, Disclaimer, Pledge

2001 - Warm up mosey around the big pickle

- 20 SSH ic
- L/R Calf stretch
- L/R groin stretch
- 3 Good Evenings

2010 - The Thang!

Mosey to South side of Apex Lake

- At .25, .35, .5, .75 mile marks: various exercises like 50 merkins, 10 burpees, plank holds, lunge walks, prisoner indigenous people runs
- At South Side: sprint up the hill, 10 merkins, mosey down the hill, 10 Sumo Squats

**Repeato x 5**

- Mosey to North side of Apex Lake (it's at this point I decided that Mary would be happening as part of the POAS)
    - At 1.3, 1.5, 1.7, 1.9 mile marks: 50 merkins, 10 JLo’s ic, 20 dead cockroaches ic, Captain Thors, Surtur's 100s, and maybe a few others to hold for the 6 as well as work some Mary in!

- Captain Thors up to 6/24 (a Ragnarok Mary staple)
- Surtur’s 100s (100s but with flutter kicks to really crush your Infinity Stones)
- Mosey back to the Melt Stick for 1 last round of Surtur's 100s with the 6
- Have a Nice Night

2045 - COT

Count-a-rama, Name-a-rama, Announcements, Prayers/Praises

“Everyone fails at who they’re ‘supposed’ to be. The measure of a person, of a hero, is how well they succeed at being who they are.” - Frigga, Thor’s mom

NMS: We had to adjust the workout a little for pace complications on the run, but I feel like all got a great workout in regardless! It was a beautiful night with: live music, @Hanson watching us creepily as we sprint up the hill and do merkins, live animals with glowing eyes, a couple on a bench seemingly mid-romance, and some great 2nd F via mumble chatter as well as with drinks at Brewster's Pub afterwards. Several HIMs earned their Ragnarok gear and I know will wear it with pride.
