**AO:** Phoenix  
**Workout Date:** 06/12/21  
YHC has posted Phoenix (or maybe it was Werewolf), but it has obviously been a while. The starting parking lot was a lot smaller than I remembered and there were a large number of PAX, including three FNGs. Time to start modifying the plan.

**Warm Up:**  
State the mission, check for FNGs (3), and give the disclaimer  
Side Straddle Hop x20 In Cadence (IC)  
Good Morning x5 IC  
Imperial Walker x20 IC  
Sir Fazio Arm Circles forward x10 IC, reverse x10 IC

**Main Event**  
**1)** Start right in the parking lot with **Number of the Beast**: 6 stations, 6 rounds, 6 exercises, 6 reps per station. Sumo Squats, American Hammers, Merkins, Jump Squats, Little Baby Crunches, and Burpees.  
**2)** Mosey to the field for **Jacob's Ladder** (Star Jumps)  
**3)** **Bear Crawl/Lunge Walk 7s** in the field (Wide Grip Merkins, Carolina Dry Docks). Tecumseh stepped in with a couple of exercises to keep the PAX working while the six finished the 7s  
**4)** Mosey back to start, pausing at the street for **Side Straddle Hops x20 IC** while waiting for the six  
**5)** Mosey back to start and partner up for **half Dora** (50 Merkins, 100 LBCs, 150 Squats). Shorter run loop option suggested for those who needed it.

**Naked Moleskin:**  
Lots of good Carpex mumble chatter. Everything from Ozzy Osbourne ability to only enunciate curse words to Tinder profiles tips.  
Big Red has crazy math skills and a "friendly" relationship with Tecumseh.  
It was great to see Tecumseh again. It's been a couple of years.  
Welcome to our FNGs; Big Red thinks this might be a site record.  
This was my sixtieth #F3Q21 #2021Challenge Q (sixty-second overall). Next Q is Monday at Wolverine in Carpex.
