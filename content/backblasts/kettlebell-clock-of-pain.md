Well, appears something going on with the fields and the regular spot that we normally meet because the gate in is locked.  We decide to head to the nature park up the street because for some reason that gate is open.  Gather the HIM and head over, parking in the very back near the shelter.  Hop out and see this great circle that just shouts for some sort of pain.  First-up though, we need to mosey to the front of the parking area for:

## Warm Up

Good mornings

Windmills

Imperial Walkers

Sir Fazio Arm Thingies

Overhead Claps

 

## The Thang

Done with our warm-up, we head back to circle for a modified clock-work exercise.  With the kettlebells, you move around the clock with your personal bell, performing called exercise all the way around.  Time on the clock:

1:00  Curls for Girls

2:00  Over-head presses

3:00  Nutcrackers

4:00  Tri-cep Extensions

5:00  Goblet Squats

6:00  Figure Eights  (friendship run around the parking lot)

7:00  Kettlebell swings

8:00  Squats

YHC checks the time with Disco and we are running close on time, so needed to audible, instructing the PAX to perform one-arm snatches from 9:00 to top of the hour, bringing the bell to the circle for:

## Mary

 

WW2 sit-ups on the up

Freddie Mercuries in cadence

Flutter Kicks

Dying cockroach

American Hammers

Bell tolls 6:15 and time to finish.

## COT

**Count-a-rama:**  10 PAX

**Announcements:**

- Habitat for Humanity April 12th and 13th

 

It was an honor to lead you men this morning.
