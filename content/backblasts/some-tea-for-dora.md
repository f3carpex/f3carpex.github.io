Over 70 Pax showed up for the Odyssey only two days ago, and after six AO's and 11.5 miles of total distance covered....rest assured there would be some sore pax by this morning.  Would it be possible to hit a muscle group that wouldn't be sore already?  Let's see.....

Wait, what tha hell is this hard clear stuff on my windshield?!?!?!  Frost?!  Weather channel said 36 degrees!!!!  After the truck warmed up enough to get that melted, I headed to the AO for a little EC Odyssey recovery run with Ollie.  3.25 miles, slow and easy...now I'm warmed up and ready!

17 Total showed up (Banjo was **NOT** there) at the gloomiest AO in Carpex this brisk fall morning, and since YHC managed to leave not one but TWO flags at the church after the Odyssey, we borrowed the Gran Torino flag (Thanks, Biner!)  

1st Exercise, the Pledge of allegiance!  Then follow me out to the walking track to the far parking lot for some **warm-a-rama:**

- 30 SSH
- 15 Imperial Walkers
- 10 Good Mornings
- Calf Stretch
- 10 Merkins OYO
- Run back to the playground

**The Thang!**

- 5 Pullups OYO - Yeah, we didn't really hit our back muscle group during the Odyssey, so let's get some today!
    - At this point YHC PROVED that Bears do, in fact, at least pee in the woods
    - Ollie led the Pax through a 10 Merkin holding pattern
- Mosey to the shelter for a demo
    - 5ea Triple-Tea-Bag-Jumps
        - Kinda how it sounds....find a bench and squat to tea bag position just touching the seat, LIGHTLY bounce three times then jump bag to standing position
        - _Oh, and YHC picked this exercise up during the Raleigh Triple Down a few weeks ago, though the FIA crowd did not have a creative name for it....so I made this one up._
- 10 Dips
- Run the pickle once
- The pax has now gone through a deconstructed Dora...time to put it together, so pick a partner

**DORA:**

- 100 Pullups
- 200 Triple-Tea-Bag-Jumps
- 300 Dips
- Partner Runs the Pickle and switch off
- Upon completion, extra Pull-ups and Dips, then plank hold for the 6

**The Follow-Up (Not really a full "Thang:"**

- Head back to the walking path and stop at the first corner
- 40 Standard Merkins OMD
    - The pax thought I'd stop at 20, then FOR SURE stop at 30.....nope
- Run to the next corner
- 40 American Hammers
- Run to the next corner / far parking lot
- 10 Wolverines OMD
- Run to the flag
- 5 Worst Merkins Ever OYO

**Prayers/3rd F:**

- Geek Squad spent some time recently volunteering down in New Bern assisting in low-income housing areas that were badly hit by the storm.  He described one home hit particularly hard by flood waters such that NOTHING in the home was salvageable, including the house itself.  This house is occupied by a 90yo WWII Vet.  Geek Squad concluded by asking that we each find a way to help those in need, either around us or in areas impacted heavily by these storms.

**Praises:**

None

 

YHC took us out with a moment of silence and quick prayer reminding us all that while we are able-bodied, others are not and it is upon us, the able-bodied, to step up and support those unable to do so themselves.  It is our responsibility as leaders to take that initiative in small ways every day.

 

6 for Coffeetoria at Crema.  Banjo was there.
