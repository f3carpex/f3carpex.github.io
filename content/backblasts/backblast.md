Is it gonna rain, or isn't it.  Last night Steve said it was likely to rain.  This morning, he's saying it won't.

17, er, 18 HIMs braved the uncertainty that is the iPhone weather app and posted on a near-perfect 50 degree November morning.

First exercise, the Pledge of Allegiance

**Warm Up**

Pet Sounds arrives.

Slow count Good Mornings, Sir Fazio arm circles, overhead claps, Steve Earles, Cotton Pickers, and Merkins (on my down AND up).

Run the Pickle

**Pre Thang**

Circle up with your kettle bell of choice for deconstructed Burpee 11s.

**The Thang**

Kettle Bell Dora 1-2-3:

- Partner 1 completes 100 Rock Yer Body, 200 KB swings, and 300 KB curls
- Partner 2 moseys down to the pull up bars, completes 5 pullups
- Flip flop until complete
- Those who are finished do KB overhead press AMRAP
- Fellowship cool down run around the pickle

**Mary**

According to Earhart we "never do Mary", so today we're gonna.  PAX choice of various Mary exercises, including a 6 count thing that Parker did.  Almost fell apart there.  YHC calls Squatter 100s, then finish up with 10 burpees OYO.

**COT**

- 4 Respects, 1 Hate, 13 Mehs
- Announcements - Toy Drive (bring toys to each AO), Christmas Party 12/13, JOCO clown car on 12/1, KK Challenge, Night To Shine (Hope CC) needs volunteers
- Prayers: YHC traveling the next 9 days, everyone around us in need during the holiday season
- YHC took us out

**NMS**

- Water Wings was on his best behavior after my Tarheels fell to his Wolfpack over the weekend. Had he misbehaved, YHC would simply point out that only 29 more consecutive wins and the Wolfpack would pull the all-time series to .500.  But, since he didn't say anything, neither will YHC.
- Couldn't we all make ends meet with a $12 million buyout?
- No bonus burpees were called when Pet Sounds was 30 seconds late.  Public shaming was enough.
- Musical selection was "Workout - Classic Rock" by Jasonroelofs on Spotify.
- The reference to Steve is Steve Jobs - Dredd actually has a chart to tell him how he should dress for workouts based on the iphone weather app.
- Be a little better today than you were yesterday.
