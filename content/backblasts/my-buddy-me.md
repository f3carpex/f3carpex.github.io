On Tuesday, YHC examined the Q-sheet for Bounty Hunter and noticed no one had signed up to lead the beatdown this week. I hadn't Q'd in a while, other than the Sharknado co-Q with Rooney, so I decided to pick it up. 16 pax showed up. I Pity the Fool was already drenched from an EC run. Orphan ran in from Shepherd's Vineyard and Bad Company and Scorpion King ran up Hunter Street. Michelob ran in from somewhere very very far away probably. The disclaimer was offered and we pledged allegiance to the flag.

Warm Up

Jog to parking lot by baseball field. We made a stop to check to see if those pristine soccer fields were open. They weren't. Heaven forbid someone go out there and play on a field. Thanks Apex.

20x SSH

10x Good AMs

The Thang #1

Today was all about partner work. Find a buddy and stick with him like a familiar late 80's toy pictured above. Partner up for Catch Me If You Can around the big loop. Lap 1 = Merkins x 10. Lap2 = Star Jumps x 10. Lap 3 = WW2s x 5. Plank hold for the 6 after each lap. 

The Thang #2

Line up across the parking lot from your partner. 

Round 1 = Bear crawl to your partner for 5 partner clap merkins then crawl bear back. Repeato with 10 and 15 partner clap merkins. 

Round 2 = Lunge walk to your partner for 10 jump squats then walk lunge back. Repeato with 15 jump squats. 

Round 3 = crab walk to your partner for 10 WW2s then walk crab back. Repeato with 15 WW2s. 

The Thang #3

Partner 1 sprints the parking lot while partner 2 does American Hammer AMRAP. Flapjack. Repeato 2 more times. 

Mosey back to skate park.
