It was a glorious morning at FWD.  Build-a-Bear set out for a solo EC 4 miler at 4:50 while Chipper, Lite Brite & Yoga Mat set out for a nice fellowship 2 miler at 5:05.  All were back to the flag at 5:30 to be joined by 8 other PAX and the 12 of us begin the search for light.   Olsen was also there today but I can't seem to find him on Slack.
