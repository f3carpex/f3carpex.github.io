I have to admin it was quite chilly this morning but 12 PAX braved the colder temperatures to celebrate the 1 year anniversary of the finest site in NW Cary on Thursday. I am sure the PAX would have preferred Clementine's Q but since he had an unfortunate accident last weekend on the Odyssey YHC took over the lead spot. Get better soon buddy!

We all arrived early so it was tempting to take off before 5:45 but I thought Trike might come in on two wheels but he never showed up so off we went.

Mosey to parking lot between the schools for:

Warm up:

- 15 x SSH
- 5 x Good Mornings
- 8 x Windmills (was planning 10 but got bored)
- 10 x Merkins OMD
- 10 x Mountain Climbers
- 10 x Imperial Walkers

Mosey over to the smaller walking track for:

Thang 1:

The 'mini' cooper.

- 10 Burpees
- 10 Squats
- 10 Merkins
- Take a lap
- 9, 9, 9
- Take a lap
- you get the idea...

It was a mini-cooper since YHC skipped the big track and opted for the walking track in stead.

Run back to basketball court. Quick pause to partner up. Run in together with partner. Partners are good at pushing us harder!

Thang 2:

- Keeping your same partner from the run
- Partner 1 - Suicide run drill
- Partner 2 - BTTW
- Repeat but with People's Chair

Thang 3:

- Move to parking lot
- Partner 1: Mary Exercise of your choice
- Partner 2: Bear crawl to other parking lot island.
- Repeat

Mary:

- American Hammers
- Freddie Mercuries (Thanks Hotty Toddy)
- Box cutters (Thanks Sky Blue)
- Merkins (of course Ma Bell)
- Have a nice day

COT:

- YHC asked for prayers and wisdom about making choice to fix back issue
- YHC took us out

NMS:

- FC is THE premier site in NW Cary on Thursdays
- The site Qs are awesome - Bacon AND Coffee. Coffee was better than Starbucks. If you know me you know that is a huge compliment!
- It was chilly but its really easier than the humidity!
- Nice work boys!
