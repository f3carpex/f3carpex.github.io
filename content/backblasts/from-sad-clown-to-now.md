So 2 years ago on this date, worked out at Rush Hour I followed that up with posting at BO and SWW, so I almost did the same to Celebrate, and adding Q'ing to finish out the week.

**FNGs:** None

**Warm Up:** 15 SSH, 15 Imperial Walkers, 15 Hillbillys, 10 Sir Fazio forward and backward, 10 Good Mornings ( the south wake way)  
**The Workout:** Mosey’d the Base ballfield

Prayer: Term Paper  
**TClaps:** Hermes for taking 6 men to keep our social distancing the backblast here for what they did  
**NMS:** Men it has been an honor to be a part of F3 for the last 2 years, I am appreciative of everything I get from workouts and know that I have a group of men behind me If I need it. It is more than a workout, it feels like being part of teams like I was in high school but without ego's getting in the way of greatness.
