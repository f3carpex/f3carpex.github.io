**AO:** Disturbing The Peace  
**Workout Date:** 06/29/21  
After checking out backblasts and Google Maps, YHC posted for the prerun to get a final feel for the AO. We got in a surprising (to me) three miles.

**Warm Up:**  
State the mission, check for FNGs (1), and give the disclaimer  
Pledge of Allegiance  
Side Straddle Hop x20 In Cadence (IC)  
Good Morning x5 IC  
Imperial Walker x10 IC  
Sir Fazio Arm Circles forward x5 IC, reverse x5 IC

**Main Event**  
**1)** Mosey up to Apex Town Campus for **Sevens**. Squats and Star Jumps.  
**2)** Ask the PAX which is the quickest route to the Methodist Church and follow them there. Partner up and grab a rock per pair for **AMRAP (As Many Reps As Possible) rock work**. One partner does a rock exercise while the other partner runs out and back. Flapjack. Repeato with different exercises. Exercises were: Curl, Overhead Press, Triceps Extension, Bent Over Row, Shoulder Tap, Family Feud (rock taps while in plank), and others I can’t remember. PAX called their own audible and ran a larger loop than I intended, but we made it work. Return rocks and head back to start for quick Mary.  
**3)** PAX introduce me to All Your Got Alley on the way back to start. **All You Got** down the Alley!

Welcome FNG Bumper Sticker, Decal's brother!  
  
Announcements:  
Carpex July 4 convergence is July 3 at Bond Park (Phoenix AO) for 1776 workout

Prayers for friend's good health news, other prayers that I have forgotten. Prayers unspoken.  
I don't remember who took us out.

**Naked Moleskin:**  
Don't prerun with a guy named Track Star. (actually the push was good, didn't think I'd hit three miles)  
T-claps to everyone for the warm welcome and the friendly assists on getting us around town.  
This was my sixty-eighth #F3Q21 #2021Challenge Q (seventieth overall). Next Q is Thursday at Back In Black.
