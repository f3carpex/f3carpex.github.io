Seeing a rare Q-spot opening for Rush Hour, YHC grabbed this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and immediately started preparing for little something different for the good folks of DTC.

Of course, with only a handful of Rush Hour experiences under my belt, "something different" might not have been all that different but I was going to try!

But first... Tiberius needs a ride. I'm in. A text message (3:31PM), a Slack message (4:06PM) and a phone call (4:12PM) later I'm really confirmed.

We roll into DTC 5:15 and park the ol' Jeepster at Jordan Lake before taking an exploratory jaunt to the NE. Heading back to the starting area, YHC has a good idea of what today's hot & humid fun will entail.

#### Warmup

Let's get out of the sun and into the shade by the parking deck for:

- 15 SSH, 15 Good Afternoons, 15 Windmills, 10 burpees (@DiscoDuck) and 20 Sir Fazios (small & big; forward & reverse)

#### Thang

Pick up 2 pain sticks to share and mozey.

We cross over East Dur'm Rd and find a fine field twix Durm and Chapel Hill for:

- PAX1: Pain Stick your Body x10 while PAX2: 'Mericans... flip/flop
- PAX1: Pain Stick your Body x10 while PAX2: Freddy Merc's

Leaving our pain sticks behind (and all hoping that some passing NC Stater grabs them) we head up Field Street to see what we can see. A nice big square-ish field with a big ol' water tower in the middle. Sweet!

Four Corner Pierogi-Escalator Style.

Corner 1: 10x squats Corner 2: 10x IC Freddy Mercury + 20x squats Corner 3: 10x 'Mericans + 20x IC Freddy Mercury + 30x squats Corner 4: 10x StarJumps + 20x 'Mericans + 30x IC Freddy Mercury + 40x squats

Round 2:

Corner 1: 10x Lunges (L/R = 2) Corner 2: 10x IC Plank Jacks + 20x Lunges (L/R = 2) Corner 3: 10x 'Mericans + 20x IC Plank Jacks + 30x Lunges (L/R = 2) Corner 4: 10x Burpees + 20x 'Mericans + 30x IC Plank Jacks + 40x Lunges (L/R = 2)

Mosey back to the sticks... still there. Darn.

Mosey back to DTC, drop off said sticks.

#### Mary

Not today. At least not that I remember. It was getting late and the PAX were thirsty. Don't want any dehydration issues today!

#### HH

Head over to Jordan Lake for beverages and COT

#### COT

Count-a-rama: 4 PAX + 1 for HH (Bogo)

Name-O-Rama: Name + Age + F3Name + Raise a Glass!

Announcements: YHC is picking up clothes and shoes for the Glorious Ladies of FiA; 9/11 and FMJ Convergence; no one knows if Labor Day will be a special day or not

Prayers/Praises: Disco Duck's M; Kirk's mom

YHC took us out.

#### NMS

Missed you Disco. But the HH after RH seemed a hit. It's also only 0.2 miles from the flags to the counter @ Jordan Lake.

I love Bond Brothers as much as the next guy. But Jordan Lake has definitely got it going on as well. Definitely a different crowd. Tuesday is darts night so there was a small crew throwing. A pool table and high tables for 7 Wonders were also in use. Suggest the PAX checkthis place out. YHC recommends the Nova Anglia but I think everyone had good things to say about their beverages.

Today was short mileage wise but YHC was drenched. Good thing Old Maid was parallel to me during the Star Jumps. It was like a sprinkler up in there.
