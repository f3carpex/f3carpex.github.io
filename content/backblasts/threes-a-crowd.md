Three pax made it out to downtown Cary for another evening beatdown at Rush Hour, and after a little time of fellowship we were ready to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. One of the regulars from the Bond Brother’s run club was passing by at the same time, and he stopped and did the Pledge along with us! So that was really cool! When we finished we ran around to back side of the town hall for warm ups.

Run to the bottom level of the parking deck. Working with the lines on each parking space: **Bear Crawl** 3 lines forward, **Crawl Bear** 1 line back. Continue this routine all the way to the other end of the deck.

Using the rest of the levels of the deck we did **B.L.I.M.P.S.** to get to the top, and after we recovered from that with **Calf Raises** and **People’s Chair** we headed back to the grassy pocket area.

On the first round of wall exercises we did **Dips,** and **Crab Walks**. Second round was **Alternating Left Right Step ups**, and **Lunge Walks**.
