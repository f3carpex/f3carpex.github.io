Realizing that 2021 was coming to an end pretty quickly and knowing that my anniversary of joining F3 was in January, I grabbed the Q slot back in late Oct to celebrate it as best I can. Little did I know how important this Q would be...

A quick disclaimer was made and with no fngs in attendnace, we started with the pledge. Then we mozied towards the parking lot up the road.. stopping 1x to gather pax (leave no man behind) and for some good mornings

At the parking lot we did warmups consisting of:

- SSH
- Sir faziosa
- Seal claps
- Overhead claps.
- Calf stretches 
- Runners stretch 

**Thang 1 - using stairs  — 7s**

- Burpees
- Squat jumps

**Mozy to lower portion of lot for Thang 2**

- Lunge 2 lines. Bear crawl 2 lines
- Mozy back to start. 
- Crab walk 2 lines. Walk crab 2 lines

**Mozy on greenway back to flag....stopping for 10 counts - to pick up six.**

**Thang 3:**

- Railing — dips / irking

**Mozy to bb - court for Mary** 

- Homer to marge
- Low slow flutter 
- LBC
- Yoga poses
- Boat canoe 
- American hammers 

**Have a nice day**

YHC thanks all for for coming out for my 3rd year.  As I asked for prayers and praises, the mood was a solemn one... and I took the moment to reflect on the loss of F3: Higgins (Wilson Raj), who took his life two days prior.  
  
Higgins appeared to have what looked like a great life. Good job. Married with 2 kids.. and yet had something else below the surface that we didn't see or know about.  
  
I shared -- albeit briefly -- how I too have had some darker thoughts during some of my most recent solo training runs... and being the emotional creature that I am, I shifted the story to how I found F3.... giving props to Burt, Swag and Michelob.....  
  
Schroeder immediately asked when my next run was and said he would be there with me.  
  
So -- with that said.. YHC took us out in prayer.  
A moment of silence.  
Continued prayers for Wilson Raj (F3: Higgins) and his family.  
  
Lastly, I wish and want nothing but the best for all the HIM of F3 Carpex/Nation.. and though it may be tough to ask for help... at a bare minimum, know that we are all in this together. If you don't feel comfortable talking with someone in F3.. call
