Well, another Tuesday night has come and gone just that fast. Which meant the finest and only evening AO in Carpex took place. This week, though only 5 pax posted, YHC was thrilled to have a variety of guys who showed up for the beatdown, as far as their their presence at Rush Hour is concerned. We had two familiar faces with Press On and his (fur) 2.0, Briefs. We had a first time RH post from Entitlement, and we also saw the return of the one and only Disco Duck! So it was going to be a great evening! Once the two minute warning was up, a disclaimer was given, the pledge was recited, and we were off and running to the opposite side of the main building for warm ups.
