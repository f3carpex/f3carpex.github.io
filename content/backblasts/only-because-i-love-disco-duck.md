Writing backblasts are the worst.  Mainly because WordPress blows worse than a HLQ.  But because I love Disco Duck, and because we did things:

Bear crawl 7s (CDD, merkins), Gorilla walk 7s (superman pulses, LBCs), Rock 7s (curls, squats), Rockin with your friends (curls, presses, extensions, rows, rockees, repeatish repeatish), Round Robin Mary (to help ppl learn how to Q).  Limited running.  YHC out.
