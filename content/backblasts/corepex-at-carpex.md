December 28, 2021: The Claymore AO keeps getting smaller there's lots of construction on site. I had planned to run up the hill and maybe use rocks, but we didn't get there. I'm glad I showed up 15 minutes early to scout & set up.

No FNGs, no disclaimer, we went right into it.

Mozy to fence & back, then

**_NMS:_**  
It was a pleasure to lead these PAX on the end of another trip around the sun for me. Being an Honor last year was something. Honor +1 is just another notch. I'm just trying to keep this motor running.  
I am thankful for F3 Carpex for helping me to accelerate and for brothers that keep me accountable.
