YHC was excited to serve up a post Super Bowl beatdown this morning at Hells Bells. Although I have not Q’d this workout in a while (actually I haven’t put my name on the Q sheet much at all over the past few years, but that will change for 2020) I was looking forward to giving the PAX something to do on this fine Monday morning.

Pledge at the flag. No FNG’s and off we go…..quick mosey around the pickle back up to the front parking lot, circle up…

Warm up – GM, Sir Fazzios, Merkins, Imperial Walkers

Thang 1: Standard Dora. Partner up. one partner runs to the pull up bar and does 5 pull ups while partner 2 works on 100 Thrusters with the bell, 200 Merkins, 300 Squats. Flip flop (you know how a dora works)

Thang 2: Mosey to top of the parking lot with your partner. Partner 1 lunge walks half of parking lot and moseys back. Partner 2 AMRAP curls for girls and tri extensions with the bell. When your partner comes back do 5 burpees together and flip flop. After 2 rounds change lunge walks for bear crawls for another 2 rounds

Thang 3 – Circle of Pain. Everyone gets a bell, circle up and gets into the plank position with one hand on your bell. Each Pax does one merkin going around the circle – if you are not doing a merkin hold plank position. Once around, then 2 merkins – up to 5 merkins (you get it)

MARY – American Hammers and LBC’s with your bells. Thank you Earhart and Term Paper

Count-a-rama  - 17 Pax.

Announcements – Red Ryder – Wet Stone mentorship program……Some other stuff too but YHC had to get my phone for name-a-rama

Prayer/Praises – Ausfart back out in the gloom, Yahoo and the continued adaption process.  And I apologize, I think there was another 1 or 2 but cannot remember them. 

THC took us out.
