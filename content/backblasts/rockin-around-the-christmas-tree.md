9 rocked around (a very small) Christmas tree while 4 rucked around them.

**Warm up**

After a short mosey round the pickle, the PAX gathered for side-straddle hops (15), daisy pickers (15), hamstring stretches, plank hops (15) and calf stretches, then proceeded to the "play area" for...

**Thang 1** - Tempo fugiemus?

Tempo-based series in 1:3 ratio featuring dips (15), bear crawl to raised heel half squats (15), crab crawl to curbkins (15), turkey trot (duck waddle). Then, proving history never quite repeats itself, the same set in reverse with 3:1 ratio: trot turkey to curbkins (15), crawl crab to rhhs (15), crawl bear to dips (15). Mosey to the rock pile for...

**Thang 2** - Tempo non fugimus!

PAX selected two rocks apiece - one big one for rows & floor bench, one smaller one for bicep curls, shoulder press and tricep extensions. Tempo-based series of 15ea in 1:3 ratio followed by a short pickle jog to warm up the hands. Then, proving history never exactly repeats itself, the same set in reverse in 3:1 ratio.

Kudos and thanks to EarharT for keeping us honest and safe with our movements.

**Thang 3** - Tempus fugit.

A quick sevens featuring star jumps at the bottom of the small car park incline, with burpees at the top. A jolly time was had by all!

**Mary-o-rama**

Ninjago led us off with American hammers (15), followed by American hammers (15) courtesy of Frisco, followed by Half pike's American hammers (15), after which Sputnik sensibly introduced some Superman raises (15), leading on to WWW's groiners (15), Pickles' Freddie Mercuries (a bunch), wrapping up with EarharT's WW2s. The ruckers joined in for groiners on.

Countarama: 13 getting out in the gloom for fun, fellowship and frozen hands.

Announcements: Christmas party - Dec 12, Fortnight. Signup is now live - check out F3carpex.com for the link.

Praises and prayers: Frisco shared praise for Crimson for helping him shake off doubt and inertia and get out of a posting lull. Let us all take a look around for any HIMs that need a gentle nudge or helping hand to achieve the same. Frisco took us out.

Thanks everyone for posting today. I'll be doing my best to keep active over the next few weeks with the baby shark abs workout.
