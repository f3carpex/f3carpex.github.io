Part 2 of 6 Celebrating with 14 of Carpex's finest Here's what we did.

Warm Up: Disclaimer given. Pledge said. Side Straddle Hops, Good Mornings, Windmills, Imperial Walkers. Monkey Humper's per Term Papers request. I thought it was odd too. lol. I also moved my butt to the center of the circle. I'm missing 3 pax so feel free to shout them out in the comments!

The Thang: Circuit Work 5 exercises for 5 reps done for 15 minutes. 1 armed M'ericans 5x per each arms on the balls..., Dips, Box Jumps, Pull Ups, Apollo Ono's. Next grab a partner and grab a rock. Each partner does up to 100 reps of each called exercise while the other runs the Gherkin while weaving the balls..... 1st pax to reach 100 reps is when we switch exercises. Curls, Triceps Extension and Bent over rows were performed. Mosey over to the parking lot entrance and bear crawl to the flag. No one called a Billy Run. I could sense disappointment.

Mary: LBC's Reverse LBC's, WW2's, Freddie Mercury, & Light Stretching, will the stretching at Mary catch on?

COT: Announcements, Prayers & Praises Spoken. YHC lead us in Prayer.

NMS: whatever this yoast seo thing is that keeps me from seeing the rest of what I'm typing needs to go.
