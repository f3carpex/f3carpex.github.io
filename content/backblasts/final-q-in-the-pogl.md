15 PAX gathered in the POGL for YHC's final Q in Apex. Two still to go next week in Cary before I ship up to Raleigh. This was also YHC's second time ever Qing a limited run workout. After a painful outing at Rush Hour last night, I knew this was going to be a challenge!  
  
No FNGs. Disclaimer. Pledge.

## Warm Up

Walk over to the parking lot immediately adjacent to the flag and circle up for the following exercises:  
100 SSH IC  
20 Hillbillies IC  
10 Good Mornings IC  
10 Tappy Taps IC

## Thang One

Walk over to the grassy area by the pull up bars. PAX were instructed to perform in no particular order or pattern:  
100 Pull Ups  
200 Squats  
300 LBCs

## Thang Two

Slow mosey to the side of the church with the big wall. Count off by 2s. 1s did BTTW while 2s did 100s. Flapjack, Repeato X2. 
1s then did People's Chair.

## Thang Three

Full speed mosey to bottom of "Tool Hill" (as I learned it was called). 1s crawl bear'd up the hill while 2s did Turkish Getups. Flapjack, Repeato. The next time 2s did star jumps instead.

## Mary

Mosey back to the flag. PAX were then instructed to do 1 set of Crowd Pleasers to 5. For an explanation of this please see the BB from Rush Hour yesterday.  
  
Crunch Frogs ICx10  
Then about 7-8 other PAX called out 10 count Mary exercises.

## COT

No announcements.  
Wahoo took us out.

## NMS

Note to self: Qing 3 days in a row right after running the Tuna Relay is probably not one of my better ideas.  
A lot of good PAX post at this AO and Hell's Bells. They will be sorely missed by YHC!
