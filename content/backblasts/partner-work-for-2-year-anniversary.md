12 PAX helped celebrate my 2 year anniversary with F3. There were 3 Honors and 2 Respects. Some chatter as to if SWW will become the older AO of Friday mornings. We saw the end of the lunar eclipse during warm up, disappointed that I didn't make an effort to see it earlier. Today I focused on partner and group work because that is one of the things I enjoy about F3, men working together to get better. I am encouraged and motivated by others. A brief reflection on my 2 years; I have found that “modify as necessary” is essential to success. Listen to your body. There is someone in F3 that can do it, has it, or knows where to find it. My participation has made me a better person; at home, at school, in the community. I have strengthened my relationships with my wife, daughters, family, and friends. I wake up at 4:50 and am ready to go (helps being in bed by 9:00). I still have much to learn and to grow, emotionally, spiritually, and physically.
