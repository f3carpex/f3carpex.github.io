Sick and tired of being made fun of by Flip Flop, a few runners took a break from The Maynard to work on some other muscles. However, runner or not, today's workout pushed everyone a little out of their comfort zone

**Warm-Up  
**Circle up for some Good Mornings, Windmills, Steve Earles, Arm Circles

**Thang One  
**With everyone standing in a circle I called out exercises to be completed for 1 minute OYO (w/30-second recovery), except for those standing in front of the fun toys I brought. They did 1 minute of the following:

Agility Ladder – Quick Feet back and forth  
30lb sandbag Clean & Jerk & Throw  
Ab Roller  
Box Jump  
Kettle Bell  
Battle Rope  
Dumbell Curl & Press  
Kettlebell

The rest of the PAX did: LBC, Merkins, SSH, Imperial Walker, Scorpion, Plank Jack, Hillbillies, Mountain Climber, Squats, Lunges, Star Jumps, Wide Merkins, Diamond Merkins, Big Boy Sit-ups, CDD, Freddie Mercury.  After each exercise we rotated clock-wise.

After we completed 1 full round, we stretched our legs with a short run and then completed 4 more exercises until we ran out of time.

**Mary**  
Low Slow Flutter, Homer To Marge, 100s

**COT**  
Prayers for Callahan, Riptide, Bubba's son & Three Finger Salute's family

YHC took us out with a quote from Mahatma Ghandi
