A few weeks ago Disco Duck mentioned that Qs written out always seem worse than they really are. I had this one on the Q sheet with no real plans, so after reading that I knew I had to step it up.

Early in the morning, 5 Pax meet in the parking lot for some running. Gump goes off and absolutely crushes the Maynard, but we all knew he would. The 4 others, Ollie, Blowout, HGTV, and YHC do an out and back down High House, just a splash under 4 miles.

630, go time. No FNGs, so we pledge and mosey to the community center parking lot. Warm ups consist of GMs, tricep stretches, and runners stretch.

THANG 1: burpees mixed with Jack Webb's, ladder up to 5, 1 Burpee with 1 jack Webb, 2 with 2 each, etc. A little confusion but we got the gist of some of it.

Then burpees mixed with squats up to 10, same count. 1 Burpee with 1 squat, 2 burpees with 2 squats each, up to 10.

Then Burpees with Peter Parker's in the middle, later known as Wolverines, ladder up to 5.

Thang 2: rock work. Grab a non traveling rock and do 5 Lion Kings, run a lap, 10 rock your bodies, run a lap, and 15 rock rows and run a lap. Come back and do 10, no 5 steering wheels (rocks bigger than our muscles).

Still have a little bit of time, these non traveling rocks are now traveling rocks. Mosey towards the front of the community center, 10 squats with the rock. Overhead carry further and then walking lunges to the fence. Then an AYG back to the rock pile.

So, if you're keeping up with our idiotic numbering system, and I really hope you are, that is 85 burpees called, 65 squats called, and between the jack webbs, wolverines and all I don't know how many Merkins called.

Mosey to the line. YHC says F3 is a brotherhood, not just who is here at Phoenix, but across Carpex and the Nation. Naperville has lost one of their HIMs, so an AYG to the flag, for Noonan.

Mary: Pax called, including American Hammers, LBCs, Dying Cockroaches, Low slow flutters, HiLiter was here, so Side Plank Star Crunch, Scuba Booty's, Hello Dollys. HiLiter also led us in some stretches , which were amazing and much needed.

COT: Announcements: Raleigh's Mule 3/14. Burgaw needs people.

Prayers/Praises: Cataracts recovery. Shippers employee lost in a car accident. Texas Ranger took us out.

NMS: I couldn't think of a better way to spend a morning than in the Gloom. Thank you for letting me lead, and for leading as called.
