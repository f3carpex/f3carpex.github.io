It was a beautiful evening in downtown Cary, alas YHC was the only one who showed up to enjoy it.  Can a lonely duck push himself through a workout without his brothers to encourage and inspire him?  Let's find out.

**Warm-Up**

Burpees

**The Thang**

Running, merkins, squats, BTTW, star jumps, LBCs and burpees

**Mary**

Burpees

**COT**

**Count-a-rama**:  1 **Name-a-rama**:  0 RESPECTs, 1 meh, 0 HATEs **Prayers / Praises**:  Continued prayers for YHC's M

**BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**

The best thing about a one man workout is I can ignore side straddle hops and plank jacks in warmups, or low-slow flutters and box cutters in Mary.  Nothing but burpees.  Like when the M is out of town and I have steak for dinner, don't even bother with those side dishes.

The worst thing about a one man workout is the lack of fellowship.  It's just not as fun out there without my boys.
