After a quick disclaimer to the FNG, 15 Pax departed FUMC at promptly 5:45:01. Three ruckers went on their way. Jogged up to the bank plaza (where the new spotlights can burn through your soul) for a typical warmup (SSH, IWs, etc.), losing Callahan in the process.

Jog to the south corner of Academy and Ambassador Loop to partner up. Ascending Burpee Catch-me-if-you-can around the loop to the parking garage.  Riptide offered the opportunity to use the sleds, but YHC eased the minds of the concerned Pax by politely declining.

The Thang

Starting at the top of the Parking Garage. Partner 1 performed an exercise AMRAP while Partner 2 ran down the stairs to the lowest level, ran across the parking deck to the other stairwell, back up to the top and across the deck to the starting point (Flap Jack).

1. Merkins, 2. LBCs, 3. Squats

At this point, YHC checked his watch (shocker) and modified the last one a little. Partner 1 performed Balls to the Wall while Partner 2 ran to the other end of the parking lot, performed 10 Burpees, and ran back (Flap Jack).

Ran back down to Town Hall and Downtown Cary’s forgotten fountain. Partner 1 Bear Crawl around the fountain, while Partner 2 performed Dips (Flap Jack).

Ran back to the church (with a stop ½ way for 10 Burpees OYO). Billy Run to the flag.

Circle in the parking lot (not the street, as to avoid the inevitable school bus – YHC is always thinking) for a little Mary.

Ended promptly at 6:29:59 (Ruckers showed up, with a prodigal Callahan, 4 minutes late).

Not sure what the Ruckers did, but maybe Bartman can share.

While the mumblechatter was lower than normal today, there was an inordinate focus throughout today’s workout on the preparing and marketing of a line of pelts. I think Joe Smith even formed an LLC in the process. You’ll want to get your orders into Riptide to ensure Christmas delivery. Look for a new ad coming to Slack (better yet, avert your eyes).

Welcome to FNG Adjacent and great having Overworked join us in downtown Cary.
