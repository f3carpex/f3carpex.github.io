Thanks to the 32 PAX who showed up for my VQ today. I think overall it well.

Started with Intro/ Disclaimer... no FNG's

Pledge

Follow me down to the Thales School parking lot for warm ups

## Warm-ups

- Good Mornings
- Imperial Walkers
- Side Straddle Hops
- Merkins

## Thang One

- 2 lines and Indian Run from Thales over to the Town Hall Diamond
- We did a Plank Hold while we waited on the 6
- While still waiting on the 6 we did a squat hold. Shut-In called me out on a "Squatty Potty" position which I liked and think we will do them a again. Basically a really low squat hold where legs break the 90 degree angle to get real low. Thanks Shut-in

## Thang Two

- Partner Up
    - Dora 2/4/6
        - 200 Merkins
        - 400 LBC
        - 600 Squats
    - Partner 1 ran the diamond while partner 2 worked.
- I worried a bit about halfway through that we would not finish the work but as we had a few minutes left there were a couple of groups that finished... So it was good even though we all did not finish.

## Run back to Skate Park for Mary

- A few of the PAX helped to call these final exercises
    - Homer to Marge
    - American Hammers
    - Have a Nice Day

## COT

- 32 PAX
- Announcements
    - 2ndF Lunch at Smokey's on Friday 12pm

Thanks for letting me lead today guys. I enjoyed it and look forward to doing again soon
