This Guy! for a solo EC run. While running I couldn't get the song "All by Myself" out of my head, when I thought I might be all alone for the workout. So I'd like to present for discussion a new word to the Lexicon...

```
The Eric Carmen, a workout where you are all by yourself.
```

However that didn't last long as I saw Pet Sounds and Theismann pull into the parking lot for the ME

Mosey to Kelly Rd Park

**Warm-Up  
**Good Morning, Windmill, Steve Earle, SSH, Mnt. Climber, Plank Jack

Mosey down greenway to under 540

**Thang One  
**Find an ego rock for 3 rounds of rotating rock curls, shoulder presses, rows and LBCs and Burpees

Mosey back to the park but utilizing the hill for a little Quadraphillia. 5x backwatds run up the hill, forward down.

**Thang Two  
**Two rounds of picnic table L/R Step Ups, Dips and Derkins then over to the wall for BTTW and People's Chair.

Mosey back to the location where the flag usually waves stopping at the bike racks for dips, Australian Push Ups and Erkins

**Mary  
**100s

**COT**  
No announcements  
Prayers/Praises: Pet Sound's friend getting over COVID, Theismann's wife and brother on the front line and all those working in healthcare

YHC took us out with an anynonmous quote

> "Peace does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart."
