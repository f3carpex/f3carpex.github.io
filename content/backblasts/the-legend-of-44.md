15 HIMs joined me for my VQ on a cold, dark morning at the finest AO on a Thursday morning in NW Cary.

After months of PAX asking if I owned a fruit stand, if my last name was Darling or if I accidentally forgot my F3 name (and received a girl's name), today I shared the origins of Clementine, as well as a brief history on the Legend of 44 at Syracuse University (go Orange!).

_Number 44 at Syracuse University is one of the most fabled numbers ever associated with a college football program. Since 1954, 11 players have worn the number and three have earned All-American honors. Those three—Jim Brown, Ernie Davis, and Floyd Little—rank among the finest running backs ever to play the college game._

GREETINGS & SALUTATIONS: Welcome, no FNGs, pledge allegiance and mosey to the middle school parking lot.

WARM UP: 10 Good Mornings and 10 Cotton Pickers - followed by another mosey to the elementary school parking lot. 44 SSHs, 44 Ernie Davis Heismans (some very interesting form by many of the PAX) and 44 Sir Fazios (all 2 sets of 22)

THANG 1: Mosey to the bus circle and continue the "44s". Start with 11 merkins, run a lap, 11 more Merkins, run a lap...all the way to 44. Follow merkins with 44 LBCs and laps, and another 22 Burpees (thanks Beaker), another 22 Curb Dips - for a total of 44 - and laps.

THANG 2: Over-prepped YHC calls an audible and scraps additional 44s with rocks (saving for Q) and orders a two-line Indian run back to the middle school parking lots. Begin abbreviated "5s" with Star Jumps and High Knee Tucks. Mosey again.

THANG 3: Arrive at BB court with 10 minutes to spare - YHC calls for people's choice Mary. HIMs blessed with a smorgasbord Box Cutters, American Hammers, WW2s, Copperhead Merkins, Freddie Mercs and many, many more exercises. Finally...Have a Nice Day.

AFTERMATH: Prayers for Swag's M; Reminders for Krispy Kreme and CARPEX Challenges; many thanks to Lawn Dart for taking us out; FELLOWSHIP continued at Dunkin's

Thanks for the direct and indirect support by everyone in F3 over the past 5 months. Getting up in the pitch black (and cold) for 3, 4 or 5 days per week to workout isn't easy, but it is the positive peer pressure, fitness and fellowship that keeps me motivated. Look forward to my next Q and running through some more 44s.
