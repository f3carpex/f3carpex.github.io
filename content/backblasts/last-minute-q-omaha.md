13 PAX gathered, and some were hoping for a Squatter Q. Others got the Slack message the Squats would be resting up for the Maynard and YHC would be jumping in with quotes and 100's and other fun stuff. Several (I believe 5) for pre-run. No FNGs.

Thang - Jog to Chanticleers for a standard warm-up and some merkins. Then for some light pole fun. 3 hand release merkins (signature move!) at each light pole all the way up to US 1. Gather the 6, then back down with light pole stops for 5 star jumps. Head into the Parkway Office complex and partner up. Opposite way around the traffic circle, one bear crawls, the other broad jumps, do each twice. Small parking lot for death **Squats** and merkins, 2 set of each. Traffic circle, P1 runs, P2 lunge-walk - do each 7 times. Next small lot for irkins and plank jacks, 2 sets of each. Jog to building, partners go opposite directions running, when you meet 10 partner merkins. Meet 4 times. Return to the basketball court for LBCs, Freddy Mercs, and **100s**.

COT - Announcement about KK 2020, and Amazon list for Liverpool and Water Wings trip. YHC took us out.

\- I haven't been to this site in several months, and it used to be my Tuesday regular. Glad to be back, won't stay away so long next time.  
\- #truth, I really enjoy Wake Zone and the FMJ coffeteria crowd. When I asked at COT where coffeteria was, NOTHING but blank stares.  
\- I forgot to bring a Squatter quote...........but I did Q 100s.  
"Thanks for Qing Large - you do such a great job of leading, even if you do wear shorts over your tights...........now stop stealing my drinking in picture pose!!!" - Squatter (probably)
