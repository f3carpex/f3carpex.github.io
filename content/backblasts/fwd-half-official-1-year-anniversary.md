July 17, 2017.  I ventured out a boy in search of Fitness, Fellowship and Faith.  I found it at the Monday site, Kryptonite.  Here we are one year later, YHC leading the PAX for my 1 year Anniversary at Flirtin With Disaster.

Quick awkward intro to the PAX and we are off.  Your leader/guide/q for the morning....

Warm Up

- Fellowship pace jog over to the CrossFit parking lot
    - Random Warm up at varying cadence/count:  Good mornings, SSH, Merkins, Hillbilly, Merkins, Lastly, "free" Monkey Humpers facing the windows of CrossFit.
    - Lottso MC about Crossfit, Half's watch, etc.
    - PAX circled up and headed back to the site

The THANG

- Grab a rock, a hang out rock
- 15 Rock Curls, followed by OverHead Rock Run around the circle
- 15 Rock Rows, followed by Traveling Rock Lunges around the circle
- 15 Rock Presses, followed by Rock Run around the circle

Typical Rock work chatter from Ma Bell and Hermes.  Dad jokes were explained to Navin/Naveen/Nevin

Whats that in the distance?  Its a bird, its a plane, its....CAPTAIN KIRK.  Coming in hot roughly 17 minutes late.  CK arrives and immediately wants a word with Nantan and Shut In.  Something about wrong starting time....Nonetheless, you show up late, we do BURPEES.  10 OYO Burpees

PAX travel to the Bridge over US1.  Partner up

DORA 1-2-3

100 Diamond Merkins.  200 Monkey Jumpers.  300 LBC.

Partner 2 runs across bridge, down the ramp to the other side.  5 Donkey Kicks.  To add more flair, every crossing of the bridge commands 2 Pull Ups or 5 Squats

Fellowship Pace back to the basketball court for American Hammers until our time was up.

COT

Sappy speech from YHC.  But in all seriousness I am incredibly thankful that GOD led me to F3.  I am a better man/father/son of god for it.

Announcements:  Smokey Anniversary coming soon, F3 Dads this Saturday

Prayers:  Goose and his Family

NMS

- Someone please clarify Navin's F3 name and proper pronunciation.
- Hermes Dad Jokes are still Lit
- Captain Kirk needs a new paper sheet with each AO's starting time.  The internets must not work for him...
- Riptide Spotting at Tritan
