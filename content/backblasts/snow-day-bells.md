I hurt my right foot a few weeks ago, and not wanting to twist it up on the ice I decided to bring the bells back to Dante's Peak. Showed up and one of the new Site-Q's said his completely dry driveway was completely impassible.

### Warm-Up

Quick jog around the lower parking lot, and almost slipped a few times so decided there be minimal running for the rest of the Q.

### Thang 1: KB Tabatas

30 seconds work and 10 seconds rest 8 cycles for 3 rounds of the following exercises:  
\- Burpees rest then Swings  
\- Tricep Extensions rest then Curls  
\- Squat Thrusters then Mountain Climbers

### Thang 2: EMOM

Burpees and 20 swings in a minute. 4 times.

### Thang 3: Snow 7's

7's across the short side of the soccer field per Shut-In's request. Exercises were Merkins and Jump Squats.
