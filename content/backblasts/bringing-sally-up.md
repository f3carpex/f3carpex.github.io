A F3 mentor taught me long ago to only Q what you can do. A nice catchy phrase and one that I have tried to adhere to. I believe as the Q it's important to lead by example in attitude, effort and execution of all exercises called. When a man volunteers to lead other men he wants to be his best on that day in every way he can. Ideally all of the above falls in place for every Q everyday. But sometimes the Q spots an exercise that he has never attempted himself but thinks "Man, that just looks like a great one to try with the guys" and that's as far as the thinking goes. Not always, but sometimes, this can result in the Q calling something that he can't do.

With no FNGs we Pledge our Allegiance. A couple laps around the pickle with High knee, Butt kicker, Cariocas, Bear Crawl, Crawl Bear. Circle up for Warm-up

Warm up - Steve Earle, Good Morning

Mosey to the underpass for Thang 1

Thang 1 - Dora 1,2,3 100 In/Out, 200 1 legged Homer-to-Marge, 300 Seal Claps. Partner 2 runs up the path to the first light and back. Flap jack

Mosey back to our origination for Thang 2

Thang 2 - Bring Sally Up - Merkin Challenge. Watch the video. It's impressive. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41N6bKO-NVI From the moment I saw this I knew it would be a crowd please. I suppose there's no shame in calling an exercise you can't complete when that exercise is ridiculously challenging so long as you've put a ridiculous amount of effort into it and never stop fighting.

Thang 3 - The Coach - Partner up into groups of 3. Partner 1 performs a pull up and holds in the up position while partner 2 takes on the role of the Coach. It's the Coach's responsibility to encourage P1 to give his best effort, to push through the pain, to do whatever it takes to stay in the up position while P3 sprints around the pickle one time. Upon P3's arrival P1 comes down from the pullup and gives P2 a high five for being a great coach. P1 will now sprint the pickle while P2, goes up on the bar. P3 is now the coach. This cycle continues until everyone has had a turn at all three positions. Repeat until all pax have lost their voices, arms have fallen off, or the Q is ready to move on.
