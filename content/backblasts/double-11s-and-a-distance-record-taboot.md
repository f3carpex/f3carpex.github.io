**Pre-Blast**

- 7 HIM joined YHC to set a distance record at BIB: 3.51 miles. Repeato was the lone site Q, but he was not alone.

**The Warmup**

- Pledge of Allegiance at the...no shovel flag to be found.
- Run to the parking lot next door, find a hill, circle up for: GM, Windmills, SSH.

****T**he T**hang**s**

11s on the hill with burpees at the top and bottom.

11s on the hill with dying cockroaches at the top and crab cakes at the bottom.

Run back to the...lot where the shovel flag should've been planted.

**COT**
