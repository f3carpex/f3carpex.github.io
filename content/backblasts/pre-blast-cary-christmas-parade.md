**What:** F3 Carpex with a truck and walkers in the Cary Christmas Parade

**When:** Saturday, December 8th from 1-4pm

**Why:** It's high-time we kicked our gorilla (monkey humper) marketing up a notch. Come have some great 2nd F while sharing with folks about F3 Carpex. 2.0s are welcome to attend and walk and/or be on Dad's shoulders for the parade. We might even put Rip's truck in neutral and push it along the parade route...
