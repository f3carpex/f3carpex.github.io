8/17/17 YHC decided that since no pounds have been shed in about 4 months, there has to be another way to measure my F3 fitness quotient....

WARM-UP On this fine August morning the 19 PAX headed west on Hunter St to the Bladestone Ct parking lot for a little stretching and warm-up. A few SSH, merkins, calf stretches and good mornings was all we needed (no arm circles today boys...).

THE THANG There's hardly a better way to test your individual progress than to race against the clock. So, a window of 20 mins was given to complete the following as many times as possible: 5 Pull-ups 10 Merkins 15 Squats 1 Lap around the track

We decided to record each man's progress for historical purposes, in order to have a goal for the next Water Wings Q...

After time was up the PAX moseyed east on Hunter St back to the shovel flag to wrap up with a little Mary.

Total distance covered ended up being just over 3 miles. Good work men!
