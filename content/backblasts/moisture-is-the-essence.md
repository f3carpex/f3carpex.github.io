**AO:** The Green Mile  
**Workout Date:** 08/14/21  
An hour and a half long workout in the middle of Summer sounds like a great plan! We took multiple hydration breaks. Water is important, just ask the guy getting electrocuted in The Green Mile.

**Warm Up:**  
State the mission, check for FNGs(0), and give the disclaimer.

Announcements and Prayers

**Naked Moleskin:**  
I did not take into account the dip in the parking lot for those 7-11s. Felt like we were in a half pipe.  
It was darn hot, we took multiple water breaks.  
100 burpees was a bit much, but we were so close, why not?  
Coffeeteria always wins.  
This was my ninety-third #F3Q21 #2021Challenge Q (ninety-seventh overall). Next Q is Monday at Mutiny in South Wake.
