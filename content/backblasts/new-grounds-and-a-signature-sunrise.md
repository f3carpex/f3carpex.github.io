**Strava:**  3 miles [https://www.strava.com/activities/1573186828](https://www.strava.com/activities/1573186828)

Got to nab the Q from Hi-Liter this week.  It's becoming tougher and tougher to get a Q spot if you don't plan more than 2 weeks in advance.  That's something Carpex can be proud of!

Something else to be proud of is to leave the pax breathless at COT and better than where you found them at the start of the day!

Let's see how we did!

**Warm Up**  -  Shut-In Signature Warm Up (look it up.)

### The Thang

- Run out of the parking lot and up Thurston.
- AMRAP ARMs until the 6 has done 10
- Run to roundabout lunge walk until the 6 passes you then continue run to the powerlines.

**Hill Work**

- 10 Diamond Curb Urkins at the bottom  /  5 Star Jumps at the top
- Rinse / Repeat until the 6 has done 5 sets

**To the Bridge**

- Run down the greenway to the intersection.  Lunge walk until the 6 passes you then continue to the bridge.
- Bear Crawl as far as you can across the bridge without stopping or switching exercise.  Upon failure get up and run the rest of the way.

**To the Park**

- Indian Run to the pocket park.  YHC's first time here.  Not the first time for some pax.
- Another 5 sets of 5 L/R Step Ups each leg, run a lap on ramp, 10 Urkin Claps

**Head Home**

- Run to bridge for **THE GREATEST AO #SIGNATUREMOVE IN ALL OF CARPEX!**
- THE INVERTED SUNRISE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- Recover, head to parking lot
- Grab a giant ball for Aussie Mtn Climbers (a YHC favorite)
- Finish at the flag

My pleasure fellas.
