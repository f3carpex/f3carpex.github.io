Christmas morning, 2019. What a great way to start the day - with my F3 brothers!

## Warm Up

Following the Pledge, PAX are given gifts of a card with an exercise that they call. All the way around the horn until complete.

## The Thang

Mosey to the Townside Drive hill, with a couple stops along the way. Christmas day Triple Nickel - 5 pullups at the top of the hill, 5 burpees at the bottom of the hill, 5 sets each. Once complete and the 6 is collected, mosey back to the flag.

## Mary

Captain Thor up to 10:40. Have a Nice Day

## COT

A cool dozen PAX, with one Respect and FOUR Hates!

## NMS

- Awesome morning getting Christmas day started right
- Coffee afterwards was ON POINT!
- We worked hard, well done. There was one tank top spotted in the middle of the workout
- For the Catholics, this could count as Mass
- MIAGD!
