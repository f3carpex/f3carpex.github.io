COTOdyssey this Saturday, TCP Sawgrass Nov 1Various prayers were shared.

  
YHC shared the following: Somewhere along the way, comfort became the key to happiness, the big house, lots of things, maybe a comfortable car with heated seats. Yet these material things never seem to make us happy. In the process we have softened both mentally and physically. Somewhere we lost our way. I challenged the men to do hard things so they can then enjoy some comforts, though never relinquishing the continual activity of doing hard things, to stay sharp, nimble and adaptable. 

Exercises

Single-Leg Step-Downs, unlike traditional step-ups, start with both feet on the planter box, let your body fall back to the ground. When the foot hits the ground, step up again. It should feel like a soft, controlled bounce off the ground, almost like you are running, but with the leg on the box doing almost all of the work. Repeat in rhythm, feeling your quad, hips, and butt fatigue rapidly. 10-20 per leg then switch legs. 

Forward Lunge. Start with the classic forward lunge, stepping forward until your opposite (back) knee touches the ground softly, planting majority of weight on forward leg, then returning to center. Do 10-20 on each leg, then alternate.

Rear Lunge. Repeat the same exercise, but stepping backward this time, until the knee on the leg you are stepping with gently touches the ground, maintaining majority of weight on the forward leg, then return to center. Do 10-20 on each leg, then alternate.
