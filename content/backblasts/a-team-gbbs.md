Super excited to Q at A-Team this morning -- it's one of my favorite sites and is always loaded with High Impact Men. Speaking of HIM, @petsounds was there! So great to see him back in the gloom! Bootcamp-wise, I felt like trying something new -- here's what went down.... 15 total pax, 9 bootcampers, the remainers bruising/walking + 4 legged Manny!

Pledge of course! Then mosey straight into the park to the top of the powerline hill for warm-up: good morning, windmill, hill-billy, mtn climbers, merkins, etc. Mosey down to the basketball courts for thang 1:

Whoops, forgot that I wanted to warm-up shoulders because thang 1 was going to work 'em -- so added Sir Fazios & overhead claps on the court.... also asked the PAX to pair up with a GBB -- get to know each other a bit & encouragement....now we can do **thang 1:**

Bear crawl in cadence (yes!) to mid-court for the famously modified Jack Webb -- started with 1 merkin & 40 alleluias, then bear crawl, 2 merkins & 36 alleluias, crawl 3/32, crawl 4/28.... you get the picture all the way to 10/4. Not a lot of mumblechatter that's for sure! Mosey down to the end pickle for **thang #2:**

21's changing by 2 around the pickle -- started with 19 monkey humpers & 2 (2 count) freddy mercs. GBBs stuck together -- was great!

Mosey to the bottom of the hill to the "bridge" for some rail work (**thang #3** I guess): couple sets each of irkins, squats, and dips. Finished at the front lot and met up with the others for mary (plank you very much!)/CoT.

**Name-a-rama**: 7 respects, 8 meh, 1 dog

Announcements: This Friday, April 2nd, Stations of the Cross Good Friday bootcamp at Danger Zone

**Prayers & Praises**: Prayers for Michelob recovering from a bike crash, prayers for How How as he broke is darn leg! and praises for the continued recovery of Petsounds who was there with us today!

**NMS**: I didn't feel too well as there was little sleep last night but getting moving with my F3 brothers is exactly what I needed. So fortunate that great men are out there every morning to pick each other up. I am greatful.
