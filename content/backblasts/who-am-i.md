Have been wanting to pull this Q out for a few weeks ever since my son's confirmation retreat.

**Warm up:**

Mosey to the big Koka parking lot for GM, Abe Vigoda, SSH, IW, Merkins and Eye of the Needle stretches.

**Thang**:

Asked the PAX to think about the answer to the question: "who am I". Took turns sharing our answers, with answer-appropriate workouts tossed in.

In our group we had a hospital name (7x burpees), husband (24 years merkins), lawyer (99 problems LBCs), financial adviser (3 million dollars wolverines), a child of God (WWIIs), a literary and musical hero (star jumps) and a father. I know I'm forgetting a few but I am thankful for your openness and the conversation it engendered.

**Thang 2:**

Dips and Quick Feet. Start with 13 dips and work down; 10 quick feet at the top. Mini 'hill' in the parking lot.

Mosey back to the flag.

**Mary**

- LBC
- E2K
- Freddy Merk
- Heel touches
- Superman

**COT**:

- 11 PAX, including a couple respects
- BiB is looking to fill up the Q sheet.
- Prayers for Cauliflower's MIL, Crimson's family, Repeato's wife and Flint -- who left us too soon

**NMS**

- BiB starts eeeearly. Barely had time for my morning constitutional. Arrived with less than a minute to spare.
- Next time I'll do like Full House.
- We went down the rabbit hole at coffeeteria this morning. Elon, crypto currencies and discussion of school reopening yielded to introduction for many of us - me included - into the nutty world of cryptosourvenirs. $250,000 to 'own' a reply of a Zion swat that you can literally watch for free on the same page where you can buy said replay. Getting old.
- Bagels for breakfast were legit.
