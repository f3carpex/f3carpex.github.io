This was Q #5 and I keep thinking about what makes for a good beat down.

If yesterday at BH was a pan-seared steak and then put in the oven to finish, today was all about the slow cook, a nice crockpot set on the counter emitting aromas that fill the house with love and warmth.

Hanson and YHC showed up for EC and ECP respectively. If you ever have a chance to run some EC with Hanson you won't regret the push and the fellowship. He is a solid HIM.

**Warm-Up**

Karaoke and some regular mosey down to our normal warm up circle where everybody knows your name.

- Prisoner Squats
- Hill Billies
- Sir Fazio
- Reverse Sir Fazio
- Good Mornings
- SSH
- Merkins

**Thang 1** – Dora 1.5, 3, 4.5

Groups of 3 Pax on the Soccer Field (Both were unlocked - \*insert giddy laugh here\*)

Pax 1 moseyed down to the opposite side line and started doing

- Type Writers - quick steps over and back across the end line - 20
- Knee Jumps - hands out in front, jump up and have your knees hit your hands - 20
- Repeato until Pax 2 gets to you

Pax 2 waited for Pax 1 to start and then started the run down the field to swap with Pax 1

Pax 3 started in on:

- 150 Merkins
- 300 LBCs
- 450 Squats

**Thang 2 -** Pond Visit and Step Ups

If you are keeping count we are up to 900 reps, and the goal today was a 1000 per my pre-blast.

- Colt 45s = 945
- Step Ups +50 = 995
- 5 Pull Ups and head back to the flag = 1000

Awesome work by everyone at DP today, it was a slow burn through out the entire work out and got a nice 1.75 miles in.
