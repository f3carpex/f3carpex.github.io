This morning was another chilly day...there were plenty of sleeves at post time 0530. Some of those sleeves came off as we got warmed up, others didn't. We're in a weird spot right now CARPEX...beautiful days and chilly mornings. Today's highlight (or lowlight depending on how you look at it) was literally hearing every hunting story Bubba has ever had. I feel like he lives in his blinds...and apparently drains entire lakes of their frogs for his witches brew he concocts. On to the workout!
