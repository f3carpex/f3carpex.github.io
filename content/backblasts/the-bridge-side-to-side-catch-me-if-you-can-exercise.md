Rollcall on Insta:  [**Video Here**](https://www.instagram.com/p/BkNCkhpFQ5t/?taken-by=f3carpex) Beatdown on Strava:  **[https://www.strava.com/activities/1648034732](https://www.strava.com/activities/1648034732)**

YHC's first time running in to an AO.  New (temporary) living quarters put me about 1.5 miles away from FWD.  Upon arriving at the parking lot a car was already there and the pax was missing.  A few minutes later Chipper runs out of the shadows and explains he had a little insomnia so he decided to EC run 3 miles.  Whatever floats your boat I guess.

Speaking of boats, YHC feels like he's fallen out of a boat after every workout so far this month.  I don't remember it being this humid in years past.  Makes me eager for February fun...(exaggerating for effect.)

Let's get down to work:

- YHC announces no gloves needed.
- Disclaimer
- Run to and circle the big balls lot for the Standard Shut-In Warmup.
- Run down greenway to the fork.  **20 Merkins / 20 Squats,** meet you at the center of the bridge
- **Lazy 7s:  Pull-Ups and Aussie Mtn Climbers**
- Mozy to other end of the bridge, partner up.
- P1 run down to bottom of ramp **10 Urkins** / P2 **mary** (YHC did not plan this but YHC could not breathe, needed a break...) Flapjack
- Go back to middle of the bridge for these things that have no name **(Bridge Side-to-Side Catch Me If You Can):**
    - P1 plank next to the left side of the fence / P2 plank on the left side of the fence facing P1 (opposite sides of the bridge but facing each other.
    - On YHC's command side shuffle in plank position going back and forth from L to R side of the bridge.  At each end do 1 merkin.
    - The goal is to try and catch up and "lap" your partner.  You face each other so you can see where your partner is the whole time.
    - We did 2 sets and my gosh it suuuuuuuuucked.
- YHC was drowning in humidity and needed **more Mary**.
- **Catch Me If You Can back to the giant balls - 3 HRMs** (or 5...cant remember)
- Grab 1 rock for your P1/P2 group
- **P1 does Burpee Inchworm with the rock / P2 takes a lap / flapjack**
- Finish after 1 burpee lap around the lot.
- Everyone LOVED IT!!!!!!!
- All you got oh wait, what's that?  Complaining?  Want Shutty to get angry?
- **10 Burpees**.  Ya happy!!?

 

Thank YHC for YHCs leadership.
