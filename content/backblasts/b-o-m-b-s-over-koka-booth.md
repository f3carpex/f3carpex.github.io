6 PAX huddled under the LED lights in the mini parking lot, anxiously awaiting the 5:30 start time.  5 seconds to go time and Flip Flop fires in to make 7.  We meet him at his car and we are off....sorta.

YHC had not posted at Kryptonite in some time.  Little did I know the Greenway and access to Pavilion is current closed.  Never the less we circled up in front of the Gates and began warm up

WARM UPS

SSH, Willy Mays Hays(was called but Q began doing Windmills(DOH!)...YHC was flustered with the greenway closure and was too busy pondering the audible), Willy Mays Hays..FOR REAL, Merkins, Plank Hold, Mountain Climbers

Two Indian Groups formed for 3 -4 man Indian Runs to Half's Hill, up Regency Parkway, to the hill in front of ABB Office Building.  The pace was strong with the lead group, full of mumble chatter and laughter.  While the second group was struggling to stay warm and to keep up the pace.  Good mornings were said to the Camp Gladiator Sirens, while Pet Sounds chimed in with a Cat Call...J/k

COT

YHC reflected upon his experience at F3 Arena this past Friday. Shut In informed the group of a dinner with the Healing Transitions folks on December 6th. Convergence on Thursday and HC for Flag Football at Burts.

Prayers were asked for Largemouth and M as they expect the 2.0 any day now.  Also, prayers for Wilbur as he continues evaluations for his most recent hospital visit.
