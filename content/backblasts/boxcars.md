Every year on the Ides of March, YHC has the distinct honor to celebrate the anniversary of his first F3 post. Today on the 6th installment I was honored once again to do so with my F3 Carpex brothers.

We gathered outside the open gates\* of Apex Community Park, home of A-Team, and noted the peak spring gloom, having endured a full 26 hours of Daylight Savings Time. 3/4ths of the ShieldRuck was on hand, one in a Cubs jersey #oversight. One ruck was present, and it was not on Burt's back.

At the appointed time, plus a few seconds of mild cursing at the GPS, we moseyed into the park, through the open gates\*, and meandered our way to a parking lot to warm up. Not the exact spot I'd have chosen, as said spot was taped off like a giant crime scene - but most likely just a would-be construction zone.

## Warm-up

- SSH x20 IC
- Calf stretch
- Merkin x15 in honor of Ma Bell who Q'd my first post. The PAX should've guessed at this point that this was not to be a replica Q, as we'd have done more merkins.
- MC x15 IC
- Good Morning x5 SLOOOOOWWW #cantHaveAGreatDay
- Bartmarmorama - Fazio forward, reverse, overhead clap, seal clap, Moroccan nightclub

## Thang 1

Back to the front parking lot with ample pickle, for The Beast. That's right, six stops, six reps each, six rounds:

- Hand-release merkin
- V-up
- Lunge (L/R=1)
- CDD
- LBC (4-count)
- Sumo squat

Various squat/plank/LBC while the six catches up.

Mosey back to the back lot near where the flag used to be planted\*.

## Thang 2

Route 66. First light pole, 1 burpee. Second light pole, 2 burpees, up to 11. A little gaussian arithmetic leads you to 66 total reps.

## 6MOM

Well, maybe not 6 minutes, more like 2 minutes, 2/3rds of which was after the 45-minute buzzer. Flutter kicks IC x36, or you could look at it like 72 up/down, one for every F3 month.

## NMM

There was some discussion about the flag location (\*), with at least two Carpex old-timers pining for the days when the flag was planted in the park, and the outside-the-gates location was used only as a backup. It added a certain degree of uncertainty to the whole affair, which certain old-timers think adds to the experience. Will it rain? (probably.) Will we have to park on the road? (possibly.) Will 75% be there today? (those were the days...)

We'll see if the ramblings of a couple of old-timers amount to much in the way of IMPACT.
