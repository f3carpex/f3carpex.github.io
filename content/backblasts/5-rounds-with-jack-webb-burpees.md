Life always comes at you where you just feel worn out but you keep trudging along.  Then you do an F3 workout and it starts the day off right to get you through those times.  Life is a blessing but it can pass you up if you do not take deep breaths to clear the cobwebs to see clearly.  Waking up to workout in the gloom is exactly what most of us or all of us need to feel alive.  Great to see new faces because it shows growth in our community.

F3 admin done.  Pledge Our Allegiance to Old Glory.  Mosey to truck for some coupons.

Circle up to warm-up.  GM, Abe Vigodas, hamstring stretch, runner's stretch, Eskimo merks to 12 count.

Thang:

Modified Jack Webb Burpees and curls with coupons.

1 burpee with coupon to 4 curls, 2 coupon burpees to 8 curls; run around the astro-turf field.  Do 3 coupon burpees to 12 curls and 4 coupon burpees to 16 curls; run around the astro-turf field.  Repeato until you complete 5 rounds total.

Time for Mary.  WWII with coupon x 10.  WWII with coupon with l/r jabs x 10. American Hammers.  Hand release burpees x 10 on my down.
