7 HIMS for 10 rounds with Mike Tyson (Yogi style).

It was in the sub-20s this morning and it was essential to get going quickly to get the body warmed up.

YHC quickly did some quick calisthenics so we could get to the workout. Getting 10 rounds in within 45 mins pushes the time.

Thang: 5 stops with 10 reps / stop

Round 1: Diamond merkins

Round 2: LBC (4 count)

Round 3: Squats

Round 4: Standard merkins

Round 5: Flutter kicks

Round 6: Lunge 5 each leg

Round 7: Wide-grip merkin

Round 8: Box cutters

Round 9: Jump Squats

Round 10: Burpees

We finished just in time for a few Mary exercises.

COR: 7

NOR: HIMs

NMS:

I stole the workout from Yogi which we did at Tortoises the week prior. It drains you when you're done.

It's always a blessing to be out in the gloom with these HIMs.

Life is a blessing!!!
