YHC comes tearing in to the parking lot at Waldo Street in DTC @0540...there is a large crowd gathered nearby.  Larger than normal.  What ever shall we do?  Sabre has an FNG in tow, so YHC gives a quick disclaimer.  This is gonna be fun.

**Warm Up**

- First exercise, Pledge of Allegiance
- Calf stretch
- Mosey to the big circle to show off for early commuters
- Lots of mumblechatter
- SSHs x 50
- Less mumblechatter
- Cotton pickers, Hill Billies, Plank Jacks, Merkins on my down AND up, maybe something else YHC forgot
- Extended warm up with Jack Webb - counted up to 10 merkins/40 air presses
- Did I say 10 burpees?

**Thang 1**

Split up PAX, send 1s on the left hand side of the street and 2s on the other side.  Each PAX completes at the first 10 street lights:

- 10 Merkins
- 15 Monkey Humpers
- 20 Dying Cock-a-roaches

Complete as a team, then mosey to the fountain for...

**Thang 2**

Circle the fountain, complete 5 Wall Jump Burpees.  Take a fountain lap, then complete 4 Wall Jump Burpees.  Until you finish 1.

Get back in your teams, and Indian Run back to Waldo Street.  Then we take a Billy Run back to the flag for...

**Mary**

PAX choice of favorite Mary exercises, finish off with some Homer-to-Marge (for our FNG).  Pierogi calls some awful Hurricane things that basically consist of a lot of low slow flutters.

**COT**

- 31 total, including FNG Resume. It's REZ-u-may...as in he has an impressive CV.  I also heard Resume called a cadence count like a pro!  There were about 3 Hates in there, and a few Respects
- Announcements: VQ week next month, the picnic has been postponed, F3 Dads being rescheduled I think.  Maybe some other stuff.
- Prayers & Praises: Those in the path of Florence, Cheddar Bo's family, Loom's daughter, Crimson & Sooey's friends Dave & Joanne.  Joanne is in ICU and not doing well.
- YHC took us out.

**NMS**

- Great large group for a pre-hurricane BO!
- When Burt handed out the Tanks, WWW got one on the smallish side.
- Burt, Flip Flop, Hermes, Kitty, Frisco and some others all together = MC Madness
- Loom is clearly a Monkey-Humper specialist.  Great cadence count and TY4YL.
