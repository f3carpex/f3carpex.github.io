I’ve wanted to try to a music themed workout for a while now and figured that FWD would be the perfect spot to break it out. Toyed with a few concepts including just going with good music, but decided to work a little harder and try to tie the exercises with the songs. I don’t want to give away the tunes, but the following decades are represented

60s – one song 70’s – four 80’s – three 90’s – one

Bands from those periods that are not represented

Hanson Captain & Tennille Milli Vanilli Air Supply Starland Vocal Band Hall & Oates ‘n’ Sync

If you aren’t familiar with this park, there is a dragon that is half way buried in a hill. I avoided the temptation to roll out a Peter, Paul & Mary tune from 1963
