"Hey, it's 5:43, we should probably stop doing pull-ups and head over to the flag." With that, 3 of the 8 total PAX we'd have for Claymore today made their way to the area where the flag sometimes rests. That is, when a site Q shows up to Claymore and has a flag.

And with that, Frisco comes in hot, on 2 wheels tearing into the parking lot.

With the flag.

Silently in his new electric ride.

Disclaimer was given and the mission of F3 was stated. First exercise, pledge of allegiance.

## Warm Up

SSHs, Sir Fazio, Seal Claps, Plank Jacks, CF Merkins and Steve Earles

## The Thang

Short mosey to the pickle by the tennis courts. Time for a Sharknado - sort of. Consisted of:

- 15 Burpees, bear crawl 1 lap
- 20 Diamond merkins, lunge walk 1 lap
- 20 WWII Sit-ups, bear crawl 1 lap
- 20 Merkins, lunge walk 1 lap
- 20 Scorpion Dry Docks, bear crawl 1 lap
- Repeat for 25 minutes total

Once the PAX had finished, mosey to the parking lot near the playground. Partner up in groups of 3. Partner 1 does LBCs, while Partner C runs to the playground and does 5 pull-ups. Complete about 3 rounds of this, then back to the flag.

## Mary

American Hammers, CF Merkins, Have a Nice Day

## COT

3 Respects, 1 Hate, 4 Mehs. Announcements were announced, prayers and praises were given, and YHC took us out.

## NMS

- TCEPs for Cory Gensler, son of Press On, for being named the Big South Conference Men's Basketball Scholar-Athlete of the Year! I could go on and on about Cory and his family, but I'll just say this is very well deserved.
- We covered 0.95 miles!
- The playlist was heavy GnR today, but we finished up with a little Cherry Pie by Warrant. Who doesn't remember THAT video???
- Doing a Sharknado like this is really freaking hard. We didn't strictly keep numbers because there was a good amount of modification needed. YHC completed 2.0 rounds and it all sucked.
- TClaps to Sputnik for bringing Half-Pike out. Remember our little guys and girls are always watching us. Set the right example.
- We finished up with a pick of the boys in blue in honor of Dear Diary, and his fight against cancer. Stay strong brother!
- Begin your day with integrity. Fill your day with integrity. And finish the day as you started. Credit to Khakis for this message and theme.
- With that said, MIAGD and be just a smidge better than yesterday!
