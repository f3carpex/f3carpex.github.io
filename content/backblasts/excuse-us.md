I knew the site-Qs were beginning to sweat as YHC rolled in with about 45 seconds to spare. I have a morning route and was running a touch behind even though I had already been awake for 50 minutes. Alas, 25 pax had gathered and were eager for a challenge as the clock read "Go time". Disclaimer, Pledge of Allegiance, Follow Me.

Warm-up: Mosey around the soccer and baseball field then back to skateboard park for some exercises. Side Straddle Hop, Steve Earle, J-Lo, Superman, Daisy Picker, Dive Bombers, Good Mornings. Upon completion we hit the road for Baucom Elementary School playground for Thang 1.

Thang 1: The Burp-up - Partnering up perform 100 burp-ups as a team while one of you is running the 250m playground loop. With 25 guys that's 12 groups performing 100 burp-ups and 1 lone ranger. That's about 1250 burp-ups! Jeez guys where's our manners?

Thang 2: Gorilla Hops??? maybe... - From the squatted position walk hand out about two feet then hop your feet to meet them. Continue for the length of a small basketball court. Repeato. Upon completion we mosied back to the flag for Mary stopping to PUT6 along the way.

Mary: Runners Stretch, Pickle Pounders, Good Mornings
