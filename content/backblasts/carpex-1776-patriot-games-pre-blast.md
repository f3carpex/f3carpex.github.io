What started as a seemingly innocuous GroupMe post by Banjo for a July 4th workout at an AO down in Florida turned into a storm of comments, excitement, emails, whining, etc. What came out of that is a plan for a 1776-themed CarPEX Nation convergence on the 241st anniversary of America's declaration of independence from the tyranny of Mad King George III. With apologies to our brothers in Florida, we offer the CarPEX version of the _**1776 Patriot Games**_ (with comments added to remove ambiguity)

**Date**: July 4, 1776 **Time**: 0630 EDT **Where**: Thomas Brooks Park **Music**: America-themed, motivational patriotic playlist provided by Ma Bell **#dadjokes**: America-themed jokes provided by PAX

_The order of the workout will be: A.) 1776 yard run together; B.) 1-16 in whatever order you want; C.)

Badges of Honor/Pain

**PATRIOT**: Split the list with one fellow PAX. Both do full bear crawl before sharing the final burpees. **AMERICAN EAGLE**: Complete the list solo.

NMS

Further thanks to Biner for relinquishing his scheduled FoD Q to allow for the convergence.

If folks want to bring coolers of water, gatorade, etc., I don't think it would go to waste.

Sky Blue, you're always welcome to join us. But I can't promise you won't bear the brunt of Hermes' jokes!
