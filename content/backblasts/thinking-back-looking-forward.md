Milestone birthday this week leads me to thinking back through the years, and about the important people who have been and will continue to be involved in my life.  22 PAX started the week off right at A-team this morning for a workout based around this theme.

Warmup

- Fellowship jog to front parking lot
- 49 SSH ID (because not yet)
- 20 MC IC
- 20 Diamond Merkins
- 20 IW IC (with a little Hillbilly thrown in)
- Small group (3-4) Indian run to the back of the park
- Plank it out with some Shakira hip dips while everyone arrives

The Thang

Mosey to the Large Shelter where several copies of the alphabet, along with an exercise for each letter, were scattered across the picnic tables.  Within your group, each PAX chooses a name (or names) of someone important in their life.  The group then spells out that name, doing the corresponding exercise for each letter.  When done with each name, do 1 loop around the parking lot, then next PAX chooses a name.  Continue until times is up.

Indian Run back to front parking lot.

Quick Mary as we are almost out of time
