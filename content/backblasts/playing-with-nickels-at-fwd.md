AO: FLIRTING WITH DISASTER

QIC: WRENCH

PAX: BAGELS, BUTTERFLY, GOOSE, JOE SMITH, LOOKOUT, MA BELL, OLLIE, OOFTA, SCHLITZ, SNIP, SQUATTER, STAUBACH, WRENCH, YOGA MAT

14 gathered under the rain for FWD. 4 got their early and hit the streets for an EC run, I think I heard 3ish miles.

Go time. No FNGs, Disclaimer disclaimed quickly, pledge and we're off. Run around the small loop to circle up. 10 GM, 10 count tricep stretch, 10 count calf stretch with 5 Merkins on YHC's down between. Caught Joe Smith going a little quick here with a hold on #4.

Thang 1: grab a non traveling but challenging rock. 5 OHP, 5 Rock Squats, run to shelter to do 5 wolverines. Come back for 5 OHP, 5 Rock Deadlifts and run back to the shelter for 15 dips (because 5 dips just isn't enough). 5 rounds of that. Squat hold and wait for 6.

Thang 2: keep the rocks. 15 Rock Rows, 15 overhead tricep extensions, run to the shelter for 15 Merkins. 5 rounds of that. Got awfully quiet here for some reason. Overhead carry wait for the 6, around the circle.

Thang 3: Lion King Ladders. Do 5, run a lap, do 10 run a lap, do 15, run a lap, do 10, run a lap, and do 5 and run a lap.

Yoga Mat said in my previous backblasts that my non traveling rocks turn into traveling rocks. I had considered it. And this would have been the time, yet time didn't permit. Darn.

As we Mosey back to do some Mary, I believe it was Squatter who said we are at 1.94, we gotta get 2 since we're so close. So we mosey to the corner of Thurston and Cary Parkway and back. Just under 2.2.

Mary: 5 OYO Burpees, standing have a nice day.

Announcements: Mule 3/14. Kitty's MayHIM 2/22.

Prayers/Praises: Noonan's family, Cataracts continued healing, Family in F3Cherokee. (I feel there was another here, can't think of it now)

YHC took us out, after a pause to reflect on the week so far, and enjoy the beautiful day laid out before us.

NMS: my little dude turns 5 today, so 5s were the common theme here. I'm personally working on my conditioning, and had to push the Q to just out of what I could do (those wolverines, man) to push myself. 13 other fine HIMs working hard on the same really push a guy. Ma Bell had no sleeves, we expected nothing less. Yoga Mat had the trunk coffee, I could not stay but looked like a solid showing for the 2ndF.

It was great to see you guys this morning, thank you gentlemen for letting me lead you this morning, go make it a great day!
