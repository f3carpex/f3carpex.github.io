We gather in the gloomy, very humid, full moon rising edition of Hot for Teacher.  Good, reasonably sized group gathers around the flag for an Earhart beatdown.  We head up across the street (safety first) and down to the upper parking lot in front of the F45 facility, we circle-up for:

## Warm Up

Good Mornings

Sir Fazio

Windmill

Steve Earls

Side Straddle Hops

## The Thang

Done with warm-ups, we head to start of the very large and inviting Publix parking lot for a round of four corners with:

5 burpees

10 squats

15 plank jacks

20 CDDs

On corner three, Q breaks the PAX away for some 7’s because there was a perfect loop running through the Publix pharmacy drive thru; under the drive thru for some merkins and monkey-humpers on the other side.

Time to continue to corner-4 with the above rounds of exercises now fully realized.  We head around the building to the back for a couple rounds of suicides and BTTW.

Back to our corner for another round and then across the parking lot, back to the F45 parking lot for the 5th corner.

Now we mosey over to one of the jewels of HFT, the stone circle.  Picture a 15 foot diameter, 12 foot high circle of pain.  At the circle, we perform 3 rounds of (with a mosey in between each round):

5 box-jump burpees

15 dips

15 irkins

15 left-right step-ups

10 dirkins

Finally done, we bear crawl up the hill and cross the street and back to the flag and circle up for:

## Mary

PAX-led Mary included 10 reps of:

Hammers

LBCs

WW2 Sit-ups

Flutter Kicks

Burpees x2

J-lo’s

Supermans

Dying cockroaches

Bell tolls 6:15 and time to finish.

## COT

**Count-a-rama:**  12 PAX
