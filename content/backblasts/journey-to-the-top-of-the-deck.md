AO: Bradford's Ordinary

QIC: Wrench

Date: 4 June 2020

PAX: Callahan, Captain Kirk, Press On, Flenderson, Riptide, Sosa, McCants, Kwik Stop, Wrench

Tank top Thursday is upon us. Press On called it out on Slack, so I must follow. Digging through my workout clothes I realized that I don't own a tank top (feels Ma Bell give the stink eye from across the interwebs) But it's good, Press On wore enough tank tops to cover most of the PAX.

9 men rally at the flag. 545 hits, disclaim and mission statement, pledge, and we mosey to the grassy area by the fountain for a quick warm up.

10x GM

10 Count tricep stretch

Mosey to the entrance of the deck. Vanilla 11s consisting of squats and Merkins, but we did it square, working our way to the top.

Took a break at the top to soak in the beauty that is the sunrise, and the beauty that comes with being with our brothers.

Trip down, not so vanilla. 11s down, same way squared, bit with plank Jack's and Navy Seal Burpees. Those are not fun, and bring the suck.

Leave the deck, take the long way back to the flag, Sosa and Ripper stopped to smell the flowers. Didn't put it together at the time, but more taking in the beauty of the world.

Mary: Ring of Fire/Circle Merk.

Announcement: Carpex Dad's camping trip, hit Hermes up for info.

Prayers/Praises:

MaCants daughter got her purple belt in martial arts, along with her studies under not the best conditions, quarentine and all that went with it. He told us her name, but I'm not going to try to spell it and potentially butcher it.

Our country

All the guys IR'ing it, hurt, and working to get back in the Gloom.

Callahan took us out, socially distant.

NMS: I do better getting back into the Gloom under accountability. it's too easy to let the fartsack keep you in it's grasp.

Quick message at the top of the deck: I changed everything about this Q when protests and all started. Look over at the sunrise, look at DTC, there is a LOT of beauty in the world, just need to see it sometimes.

Always nice to start the morning with HIMs to push. Push themselves, push each other, push for change in the individual.

PAX list not in alphabetical order, Yoast SEO deal right on top of it.

MIAGD!
