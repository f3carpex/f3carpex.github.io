No FNG's, Disclaimer

2 HIMs rolled in late so we did 5 Burpees OYO

Pledge

Mosey to the field parking lot for warm-ups

- Good Mornings, SSH, Merkins, Calf Stretches

THE THANG: DECK OF CARDS- We split into partners so we could divide on the track. Two groups split on opposite side of track. Split track and deck of cards in 4 sections

- Each PAX would pull a card at each station and call the exercise

- Clubs: Core exercise of choice
- Hearts: Burpees (somebody duplicated the A and J so we did extras of those)
- Spade: Leg exercise of choice
- Diamond: Merkin exercise of choice

I think we go about 1/2 way through the deck before we had to head back... but we ran about 2.5 miles total. We lined up for Indian Run back to flag.

Back at the flag we did some Boat/ Canoe's and then Have a Nice Day

Count-a-rama, Name-a-rama, Prayer
