This was YHC’s second Q ever and first time keeping the site flag safe (thanks for trusting me Red Ryder)!  This was my birthday Q and turned 40 on 12/22.  Good times.  It was a beautiful morning and was quickly called out by the PAX that I overdressed.  I should really check the weather each morning.  Wearing my wife’s watch again, the time was 5:45am, a quick disclaimer for the 3 FNGs, Pledge of Allegiance, and off we run…
