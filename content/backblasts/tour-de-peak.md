Here's what we did at Dante's Peak on Friday, November 6. YHC picked up the Q from Headroom after he posted that he needed to drop it the night before. Pet Sounds and YHC for some EC pullups and running before the ME.

## Warm Up

Pledge of Allegiance at the flag. Then mosey to the back side of the park - bear crawling the bridge along the way. Finish warming up with SSHs, Steve Earles, Moroccan Night Clubs, CF Merkins, Runner's stretch and calf stretch

## Thang 1

Partner up, mosey to the amphitheatre area. Partner 1 assumes balls to the wall position, while Partner 2 goes to the wall and does 20 Erkins. Switch up, and complete this again for Derkins and Dips

## Thang 2

Mosey to the pond loop rock pile. Partner 1 picks a non-traveling rock, and completes sets of 10 of curls, overhead presses, and squats. Partner 2 runs a lap, stopping at the pullup bars for 1 set up to 10 reps. Each partner gets 4 rounds.

## Thang 3

Mosey to the back entrance to the park. Pearls on a string back to the flag, stopping at every other street light. YHC lets Track Star call exercises twice, and one time was Superman Bananas. YW4ML.

## Mary

Heels to Heaven up to 30, Have a Nice Day

## COT

17 total HIMs, including a handful of respects. Announcements included the Whetstone program and MFR4SPBU. Probably other stuff. We prayed for Smither's stepfather, and YHC took us out.

## NMS

- This workout was meant to hit several different areas of a very diverse park space which is Apex Nature Park.
- Chicken Little was not present. However, he was missed.
- Tang is a bit of a talker
- Good crowd, a mix of old-timers and new guys. Good to see Robin Hood sticking with it!
- Be a little better today than you were yesterday. Tomorrow, do that again. And the next day. And the next...
