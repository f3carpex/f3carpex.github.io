Balmy 34 at Koka Booth at 0515.

Cauliflower and Squatter for the impressive 0445 EC.

12 Pax for my second attempt at a gangster rap strength workout. No one was clamoring for this the first time around, but it was so famously interrupted that I wanted another chance to stick the landing.

Mosey half-way to the rock pile. Quick warm-up. Mosey all the way to the rock pile. Choose a non-traveling rock.

Thing = Ten, 30-second strength exercises:

- Overhead press
- Goblet squat
- Push up to Side plank
- Bicep Curl
- Half burpee
- Squat kick
- Tricep pushup (Shut-In informs this is a ranger merkin)
- Knee lift to rock
- Squat to overhead press
- Diverbomber pushup

Repeato x5

Mosey back to flag. Quick Mary.

**Announcements**: Carying Place on Sunday at 2 (HC as early as possible), Freed to Bleed on May 1, Q at BiB to enter drawing for shirt.

**Prayers/praises**: Oofta's M with a milestone bday.

I take us out. First Carpex prayer that mentions Snoop Dogg?

**NMS**

I know I need a real bluetooth speaker.

No punches were thrown. Thanks for letting me get this out of my system.

Shut-In kind of shaded my rap choices, though, so maybe I need to do this again **but even harder**.
