Twas Friday evening when I got the Tweet from Hello Kitty inquiring about the next mornings Phoenix Q. To which I replied "looks like the site Q" Without any hesitation he steps up to lend a hand or two. That's what it's all about guys. Seeing a need and putting yourself out there. Mississippi had also texted me that he would be back in town after being absent for a month so that was awesome news! Franklin chided me about not being at SNS to run for the past 2 weeks after asking him where the heck he'd been. What goes around comes around but I need it and it will make me think twice before going back to the fart sack after cutting off that morning alarm.  We also had an FNG Morning Show who just happens to be biologically related to WKRP, Side note I wanted to name him Dr Johnny Fever but you can't win them all. Mr Biggstuff from Rockhill SC was in town and join in on the fun and thrills!
