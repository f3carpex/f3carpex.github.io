I was lucky enough to be able secure the highly coveted Q for Apex's new 45 Min AO: Off the Rails -- wanting to align the workout with the site name I didn't want to spend too much time planning. Here's what we did:

With 6 Pax at the flag we said the pledge and then mosey'd along the trail out behind the baseball field to a nice grassy opening I had spotted along a little EC.

## Warmup

- Imperial walkers
- Windmills 
- Sf arm circle 
- Good morning 
- Runner stretch

_On the conclusion of the 50 Imperial walker cadence count YHC Called "relax" hence the BB title - We were officially Off the Rails_

## Thang 1: 11s in the small ball field parking lot

- Burpees at the far end
- Squats at the near end

_Kitty ditched us some where in here to go meet up with the Das Booters_

## Thang 2: Angels in the outfield variations

1. Backwards run to the fence 💪 Peoples Chair at the Fence 💪 Sprint to the infield
2. Bear crawl to the fence 💪 Peoples Chair at the Fence 💪 Sprint to the infield
3. Karaoke Right to the fence 💪 Peoples Chair at the Fence 💪 Sprint to the infield
4. Karaoke Left to the fence 💪 Peoples Chair at the Fence 💪 Sprint to the infield
5. Crab walk to the fence 💪 Peoples Chair at the Fence 💪 Sprint to the infield

## Mary

I decided to make use of the nice turf and open space on the field instead of closer to the flag -- it was at this point we received some heckling form the _Das Booters_

- Dying cockroaches
- Freddie Mercuries
- Superman's
- Control Freak Homer to Marge

## Indigenous Peoples Run back to the flag

## Failed attempt at Never Have I Ever

Trying to kill the last ~ 2 min the pax rotated through with Side Straddle Hops, Merkins and finally Have a Nice Day whilst listing the AO's each had never posted
