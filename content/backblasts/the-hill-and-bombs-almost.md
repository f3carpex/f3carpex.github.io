7 Pax chatted a bit and welcomed Gambler from Asheville who was in town for a conference and then at 5:45 we were off.

Warm up jog  to Chanticleer's. 20 SSH, 15 GM, 16 IW

Then Johnny Cash around the circle. Holding plank everyone took turns doing the exercise. 10 merkins, 10 shoulder taps, 10 mountain climbers

**Off to the Hill**

Sprint/jog up and down the big Cary Parkway Hill alternating at the light poles

Partner up and do "Catch Me If You Can" up the hill. P1 - run backwards, P2 - 5 burpess and sprint to catch P1 then switch

Slowish jog back to the park

**B.O.M.B.S**

P1 runs through the concrete balls and the loop while P2 does the exercises 50, 100, 150, 200, 250. Audible called to change to BBSUs to LBSs and then to finish on time.

**Announcements**

**Prayer Requests**

Blue N Out - Baby boy coming July! Alos, for Leesville High Schooler

It was great to have Gambler with us!

Thanks guys for running the hill with me. The backwards run was probably the hardest.
