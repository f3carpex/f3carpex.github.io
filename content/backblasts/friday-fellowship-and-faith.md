17 Pax were out and ready for a solid beatdown.

Partially true. Their _were_ 17 pax there. But what started out as a fitness test quickly turned into a fellowship-pace-fitness-test-cluster. But that's what F3 is about. It's more than a workout and sometimes the workout is secondary to just being out there in the gloom with your bros. We got in a great beatdown, thanks to **[Callahan's 3yr old "fitness test" he created](https://f3carpex.com/2016/08/31/danger-zone-fitness-test-pre-blast/)** but most of all we just had fun.

- Banjo and Snooze killed it
- YHC said to bring gloves, but forgot his.
- Bear crawling a soggy DZ bridge is near impossible...ESPECIALLY TWICE EVERY LAP - Callahan...
- Puck and Viking were not there.
- Press On found YHC's workout wedding band and surprised everyone and 'popped the question' to me at COT! #hesaidyes!
- YHC takes full responsibility for it turning cluster test so fast. We had zero time to preview the figure out course. Not sure how we did it 3 years ago.
- All times and performances were negated. It just wasn't the right kind of day for it.
- YHC had breakfast with Callahan Thursday. Friday morning the dude is completely unable to talk. No idea how that hit him so fast!
- McCants was there and giving his normal lip. Good to have ya back bro.
- CD was giving me lip too. What's that about. He's too nice for it to sting.
- Goose kept doing all the wrong exercises.
- Don't interrupt Smokey in COT. Just don't.
- We finished late. COT went long. But it's summer! Saban don't care in the summer!
- Kitty closed us in prayer

Eye!  
Shut-In
