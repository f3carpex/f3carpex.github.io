God Bless Yoga Mat for many reasons, but two stand out:

1. He writes the best got danged pre-blasts and Q-hypes in the biznass.
2. If the Q spot is open, he makes sure the Pax know, and thus YHC was able to jump on it for this week, and pumped to do so, two boots.

The pax assembled, 18 deep with unseasonably warm temps... dang near 62 degrees when I tell that gurl please.

A top-notch F3 mission statement and we're off.

Warm-up:

- Super lap to the other lot and back to the flag for: GM, SSH, AC, Hallelujahs and Michael Phelps

The Thang:

- Get a partner
- With your partner at your side do 10 burpees and run over to the rock pile where each of you does 10 curls.
- Do that 5 times through, always 10 burpees but the rocks would add triceps, shoulder, row and a final round of curls.
- A quick plank circle to hear how a few pax (3 by my count) got their F3 names
- Move the pax over to Cary Parkway... we gotta get on that hill.
- A lap up and down stopping at every light pole for ascending merkins, up to 10 and then back down to 1. We picked up the six at the end.
- Mosey back over to the rock pile for another round of rock work w/ squats and stuff woven in.
- Back to the b-ball court for some Mary.

COT: 18, YHC took us out

NMS:

- Trunk coffee comes with real nice (please say in Cousin Eddy voice) mugs
- Speaking of mugs, Always Read the Muggo
- Love you guys, honored to lead.
- MIAGD!
