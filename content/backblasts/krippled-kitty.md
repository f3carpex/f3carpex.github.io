Hello Kitty busted up his ankle pretty good at F3 Dads last weekend, and after a few days in a walking boot was ready to get back in the gloom. That's why we have Bruisers, so instead of fartsacking and sadclowning, the injured PAX can continue to get after with their brothers.

**Warm-Up**

Stroll from the flag to the bank while doing imperial walkers, Sir Fazios, merkins and mountain climbers along the way.

Did you think a walking boot was going to keep Hello Kitty out of the gloom? Nah, son!

For a guy who complains so much about bear crawls Term Paper sure can crush them.

Both BO site Q's were bruising today.

Always enjoy being out there with my boys, thank you for letting me lead.
