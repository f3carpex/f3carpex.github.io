As mentioned above, today marks my one year anniversary of Kryptonite and joining F3.  I will save my sappy BB for tomorrow on my actual anniversary.  Pretty much did the same workout from a year ago, thanks Shutty!  Below is Shutty's back blast, with my edits.  See strikethroughs and words in Italics.

–  **1 group run around the median while the other group holds a rock over their head.**  Each lap do CDD for the sum total of the guys still holding rocks over their heads.  Stop at 5 total laps if the guys are too strong and won’t quit.  #Flapjack –   Same thing next lap set but with burpees.  #Flapjack _Pretty much the same, except we threw back the rock.  Inserted AMRAP merkins for Rock_

–  **Next we tried a partner suicide** thing that isn’t worth repeating.  It sounded better in my head and I didn’t explain it right.  #ClusterQ

– Run out of the parking lot to the right and cross over to the business parking lot.  There is a bit of a hill here.  Perfect for 7s. _**HALF’s HILL!!!!**_

–  7s always facing the same direction:  Meaning run backwards up the hill, Crapjacks _BurtJacks_ at the top, Merkins at the bottom.  Oldies_MostFit_ in 1 group, Youngies _DadBods_ in the other to make room for everyone.

_Once 7’s were complete, PAX assembled shoulder to shoulder for Grizzly Bear Crawls.  PAX bear crawl until you hear the Q say “Grizzly”.  Upon announcement, one burpee is performed, then back to bear crawling.  Not sure how many or how long, I could not see through the sweat._

I_ndian run back to the cars, only after Yogi gave us an excellent lesson in how to properly perform and Indian Run.  Thank you for the Co Q!…_LATE AGAIN!!  Sheesh…

Great work by all.  Welcome FNG Half who found us via his M reading resumes with F3 showing up under “Leadership Qualities” left and right!
