With all the training for the BRR, I need more bootcamp in my life. The pythons are looking a little sickly (not in the good millenial phrasing way) and I may be a little loose in the cage. This week has been all about more balanced workout - and less miles. So when the chance to Q arguably the greatest AO location in all of Carpex popped up, I jumped all over it and decided to deliver an OG style bootcamp. No newfangled parking deck running, no fancy parks or libraries, no EC, just an old-fashioned bootcamp workout. Here's what we did:

## The Warm-Up

Jog up the parking lot, around the church, and up Chatham to the best warm-up spot in all of Carpex in front of the Fidelity Bank. I could do without those insanely bright lights though. Along the way, @sammyboilermakr told us he'd like to run the BRR, but he'll be picky about who he runs with. That leaves YHC out of the running. At the bank:

- Merkins IC (of course) - there was wussie talk from those wearing hand panties
- GMs ICish
- SSH IC

## The Thangs

Thang 1: From the warm-up spot, pair up for a half Dora. Alternating runs around the bank while partner does exercises until as a team you've done 50 box jumps, 100 derkins, and 150 dips. OTP runners be complaining about the upper body work.

Thang 2: Follow me to Harrison to the rip rap pile, form into teams of 3, and grab a sizeable rock per team. Follow me over to the Baptist Church parking lot. 2 members of each team run up to the portico and do Mary exercises together while partner with the rock does 15 merkins, then runs up to the portico with the rock. P2 runs back down to the parking lot entrance does 15 merkins and brings the rock back to P3 who repeats the sequence. Do that until every partner has done that twice, then jog back do the rip rap pile and put your rocks back.

Thang 3: Follow me to the corner of Chatham and Academy. Lunge walk across Academy while the six trickles in. Next up: rack em stack em at the street lamps. Run 2 street lamps, do 2 merkins, run back 1 street lamp and do a Turkish get-up. Increase by 2 each subsequent round. I think we got up to 12 merkins and 11 turkish get-ups before time became our enemy.

Thang 4: Jog back to the corner of Academy and Waldo for a Billy Run to the flag. We finished up at exactly 45 minutes. It's almost as if YHC has done this before.

## NMS

- Thanks for the opportunity to lead. It was my honor to be among such HIM.
- Even though co-site Q @burtcarpex wasn't in attendance, he did call me on my way to BO
- The Frank's Red Hot Bloody Mary is by far the most unique "Q gift" I've received. Had it been a PBR, YHC would have consumed it on the spot. The Bloody Mary will be consumed this weekend.
- It's great to see Kinky Boots out for the third time this week. His first post was just Monday. Fun fact: he used to crush 5Ks at at 7 min pace and run marathons. He'll be ready for the BRR next week
- If you don't like the brutally hot training required to run the BRR, consider joining YHC for the Smoky Mountain Relay in April.
- The mumblechatter game was strong this morning, more than I could keep up with. I love it and need that too. Not much MC on a long run while doing hill repeats.
- I love you all.
