# Rocking the Kettle Bells

Nothing fancy. Kinda vanilla but any vanilla workout with 80's rock music is all good.

YHC went back to the good old days of rock and pulled out 10 all time favorite songs so we could rock the bells at Hells Bells.

On the musical agenda were:

Journey - Wheel in the Sky Bob Seger - Night Moves (Mandatory for Disco Duck) Guns N Roses - Sweet Child of Mind Heart - Barracuda Ozzy - Crazy Train Boston - More than a feeling Queen - Fat Bottomed Girls ZZ Top - Gimme All Your Lovin'

With the music play list set, it was time to get to work.

PAX circled around the flag for a Pledge of Allegiance.  After a quick giving of thanks for our ability to get out in the gloom, It was time to go.

18 PAX with one FNG Gantt Chart.

Run around the parking lot to loosen up.

Standard warm up exercises.  Nothing fancy.  Just work to make us better

Hillbillies x 15

Good Morning

Standard Merkin \* 15

Plank Jacks \* 15

**Thang 1**

Mosey down to the shelter and pair up at eight different kettle bell stations. PAX 1 does the station exercise while PAX 2 runs the pickle.  It is a 90 second lap around the pickle and all of the running PAX start and end as a team.  We are stronger as a team.  PAX 1 working at the station for 90 seconds soon realized that 90 seconds is a long time with the kettle bell.

The Kettle Bell work out stations are:

Lawn Mower (left and right)

Lunges

Dead Lift

Overhead Presses

Swings

Triceps Extension

LBC

Squat

**Thang 2**

There was no Thang 2 as Thang 1 took a long time.

PAX family members going through tough times (Disco's M, Grease's Dad, Parker's Dad, Michelob's Daughter).

YHC took us out.

**NMS**

YHC received various comments that the mumble chatter was going to be heavy attempting to throw YHC off course.  YHC received a subsequent DM post workout saying that due to the constant movement, the PAX didn't have adequate opportunity for mumble chatter distractions.  #MissionAccomplished

Leading a workout vs being led on a workout is such a change of perspective.  The Q-drenaline rush is real and YHC is happy that new Q's will experience it this October during VQ week.  F3 is a great group that not only develops PAX physically but mentally as well as providing a good helping of leadership training.  So thankful to be able to lead these fine men this morning.
