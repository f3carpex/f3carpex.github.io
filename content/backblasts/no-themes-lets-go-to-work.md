# No Themes - Let's Go To Work

With all of the themed workouts going on lately, YHC wanted to get back to basics.

PAX circled around the flag for a Pledge of Allegiance.  The PAX were then directed to look up at the cross on top of the Sovereign Grace Church.  This vantage point is humbling and serves as a reminder to the price Christ paid for us.  We are truly blessed to be able to do what we do.  The PAX were reminded to not take this ability for granted and in that vein, it was time to take these bodies we are blessed with and Go To Work to make them stronger.

16 PAX with no FNGs.

7 Respects

2 Hates

Final shout out to Brother Yogi for starting Tortouse almost two years ago by himself.  And look at him now.  He just completed his first marathon.  Way to go Yogi!

YHC got a Slack DM asking what Waffle House we were going to in place of the workout.  YHC responded that was the old Crimson.  That Crimson no longer exist.

Red Ryder shared an experience he had yesterday with a co worker where he was able to have a very positive impact on this person.  This embodies the F3 spirit of being a light to those around us.

YHC gave a shout out to Intimidator for his words yesterday at FMJ.  Don't count the minutes, make the minutes count. We all can have a positive influence on those around us with our words and not even know it.

Truly an honor to lead these fine men this morning.
