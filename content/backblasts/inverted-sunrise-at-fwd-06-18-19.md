YHC is honored to Q this morning at my old stomping grounds. It is good to be back.

Chipper, Jiggly Puff and YHC followed Oofta's lead on a 3ish mile EC run launching at 4:55. It looked like a couple others got in a shorter EC run.

Circle up, disclaimer, moment of silence for Warchild.  
The Warmup: Follow me, jog around the pickle, some Good Mornings, Windmills, Sir Farzio Arm Circles and SSH for good measure. Jog to the bridge stopping along the way for some Squats.

The Thang: Jog to the center of the bridge, BTTW facing the beautiful sunrise till failure. Alternating arms to promote earlier failure. Once you have failed, jog back to beginning of the bridge for some Mary.  
\- Repeato  
The Thang 2: 5's on the bottom/top of the esses on the other side of the bridge. In Hi-Liter fashion lets do burpees at the top and at the bottom. Run back to the center of the bridge for another round of BTTW till failure and some more mary.  
The Thang 3: Partner up and do 3 sets of 10 partner assisted pull-ups on the bridge. Audible to 2 sets, the Q cant do it, and if you cant do it, dont Q it. Run back to the rock pile.  
The Thang 4: do some rock work with some pretty pitiful delivery of the associated dad jokes while Q was calling cadence. I guess thanks for the marginally adequate effort on the joke delivery guys.  
The Thang 5: jog back to the flag, next exercise is the Have a Nice Day.  
  
Count-a-rama - 19. Name-a-rama - some young, some old, some meh.
