Beautiful crisp morning. YHC always trying to mix it up a bit and try new things and working to incorporate more stretching and mobility to keep me of the IR . Most of the Warmama was using PVC Pipes to get upper body loose for the Merkins and Pull Ups that awaited the PAX. Some liked it, some looked confused.
