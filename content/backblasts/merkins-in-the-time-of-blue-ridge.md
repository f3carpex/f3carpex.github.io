I have never seen "Love in the time of cholera". Now there is "Love in the time of Corona". Haven't seen that either. But Friday at DP, we had something better. Arm work in the time of run-heavy Qs.

But as with many workouts nowadays, this one started the night before with mindgames from Headroom.

> EC at 5am tomorrow. Letâ€™s get in some miles!!!
> 
> Headroom... circa 8pm

Sure, sounds good. HC.

> Shooting for a 445 start time.
> 
> Headroom... about 30 minutes later.

WHOA! Bait and switch. Nah, I'm out. Between the 25 minute drive, the unpredictable morning routing and a 445 start time, we're talking earlier than Maynard. PASS.

Showed up at 5 for what passes for reasonable EC in CARPEX. See Headroom.

> Been here since 430. Got up early I guess.
> 
> Headroom... in response to what time he showed.

The man is crazy. Build-a-Bear got to him. He's a lost cause.

#### Warm-up

Circle up around the flag. See two stragglers making the least amount of effort to get in position on time. 5:45AM so let's start with the pledge. Mosey to meet the stragglers. Two sets of five penalty burpees as a reward. I mean, we are almost to SouthWake but not quite. Have to keep some semblance of order here.

SSH, Sir Fazio/Clap/Michael Phelps routine, Mountain Climbers (no repeat of Thursday's fiasco) and some merkins.

Mosey into the bowels of DP

#### Thangs

Partner up for a DORA with 100 merkins / 200 squats / 300 Freddy Mercs. Start with rounds around the pond... switch it up to repeats up the hill to the shelter.

Mosey to the shelter for flap-jack BTTW with a Irkin-Dirkin-Dip set. Start with 10 each, then flip. Next round 7 each. Final round 5 each. The BTTW were a favorite.

Step out of the shelf for fresh air. Mosey to "bear crawl bridge". Gorilla hops to the top in pairs.

Mosey to one of the tennis courts. Ladder set with 10-15-20-15-10 merkins at the baseline-midcourt-net-midcourt-baseline. The last two sets were less than perfect form.

#### Mary

My standard set of LBCs, H2M, L/R heel touches and oblique crunch sets. ~20-25 each.

#### COT:

18

Prayers for Parker and Horatio and their fathers

Announcement about TCP on Sunday and the fundraiser that ended last night.

#### NMS:

Happy to finally have Schlitz at one of my Qs. Can't wait for the BRR to get to know some of the POGL crowd a lot better.

Fun crew at DP this morning. Big group. The parking situation is not bad at all now that we've figured out Apex BBQ Road is quite broad.

Thanks to Headroom for the hill repeats and EC run. Looking forward to more Sunday in Uwharrie.

Coffeeteria was a good time. Squirts of all sorts were discussed. As was Max Headroom. A bit of an unfortunate gaff (read: really fucked it up) on my part when I assumed LC was so much older than me due to a combination of bad assumptions. I owe the man several coffees. I hope he both forgives me and actually takes me up on it.

We tried to EH a dude in town from Sarasota, FL. Let's see.

Missing a few dudes. Need to get down here more often.
