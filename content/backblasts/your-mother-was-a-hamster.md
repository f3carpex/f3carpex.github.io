..and your father smelt of elderberries!

Practice makes...better.

So four days into this Q-stravaganza and YHC is still hanging on.  Uncharted territory folks.  Fortunately (for me) this came during Q swap week, so attendance has been maybe a little bit down in these other AOs compared to what it could be.  (Read: less cats to herd).  Whatever, I've enjoyed my time with all of you.  Some of you were subjected to multiple days of YHC, and for that, I'm sorry.

Track record so far this week:

- Kryptonite: 3 minutes late to finish (but we covered a lot of ground, in the snow/ice, uphil both ways!)
- FOD: ended on time, but came in 0.03 miles shy of 2 miles.  My goal is usually 2 miles covered.
- SNS:  Well, almost got it.  Came in hot with no time for COT, 6:31.  Q Fail.

Fourth time's the charm hopefully.

YHC joined Ma Bell, PBX, and Sky Blue for some EC running in (and even a little more EC...thanks Google Maps), complete with TWO shovelflags.  A brisk pace and we were there in no time.  Arrived with a few minutes to spare.  Site debriefing with the site Q on the way in, valuable intel.  We determined there were limited spots for pullups, saving the PAX from the planned Murph for the day. I keed, I keed.

**Warmup**

YHC's legs were already nice and warm after the 2 mile EC in, finishing up with "Andy" Hill.  But, we moved on regardless.  Lap around the pickle with some Hi, Knees mixed in.  Regrouped at the shovelflags for

- Pledge of Allegiance, IC

Shift the circle over there for:

- SSH x 15 (surprised the PAX!)
- Hillbilly x 15
- GM x 15
- Cottonpicker x 15

Off to the main event

**Main Event**

There we were on the finest turf in Northwest Cary on a Thursday morning at 5:45 with 9 people, so what else could we do but a Merkin Wave and Four Corners.

- Circle up in the hub, in plank position.
- Hold it as each PAX did one Merkin, followed by the next, etc. all the way around.  We got to 10.

Then, as a PAX, 3 Wolverines in the hub, then fan out to the corners (returning for 3 Wolverines between each corner, and at the end:

- Corner 1 - jump squats x 10 IC
- Corner 2 - Makhtar N'Diayes x 10 IC
- Corner 3 - Plank Jacks x 10 IC
- Corner 4 - CDDs x 10 IC

Doing the math, that's another 55 Merkins (75 if you count the IC CDDs, which I do).

Moving on to the next spot, the elementary schoolyard, in search of pull-up bars.  Found 'em!

Countarama and Namearama contained three different languages, but the out-RA-geous French accents took the cake.
