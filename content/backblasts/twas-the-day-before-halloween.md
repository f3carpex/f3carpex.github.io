- And all through the park
- creatures were stirring and leaving their mark.
- "Has there ever been a rhyming backblast?" He said with a grin.
- All those laps on the field made my head spin.
- It was dark, cold and wet!
- and somewhere Frisco was thinking "what else can I drink for a bet?"
- We got up, got dressed and then had a good morning,
- then took towards the summit without proper warning.
- Half way up I was regretting drinking that slurpee,
- and I saw Highlighter daydreaming about hitting a three-hundreth burpee.
- Biner sailed past in his bullet proof vest,
- seeing his smile is always the best.
- Once we reached the top of the hill,
- Sooey decided to lead us in a fine windmill.
- Everything was going according to plan,
- Sooey, what cadence! Were you in a band?
- Good mornings came and then a loud sound like an old door breaking a bone,
- twas Crimson stuck at the bottom and performing his morning groan.
- Then to the field as we were expertly led,
- four corners and burpees, aw come on can we do squats instead?
- After two laps my fingers were frozen,
- a lap or two sprint, then to lead I was chosen.
- A short mozy down to the tables shaking our hips,
- ten, fifteen, no, twenty durkins, erkins and dips.
- After round two when we were good and sore
- we went off for some Dora, was it actually Dora? I'm not sure.
- Then after some laps, merkins, squats and world war twos
- we sprinted some laps testing our shoes.
- With hands on knees we were almost defeated
- but with strength from Sky Blue, Doogie and Trike, we repeated.
- A few burpees more and we made it to Mary,
- I never knew a boat or canoe could be scary.
- Our dying cockroachs squirmed and our supermen flew
- and together we did more than we knew we could do!
