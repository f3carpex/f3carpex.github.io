I don't know what's going on with the weather this week. It's spring, but it's snowing. The weatherman says it's one temperature, the thermometer in my car says it's another temperature, and while I'm standing there waiting for the clock to tick 5:45 it feels colder than either of them. One FNG, disclaimer is given, let's get the blood moving and warm these boys up.

**Warm-Up**

Mosey over to the end of the parking lot and circle up for side straddle hops, imperial walkers, Sir Fazios both ways, plank jacks and merkins (morning, Ma Bell!)

**The Thang**

Mosey up the Big Hill and stop at the top for some very quiet squat jumps. Seems Monkey Nut's neighbors have complained about the noise, and we don't want to get him in trouble.

Mosey down the other side of the hill to the park entrance and line up for sevens. Burpees at the next light pole, star jumps back at the entrance. Thanks to Parker for leading the quick group in plank-a-rama while the rest of us finished up.

Mosey over to the rock pile via Bear Crawl Bridge.

Partner up for Dora 1-1-1-1-1, one partner runs around the pond while the other knocks out 100 tricep extensions, 100 overhead presses, 100 curls, 100 rock rows and 100 rock squats.

Mosey back to the flag via the recently renamed Lunge Walk Bridge.

**Mary**

Circle up for Freddie Mercurys, one-legged Homer-to-Marge, American hammers, dying cock-a-roaches and one more thing. My birthday is next week, and what do I want? Burpees! Hugh Damright! Finish up with ten burpees OYO.

**COT**

**Count-a-rama**:  21 **Name-a-rama**:  4 RESPECTs, 17 meh, 0 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Praise for Hot Spot's brother Cold Spot's birthday coming up, praise for Red Ryder's mother going home from the hospital, continued prayers for my M Kelly **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**

Dante's Peak is definitely the best AO in Apex on a Friday morning. So many options, the hardest thing about Q'ing here is deciding which ones to choose. I could Q here every day for a week and not repeat anything.

Welcome FNG Bumblebee!

We did 31 burpees, that's one for each degree Fahrenheit.

We expected a clown car from South Wake but all we got was Skid Mark. He brought along the Breath Taker, which he was happy to hand off to Red Ryder.

Water Wings reminded me of the time we posted here at Dante's Peak about a year ago. I was struggling. I couldn't run more than ten feet without losing my breath. When the other guys were doing ten reps, I was doing five, just trying to save enough energy to make it back to the flag. What I also remember is how Water Wings treated me that day. He didn't leave me behind, he didn't put me down because I was doing less than him, he didn't get frustrated when he had to wait for me to catch up. He encouraged me, he made me feel welcome, he told me to keep pushing and keep coming out. And that's what I did, I kept pushing, I kept coming out, and one year later I'm leading a 2.5 mile workout filled with burpees and rocks and I don't feel like I'm going to pass out when I'm done.

So if you're struggling to get through these workouts, keep pushing, keep coming out. You will get better, you will get stronger, and however long it takes we'll be there with you. Iron sharpens iron.

Thank you for letting me lead this morning, it's my honor.
