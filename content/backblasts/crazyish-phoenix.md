Banjo hit the Pax with news of his trip to the IR and naturally YHC jumped on the chance to Q Carpex's premiere AO on a Saturday morning. And with the boys headed out for Crazy Train, we had to get a good beatdown in, in their honor as well.

Fellowship run at 0605 (sorry Chipper who had been waiting since 0545 chomping at the bit) and the rest of the Pax arrive on-time for a 0630 start.

20 head out with YHC and 4 stay back with Trip-W's for a limited run beatdown. Them boys had kettle bells, yikes!

**Down to Carpex stadium for warm-ups:**

- SSH in Caps cadence
- Mountain Climbers
- Imperial Walkers

**Thang 1:**

Over to the rock pile on the back side of New Hampshire. The attempt was to split the pax into 5 groups of 4 (numbers got a little screwy) but in a group we did:

1. Partner 1 run to the bottom (or the top) of the steps and back
2. Partner 2 amrap LBCs
3. Partner 3 amrap rock work
4. Partner 4 amprap hills -- everyone through a cycle 3 times

From there all up to the top of New Hampshire where Hi-Liter shares the story of Peter's faith and walking on water to meet Jesus. Thank you Hi-Liter for the on-the-spot fellowship and faith.

**Thang 2:**

Back to Carpex stadium and the men circle up for the 10, 9, 8...1 circle of pain for Merkins, Squats, LBCs, Lunges lead by a group of 4 HIM. Then take it back from 1-10 with another group of 4. Fully soaked and cooked after this, I think we did over 100 Turkish Get-ups in the process. Oh, and the we amrap'd burpees in Banjo's honor for 2 sets (0:30 and 0:15).

**Misc/Mary:**

Up the hill, mosey to the line, sprint to the flag where the group of 4 awaits us to wrap up with a few Mary exercises.

**COT:** 24 strong w/ announcements, prayers and praises to go around

**NMS:** Can you believe a group of guys chose to run 14 miles in this hot soup? HIMs through-and-through. It was an honor to lead you men in Banjo's absense. I think he would be proud of this beatdown. Go attack the day with an enthusiasm unknown to man.
