Back in 2016, I decided to go to the gym the week after Christmas. Be committed and show up BEFORE all those people that start in January. I was on a mission to be less chubby and more healthy. Spin class two days a week. That was the answer! But Lifetime didn't offer a morning class on Fridays at the Apex gym. Crimson had been pressuring nagging encouraging me to try his new workout group F3.

So, on the last Friday of January 2017 I took him up on his offer to join him. I needed a Friday workout after all right? Crimson said just be ready and I'll pick you up. I remember thinking 5:45 was SOOOOO early. And man, let me tell you, it was cold! We arrived at Dante's Peak in what felt like the middle of the night. Hotspot lead a great workout and the only thing I really remember was about busting my face on bear crawl bridge. Back then I could bear crawl about 5 feet.

Fast forward to 2020 and I woke up at 4:43, 2 minutes BEFORE my alarm. Had time to fold laundry and answer some work emails before Crimson arrived to pick me up. See, Crimson can drive. He has a car. And for "old time sake" he picked me up this morning. I did end up driving from the work out to coffeeteria. Something about EC running with Monkey Nut after the beat down and I needed to pick him up at the top of the hill. It is worth nothing, my beat down must have been too easy (just ask two factor) and who would have though that Crimsom would become a runner after all.

This morning we had a strong crowd of 31 come out to celebrate Sooey's anniversary. We had a strong showing from our West Cary contingent. See back in old days we only had two Tuesday morning workouts, FOD and FWD. FWD might as well be Wilmington so I became a regular at FOD and got to know the crew out there pretty well. I appreciate them coming out today (and all the PAX) to celebrate my milestone!

At 5:45, it was time for the disclaimer, pledge, and jog to warm up. I had a treat in store today, we ran the long way to the basketball court instead of stopping at our normal warm up circle.

#### Warm up

Some stuff. Nature boy was so talkative I forgot want we did. I'm sure it was some SSH, Sir Fazio Arm Circles, Good Mornings, etc. Standard stuff.

#### Thing 1

Bear crawl bridge, split into two three groups and mosey to the rock pile. Group one rock work, group too run to the bench and LBCs, group 3 five good pull ups. Repeato.

#### Thing 2

Run up the hill to the back parking lot for 7's with Merkins and Burpees. Some PAX decided to bail early with Nature Boy thinking I had relayed a message for the PAX. I had planned to Indian run back to the flag. But I'm slow on the burpees. AND I called it so I had to do it. It's ok, just felt bad the PAX didn't have an A+ Q from YHC.

With the PAX we had left out in the middle of nowhere, we divided up to Indian run back to the flag. Once at the flag, I decided to run some more, trying to hit 3 miles so we jogged out to the warm up circle and did a bill run back to flag.

#### Mary

We did some mary. I was beat. It was some American Hammers, Homer to Marge, etc.

#### Prayers

- Cataracts surgery recovery! Give him a shout and let you know you are thinking about him.
- Disco Duck's and his M in helping his Mother in Law.
- Red Ryder's M/Nerf's Mom - surgery today, speedy recovery

#### NMS

- Covered it pretty well above.
- Two Factor said my Q sucked. I can take feedback. Feedback is a gift.
- Disco Duck has a badass stache.
- Crimson is my reason I came out to F3. Who is out because of you!
