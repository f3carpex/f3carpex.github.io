The Green Mile is a great location to meet up in the gloom and workout. Though, with it being one of the longest, I felt it could be one of the more challenging bootcamps to lead, especially when the factor of heat is brought into the equation. So YHC considered it a great honor to come out and Q it, and one that I took very seriously. The weather started out very nice, and stayed nice really through the entire time!

11 pax gathered at the flag at 0600 hours. 4 pax ran off into the yonder and I was told at the end they covered roughly 8 miles. Nice! The other 7 were raring to go, so a minute or two later we recited the Pledge and were off and running!

_**Warm Up:**_

Run to the first set of stairs

- **Good Morning**
- **Daisy Pickers**

_**Thang 4 – Burpee Suicides**_

Pretty self explanatory. We used the islands in the specific area of the parking lot to do this routine. Increasing 1 **burpee** at each island of course. This one was got pretty rough near the end.

Divide into pairs. Group 1 stays at the wall, Group 2 runs to the benches, then switch.
