YHC had the flag and the Q for Rush Hour but did not anticipate how bad Raleigh traffic is at 5:00.  I roll-in to the AO 5 minutes late, AFTER A 50 MINUTE commute.  Needless to say, I was steamed and frustrated to be late.  Lucky for me, only PAX that posted was Captain Kirk.  Since it was just the two of us lucky souls on a beautiful afternoon in DTC, I convinced the Captain to step up and lead the work-out.  After a drive-by by Old Maid, mumbling something about crazy train pre-run, we head out toward downtown and pair up for:

## Warm Up

Side Straddle Hops

Imperial Walkers

Sir Fazio Arm Thingies

Windmills

Quick Feet

 

## The Thang

Ready to head into the heart of DTC, Q calls for some traveling exercises, burpee jack webs.  For those that don’t know, it is a one-count burpee, with a three-count squat.  We perform multiple stations of these great exercises, making our way toward the fountain and trying not to get run over by all these runners.

We finish our 10 count, 30 count traveling burpee exercises at the big fountain (high camp gladiator).  Well, Q thinks the fountain looks like a clock, so we head to the edge of the fountain and perform:

12:00  12 dips, urkins, and left-right step-up

9:00  9 urkins and left-right step-ups

6:00  6 dirkins, dips, and irkins

3:00  3 regular merkins, dips, and left-right step-ups

Done with the fountain (and our fellow gladiators), we head to the Arts Center where Captain wanted to make sure Gary was ok (you have to post at Rush-Hour to find-out what that means).  Not hearing any different, we perform a rail climb to the top and bunny hops down and around the steps.

Done with those exercises, it is time to leave Gary and head back to the flag.  And how better to get back than with more traveling jack webs, this time the Q calls for Captain Thor's. We were so inspiring with our Captain Thor's that a young couple joined us for two sets.  We finish in the grass field near flag and are done for this edition of Rush-Hour.
