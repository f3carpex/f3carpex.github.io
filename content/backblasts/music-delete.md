The best plans often go astray. Today was a lesson in adapting to a failure in my pre-blast: I planned Music, Merkins, and Mumblechatter.

Good on two of those. A recent Andriod 11 update rendered my usual music playing app useless. In hindsight I should have tested this the night before. Lesson learned.

The PAX were disappointed by the silence. I tried to figure out how to stretch the workout because I planned a nice, new thang to a song. I wasn't going to sing it, neither will the PAX. They'd cut it short because of the beatdown it would give. Next time!

PAX demanded that I start on time and stop fiddling with my phone.

OK, start with the Pledge of Allegiance, mosey to the side of the church then...

### Warm Up

- Good mornings (3 slow stretching ones)
- Side straddle hop x20
- Sir fazio arm circles 10 F 10 R
- Michael Phelps
- Merkins x10
- Mountain climbers x20
- Plank to Runner stretch L/R

Somewhere in the middle of this we noticed that Soverign Grace Church has been renamed to Cornerstone Fellowship Chruch. There's a new temporary sign out front - I expect the big permanent sign will be replaced soon.

### Thang 1

\- Burpees at the bottom, (6, 5, 4...)

### Announcements

Odyssey is Oct 24. Need 24 Q's for this! Pickles is taking SAG Wagon signups.  
YHC is going to bike and SAG Wagon / Serve as needed.

### Prayers

Apex HS Soccer coach Todd's sudden death - for family members and co-workers and the Apex community.

For parents with children at home- educating them and working their jobs, and the short time we have with our kids.

### NMS

As always it's a pleasure to start my day with HIMs - they were forgiving on the lack of music and happy with how challenging the Thangs were.

Mumblechatter with 6 PAX is heard by all and responded to by all!

_**This is where the playlist was going to be**_

I got a new music playing app installed and working 5 minutes after I got home. I'm ready for the new song at my next Q!
