I had a lot of fun planning this one and glad the PAX generally seemed to enjoy it. Things were moving quickly to try to keep up the pace of the playlist.

Great to meet Mayhem, who is the good friend of a co-worker friend of mine that posted twice about a year or so ago. I was never sure whether he was named The Quiz (another UNC academic scandal dig) or The Gwizz (Pack wrestler). He felt good about his original effort but then Bartman threw an epic beatdown on him at A Team and he was sore for a week. I am counting on Mayhem’s support to get him back out.

Rosalita has to be one of the best “get in a good mood songs” ever

It was funny to see Large coming in hot and on Fluoride’s tail. Fitting that we partnered them up.

Hello Kitty knows the “oldies”

Props to FNG 1099. He was a little late and probably was very confused about what was going as he had to pound out 42 merkins off the bat. But the man has a 1 month old! Congrats and hope to see you again soon.

Until yesterday, I had always assumed that AC/DC sang Balls to the Wall. Turns out it was some German band that I had never heard of that just sounds like AC/DC. Saban correctly pointed out that Big Balls would have been a great choice for that set.

This new wordpress takes a little getting used to, but in the long run, it will be nice.

Always an honor to lead this fine group of men.
