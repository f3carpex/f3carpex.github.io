**My name is Chicken Little and I began F3 on June 5th, 2019 with Banjo as the Q at Lion's Den. I feel that I was hooked almost immediately, after several other PAX that I'm friends with told me that I needed to come to F3. I was like, "yeah right, who begins to work out at 5:30 anyway?!" And then I remembered that I was fat... and realized that what I WAS doing was not working. What I needed was a peer group of other men who would keep and hold me accountable. After beginning F3, I found this support... and not only support for me... the opportunity to support and serve others. This day marks my VQ!**

At 5:29 am on this brisk morning, I yelled out 1 minute, which seemed to startle everyone and probably awoke several surrounding neighbors. Quick run through the F3 mission, no FNGs.. darn.. but still reminded all PAX to not injure themselves with the beat down I was about to deliver. Pledge of Allegiance and we were off for a brisk mosey over to the other side of the parking lot where there is a nice pickle.

Circle up, count-o-rama (because I needed to know how many PAX I was working with!

RECOVER!

We had just enough time to mosey over to the 540 bridge.. Run across, bear crawls back!

Mosey back to the flag. Cooled down with a few stretching exercises. Last exercise... HAVE A NICE DAY!

Real quick... I was late in getting this back blast out, but better late than never. Now, It's official that I completed my VQ!! This has been a challenging_,_ yet very exciting month for me and my family! Bought a house, cleaned/painted/landscaped (thanks to Hamm, 16 Steves, others)/de-cluttered/staged & prepped and listed our current house, backpacked 45 miles on the Appalachian Trail, moved out with kids and dogs for the weekend (thanks to 16 Steves and his M) for multiple showings last weekend and SOLD the house by Monday morning. Fitting my VQ into the week was challenging to say the least! I have to say that my support system was amazing. We did not do this alone, and without neighbors, friends, and family, we would have not been as successful. I would not be where I am right now without all of you. Thank you all for the example you set, your leadership, and your support! Aye?!
