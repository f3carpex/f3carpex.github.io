A Day Late, but here we are! 10 Phoenicians showed up in the 30Â° chill to do some work on a Saturday. Here's what we did:

Pledge with the 2 Bruisers, and then follow me! Around the home pickle and out the North Side to Maury O'Dell, grab the path to the Community Center lot, back through to Metro Park Dr and hang a right to convene at Warmup Intersection for 8CGM, SSH, SM/PJ/SM, IW.

Head east on Metro Park Dr stopping at every lightpole for 3 burpees. Gather up with some squats and continue the mosey to the east end pickle.

THANG 1 - 7s on the pickle with burpees at both ends. Stop halfway in both directions for 5 squats. Mosey the long way (stopping onces to Boathouse Square for

THANG 2 - Increasingly Decreasing Jacob's Four-Cornered Ladder with burpees at every corner. So that's 2, then 4-2, then 6-4-2, then 8-6-4-2. We did not take it to 10 (or 11 for that matter). More squats and then mosey to the New Hampshire rock pile, finding an icy kiosk along the way, for

THANG 3 - PAX-led rock exercises:  
Big Red called En Gardes (in both directions)  
Press On called Overhead Presses (to 11)  
Flip Flop called Rock Rows  
Ollie called Rock Your Bodies  
Ma Bell called Around the Worlds (in both directions)  
Pierogi called 6 Rock Burpees  
En Garde called Rock Swings, holding the last one  
Jiggz called a mosey back to the kiosk, stopped to ensure we wouldn't slip

7 burpees to get us to 125 for the day, and mosey up the hill and gather up for some more squats. Mosey back to the flag while debating the merits of sprinting at the end of a workout and rejoin the bruisers at 0730. THAT'S IT.

COR/NOR - 4 RESPECTS, 6 meh

Announcements - Freed to Bleed in 2 weeks

Prayers/Praises - En Garde job, Pierogi job, Burt recovering, etc

Theme was inspired by F3 St. Louis's Burpee January challenge. 100 burpees a day through the month of January to cumulatively garner 1M burpees. They got enough guys to do it, so it's just a matter of execution at this point!

I missed the St. Louis-Phoenix connection before sitting down to write this, which would have added a bit to the theme options... may bring something back there another time. Another reason to pre-blast / pre-write your backblast.

This was another relatively late commit to Q. That's been increasingly easy to do - I don't know if it's because it's January, or because of COVID, or because there are so many workouts. Any way you read it, we gotta tighten up. Or deal with my recycled Qs I guess (that's a preblast for 1/21 at T2I, FYI).

IIHC at coffee convergence with the TGM crew, TR was calling 21-rep sets for bruisers. May be injured, but still putting in WORK. What's the opposite of HC for whenever he pops up again. markcubanimout.gif

MIAGW, and SYITG.
