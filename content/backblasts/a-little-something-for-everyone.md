Ima be real honest here. DZ is not a site a frequent that often. It's a damn haul from my house in the POGL. But in 2020, YHC is gonna do better about getting to sites that are not in my normal rotation. And since we're being real here, that's a pretty good problem to have here in Carpex. This thing is BLOWING UP! So after I barely made my connecting flight, I arrived at North Cary park with plenty of time to spare. Then the cars started rolling in. YHC was already excited because there was the rumor of a Churham guy coming who was bringing an FNG. Also, Flip Flop posts here a lot and, well, he's Flip Flop. PIE-rogy got home early from his trip and was a HC.

At 5:41, still no flag in sight. Wondering if Raleigh had taken over the site, since flags are apparently optional there. No problem, then YHC could also get out of writing a backblast. But no worries, the aforementioned frequent-traveling site Q comes running in with flag in hand.

At 5:44, Burt and Coney come rolling in hot. Burt gets out of the car half-dressed mumbling something about no-shit January, or was it just no shit today? He claimed to have gotten out of bed at 5:31. OMG Becky! It's now 5:45, there are 21 dudes standing in a makeshift circle, so we probably need to get moving. The F3 mission is stated, and then (with multiple interruptions) YHC gives the disclaimer. FNG does not look worried.

## Warm Up

Two laps around the pickle, with some high knees, butt kickers, karaoke, and mumblechatter. Circle up for standard RR warmup including Pledge of Allegiance, SSHs, Sir Fazio arm circles, seal claps, Steve Earles, Plank Jacks, CF Merkins, and Good Mornings.

## The Thang

Start at the basketball courts. Complete 20 Merkins, 20 Jump Squats, and 20 LBCs. Run around the pickle TO THE RIGHT to the playground and complete 5 pullups. Then run back to the basketball court TO THE RIGHT, rinse and repeat for 5 rounds.

Same thing next, except the exercises are 20 CDDs, 20 Monkey Humpers, 20 Dying Cockroaches, and 5 pullups (of course).

## Mary

30 x American Hammers. Have a Nice Day.

## COT

21 total, a whole pile of Respects in the mix. Welcome FNG Baltic (Avenue)!

Remember the KKC sign-up. Keep praying for How How's family after the loss of his mother, as well as Kingsley as he recovers from surgery prior to starting his last round of chemo for NHL.

YHC took us out.
