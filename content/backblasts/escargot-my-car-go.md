I came across a news story Tuesday that the 2019 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame nominees had been announced. I don't remember how the news came to catch my attention but catch it it did. Start with the fact that two of my favorite bands were on the list (again) and that I hadn't even heard of a couple others and I got intrigued.

An hour or so later, not only had I created a little Spotify playlist to listen to at home, but an idea for a Q was developing as well.

Luckily there was an opportunity coming up the very next day to try things out.

Plan: create a playlist using one song from each artist and arrange the songs so as to create as much confusion and annoyance among the PAX as possible. Mitigate the annoyance somewhat by offering a prize to whoever could guess the theme of the playlist.

### Pre-Game / Disclaimer:

Drove up to SNS (after picking up Captain Kirk who alerted the #1stF channel of his desire for a pickup at the convenient hour of 3:23AM) with 7 minutes to spare to see 15 guys all milling around wondering what was in store. Time to start the mood: ["Autobahn" by Kraftwerk](https://youtu.be/x-G28iyPtz0).

PAX recognizing the song/artist? Zero.

### Warm-up:

Enough ahead-of-its-time German experimental techno. Jog to the parking lot by the baseball fields accompanied by ["Breaking the Law" by Judas Priest](https://youtu.be/L397TWLwrUU).

https://youtu.be/L397TWLwrUU

PAX recognizing the song/artist? Most.  
PAX wondering if the theme was Satan? At least one.

Circle up for a choreographed warm-up set to ["Higher Love" by Whitney Houston](https://youtu.be/dTYOkcRH220).

https://youtu.be/dTYOkcRH220

The PAX were not amused. GM, Sir Fazios, Overhead Claps, SSHs were done during the slow bits. Burpees carried us through the faster bits.

PAX recognizing the song/artist? Most.  
PAX thinking the theme was a progressively worse playlist? All.

Mosey to the big field accompanied by ["Black Hole Sun" from Soundgarden](https://youtu.be/3mbBbFH9fAg).

PAX recognizing the song/artist? Three by my count.

### Thang 1 (starts to drizzle)

Semi-circle up in the big field. You have 1 minute to complete each of the following. Rest as you can. After 1 minute, start the next set.

- 10 burpees
- 20 HRM
- 30 IC American Hammers
- 40 L/R Flutter Kicks

Cycle is 4 complete sets. We did 4 and 1/4 sets.

PAX amused: Two visibly (YHC was bouncin') but you know most everyone was getting jiggy with it.

PAX amused: Parker.

Many a comment of approval from the Sabre-Coney-Saban corner.

Many a comment of disapproval from the Sabre-Coney-Saban corner. Pet Sounds was pleased.

### Thang 2 (downright raining now)

Mosey to the big hill for a few repeats.

- Bear Crawl up, 10x Star Jumps, Crawl Bear Down, 10x Burpees
- Crawl Bear up... scratch that, Bear Crawl, 10x HRM, Crawl Bear Down, 10x Burpees
- Bear Crawl up, 10x Star Jumps, Crawl Bear Down, 10x HRM

We are now entering the Meh/Respect portion of the playlist. Plenty of music enjoyment coupled with lots of PAX thinking YHC is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.  
["Tell Me Something Good" by Rufus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cm_cFzVAoo8).  
["Bang a Gong" by T. Rex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVEhDrJzM8E).

Line-up to mosey back to the flag, surfing the wave on the way out of the field.  
"Hit Me With Your Best Shot" by Pat Benatar.

Bartman suggested a theme of albums recorded in Encino, CA. YHC is still trying to figure out if he might have been right by accident.

### Mary

As if by perfect planning, just as we're making our way back to the main parking lot, the last song of the morning comes on. "The Boys Are Back In Town" by Thin Lizzy.

https://youtu.be/SGZqDzb\_\_bw

And back we are for a bit of LBCs and stretching to satisfy the Maynard crew.

### COT

43 total PAX.

Announcements: Haven House raffle is Thursday @ Bond. Since it's also Shut-In's birthday, the shots are on him. Or off of him. Bring mouthwash.

Praises & Prayers: College applications and successful operations.

### NMS

- The plan was to create a sense of puzzlement and a bit of annoyance with this post. Little did I know that the most annoying thing I could have done was not call "Recover" between Sir Fazio's and Overhead Claps?! I mean... it was a hightempo warm up!
- What we did not get to:
    - "What a Fool Believes" by The Doobie Brothers
    - "Just Can't Get Enough" by Depeche Mode
    - "So Much to Say" by DMB
    - "Kick Out the Jams" by MC5
- Thanks to my wife for suggesting some of the order and especially pushing Biggie a bit higher up the list. Nice touch.
- Disco Duck would have won the prize (a four-pack of beer still sitting in my fridge) but he decided to walk instead. Sorry buddy...
