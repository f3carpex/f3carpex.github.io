The PAX didn't know they were posting for Hell's Bells 2.0 in the Gloom this morning, which made the surprise all the more worth it! Tin2Iron is a difficult workout to plan due to the no running rule. As a Q, you want a good, hard workout with plenty of sweat...so my choice for getting hearts pumping was a massive amount of kettle bell swings! Fun times were had, here's the workout:

**Thursday - 3 Sept - Tin 2 Iron- CORE**

**0530 - Welcome** - FNG disclaimer

**Announcements: Blood drive, Odyssey- q and sag needed, Tpc sawgrass- volunteers needed @1400**

**My forte is finding motivation and inspiration from the thoughts of great leaders, so I offered to share some words from a great leader from history, as will be a theme of mine as a Q:**

> “Leaders aren’t born, they are made. And they are made just like anything else, through hard work. And that’s the price we’ll have to pay to achieve that goal, or any goal.”
> 
> \-Vince Lombardi

**Prayer/Praises**\- WWW took us out.

**NMS**: The PAX worked hard and crushed this workout. I'm proud that I didn't see any of them modify, even after 250 kettle bell swings. Using the battle rope was fun, I also had hand sanitizer available since we were all using the same rope. I'm excited to use more of the toys and coupons at the AO for future Qs...I've got my eye on that tire, although I think Ausfahrt would prefer he curl up in the tube and have us push him down a hill than to do tire flips with that behemoth.
