28 HIMs showed up for my VQ and TCLAPS to Liverpool for the EC run (Hoping if I tired him out enough he would limit the MC he promised to deliver. Today I learned never to underestimate that man and his ability to talk)

0530 hit, disclaimer and we recited the pledge. Checked my weinke and it said mosey so we did.

**Warm-Up**

Ran the path along the railroad tracks - stopped at the batting cages and 5 burpees OYO - remember the batting cages

Continued on to Thales and circled up:15 SSH, IC

- "Sub"-out and Repeat 3x

**Thang 2** - Keep Your Partner

- Partner 2 - Balls to the Wall 10 Count/Worlds Worst Squat (Squat Jump, Sumo Squat, Regular Squat) 10 Count
- Flap Jack and Repeat 3x

**Thang 3**

- Feeling pretty good at this point - MC has actually subsided a bit at this point - must be doing something right
