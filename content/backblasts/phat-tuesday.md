22 brave men and 2 brave dogs assembled in beautiful downtown Cary on the most glorious evening of the year.

**Warm-Up** Mosey around the parking lot in front of Page Walker, past the pocket park, to the parking lot next to the tracks and circle up for various warm-up exercises. I think one of them was burpees.

**The Thang** Mosey safely across the street to the little hill behind the Chamber of Commerce for 7&7. At the top 7 **P**eeping lipsticks, at the bottom 7 **H**and-release merkins, for 7 rounds.

Mosely safely back to the flag for more 7&7. At the sidewalk 7 **A**ustralian pull-ups, lap around the lot to the pocket park for 7 **T**wo-step step-ups, for 7 rounds.

**Mary** Circle up in the pocket park for burpees.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  22 **Name-a-rama**:  6 RESPECT, 16 meh, 2 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Praises for Short Circuit returning to the gloom after catching Covid, prayers for Bartman's family and Crimson's family after losing loved ones **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**  22 at Rush Hour is the new record. I don't expect it to last long, Cauliflower and VHC are crushing it as site Qs, we're about to hit that spring time weather, and all of our numbers are about to explode.

Carpex hit 115 pax yesterday. It's our fourth day over 100 in February, and we're pretty sure it's our biggest day since our anniversary a couple of years ago.

Welcome FND Mrs Doubtfire. We don't usually allow females at F3, but I guess it's OK if she's on a leash.

Theismann showed up in khakis. I didn't slow him down one bit.

Thanks to Press On for providing post workout refreshments.

If you're not familiar with the Peeping Lipstick, here's the description from the Exicon. A combination of a Turkish Getup and Star Jump. PAX performs the Turkish Getup and then immediately performs 1 Star Jump. The transition between TG and SJ should be done fluidly. This exercise name comes from the combination of 2 PAX names, "Peeping Tom" (who loves Turkish Getups) and "Lipstick" (who loves Star Jumps), who were once working out together as Co-Qs and decided to combine the two movements. The name Turkish Getup Star Jumps is just way too long to say.

I can't tell you how happy I was to find this while searching for exercises that start with P and to have Tom there to give us the demonstration. But if you missed it you're out of luck, because I'm never calling them again, they are awful.

Love you guys!
