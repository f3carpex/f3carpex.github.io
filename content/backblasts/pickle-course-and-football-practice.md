VQ week "officially" started today...though some brothers started last week.  For my VQ, the challenge was on to keep up the Wolverine site tradition.  It was an early October morning.  75 degrees & very humid, but that didn't stop us.   23 PAX eager & ready to go.  Unaware of what was ahead, many showed to support me as VQ.  Butterflies...of course, make mistakes...probably, mumbled at?....most certainly.  5:30 - we started started off with the pledge and a jog around the park pickle - regular run, high knee, side shuffle, backwards, etc...now we're ready to run to Davis Dr MS.

**Warm Up**

**Thang 1**

Pickle course.  Bear crawl to nub in pickle, 10 merkins, run to top of pickle, 10 SSH, crab crawl to next nub, 10 crab cakes, run to bottom of pickle, 5 burpies.  Repeato by increasing merkin, SSH and crab cakes to 20.

**Thang 2**

Indian run back to flag.

**Thang 3**

From flag, we jogged to soccer field. I brought back a memory of a HS football drill.   All PAX lined up at one end of soccer field, we ran in place until I yelled "down".  On that, we dropped to our chest and sprang back up.  We repeated that until I yelled "sprint".  On that we sprinted to the opposite side of the field. We then repeated the cycle.

**Thang 4**

After the football drill, we jogged over to the shelter where we finished out with some dips and urkins.

**Mary**

I learned something...you dont need 10 minutes for Mary.  Did some american hammers, superman, box cutters, side planks, boat-canoe, merkins, etc. and finally finished with Have a Nice Day..
