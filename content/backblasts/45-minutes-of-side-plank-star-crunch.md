Well who is that barreling in at exactly 5:44 am to West Cary's best AO on a Thursday morning? It's Trike with the flag, of course. Nevermind he lives like 2 minutes away. No FNGs, the Pledge is pledged, the mission of F3 is recited, and off we go.

## Warm Up

2 laps around the parking lot, then circle up for SSHs, Moroccan Night Clubs, Steve Earles, Plank Jacks, and CF Merkins. Partner up, and mosey to the bus loop.

## The Thang

Partner 1 does AMRAP of the following: world's worst merkins, jump squats, and LBCs, while Partner 2 runs the pickle. Partners do 2 times for each exercise, for a total of 6 rounds each.

Mosey to the steps leading to the track for a set of 5s: Scorpion Dry Docks at the bottom, and Dying Cockroaches at the top.

Now mosey to the basketball court for the finale. Everyone bear crawl the length of the court, mosey back and BTTW for the six. Then one round of Flying Circus Shuffle, which is left-right lunge steps followed by a burpee, for the length of the court. Mosey back, BTTW until the 6 arrives.

PAX choice and finish up with Freddie Mercs

5 respects, 10 mehs

Reminder to connect intentionally with those around you, because you never know what someone might have going on. Prayers for Jonathan, one of those folks who you just didn't know was struggling.

YHC took us out.

## NMS

No side plank star crunches were done. NONE. Be a little better today than you were yesterday, and DBB!
