It was indeed a great day to get up and workout in the early morning gloom! It was also YHC’s first time of leading a high tempo beatdown. So I had been looking forward to that, as well as receiving an FMJ camo koozie at the end, I’m not gonna lie! So after everyone arrived and stretched out: the runners came in, YHC gave the disclaimer, led the Pledge, and we were off!

_**Warm Up:**_

Run toward the running track to do:

- **Good Mornings**
- **SSH**
- **Hillbilly**
- **Moroccan Night Clubs**
- **Mtn. Climbers**
- **Calf Stretches**

_**Thang 1:**_

Run onto the track where 4 (very small) cones were spaced equally around it. Run to first cone, do **Pickle Pounders.**

_**Thang 2:**_

**B.L.I.M.P.S.** **(Burpees, Lunges, Imperial Walkers, Merkins, Plank Jacks, Squats)** routine working our way around the track. For the _B_ we ran to the second cone from where we were (that would be the 3rd cone on the track), and did 5 **Burpees**. Then ran to the 3rd cone from where we were for letters _B_ and _L,_ 5 **Burpees** and 10 **Lunges**. We continued in this pattern of cone running, exercise letter building, and the increasing rep count for each exercise letter until several laps were completed and BLIMPS was finally spelled out.

_**Mary:**_

We took one more lap around the track, stopping at each cone to do a little ab work. As well as to retrieve said cones. At the cones we did:

- **LBCs**
- **Freddy Mercs**
- **Homer to Marge**
- **Supermans**
- **Low Slow Flutters**

Run back to the flag for little stretching.
