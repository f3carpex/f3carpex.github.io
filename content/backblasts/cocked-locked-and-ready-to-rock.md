## **Thang 1:**  

Kickstart My Heart - Motley Crue- Count off  Evens to the Right, Odds to the Left

- Evens to the school wall for BTW to failure or Odds catch up
- Odds to the Playground AMRAP Pullups then run to School wall to swap
- Repeat Twice
- Mozy to Circle between evens and odds

## **Thang 2:**  

Thunderstuck (Burpees) AC/DC - Burpees w/ low pulsing squat between

- Drop and do a Burpee every time you heard the word Thunder!  (lost count after 25…)
- Pulsing Squats cooked the legs so…
- Mozy across the street to the big parking lot

## **Thang 3:**

All My Life - Foo

- Broadjump back to start
- Mozy to Salem Pong Mtn

## **Thang 4:**

Bleed It Out - Lincoln Park

- Bear Crawl Merkin Mountain
- Facing same direction (always)
- 5x Merkins at top and both start and end, Bear Crawl in-between
    - Yeah this sucked big time
    - Audibled to 2x from 3x….
    - Thank Michelob for the idea a month ago...

## **Thang 5:**

Flower - Moby (Love me some Sally)

Merkins called by Song Caidence

- Sucked more than Merkin Mountain
- All form was tossed out the window, but the PAX gave every ounce of effort

## **Mary:**
