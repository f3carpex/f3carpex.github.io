'Twas a quiet, gloomy morning at Sovereign Grace Church. YHC arrived about 0515, just early enough for some EC stretching and pullups. There were moments it appeared this would be a post of 1 PAX. Alas, soon Hanson rumbled in and others joined.

First exercise, the Pledge of...no flag. No pledge.

### Warm Up

Mosey to the front lot for SSHs, Moroccan Night Clubs and Overhead claps. Mosey to the pull-up bars for 10 pull-ups each. Then mosey across 55 to the municipal buildings on Upchurch Street for Cotton Pickers, Steve Earles, Plank Jacks and Control Freak Merkins.

### Cemetery Hill Thang

Actually it's W Moore Street. We would partner up but instead split into 2 teams. Time for another edition of Burpback Mountain. Team 1 works on their 100 Burpees EACH while Team 2 backwards runs up to the first light, then fast mosey back. Flip flop until teams has completed their 100 Burpees EACH.

### Holleman Street Thang

Mosey to the intersection with Holleman. Complete 5s - World's Best Merkins at the bottom of the hill at the dead end, and Dying Cockroaches at the top. Once complete, mosey up Holleman to the Baptist Church parking lot for 20 Monkey Humpers. Continue mosey into downtown.

### Salem Street Thang

Mosey to the parking lot at the intersection with Center Street. Complete 20 WWIIs. Time to return, back through downtown, stopping at each stoplight from the Fire Station to Anna's, completing a burpee at each. Continued mosey while braving the traffic crossing at W Williams Street, head down Harwood to...

### Ignite Fitness Thang

Had to stop there - complete 5 burpees right in front of the entrance, and then bear crawl up the hill toward where our flag would be if there was a site Q present with a flag. Once back on site at Sovereign Grace, continue to the pull-up bars for the other end of our bookend - 10 pull-ups each. Back to the parking lot.

### Mary

Captain Thor up to 7 BBSU:28 Hammers, the clock ran out on us.

### COT

1 Hate, 4 Mehs

Announcements: SNS bread breaking this Wednesday

Prayers: Sooey, Ausfarht for continued recovery. Crimson and family as they face difficult decisions.

YHC took us out.

### NMS

- Big TCEPS to Hanson for taking initiative to get this thang going, and to get after it in the gloom with a bunch of old farts.
- YHC was a bit confused - this started out as a running AO and seems to have morphed into high tempo.
- Did I mention there was no flag present? TIGHTEN UP!
- Lots of hills and side streets near this AO - hit it up for a hi Tempo alternative to another AO on Mondays that will remain nameless.
