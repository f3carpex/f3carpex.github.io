When the request hit groupme for a Q for Dante's Peak YHC jumped at the opportunity to lead Carpex's finest HIMs not realizing that it was the morning after the big Christmas bash. Never fear, I knew I'd have a strong group of HIMs and I wasn't disappointed this morning. I was a bit worried at 5:37 when we only had YHC, Crimson (because you know he rode with me), and Disco Duck in the parking lot but we had a strong crowd roll in from there. I did appreciate Disco making the effort to come to my Q to ensure I had strong support.

I do have to admit I was kind of "winging it" this morning. I had the general idea that we were going to do a big loop around Apex Nature Park. Last night when browsing Facebook, I saw where my friend was with his family at Pullen Park riding the Christmas train and my theme was complete. The 11's where a nod to Earhart's Tortoise Q with the burpees from Phoenix last Saturday. Be glad I avoided bring back the Rockettes from last Saturday.

5:45 hit and we were off to the normal warm-up circle!

Warm Up:

- SSH x 15
- Imperial Walkers x 15
- Windmills x 10
- Mountain Climbers x 10
- Merkins x 10

Since the temperature was hovering around 32 I thought I would be good to get some running in to make sure we were all nice and warm. Up to the top of the hill for 5 burpees OYO then continue on to the main entrance for 5 more burpees OYO. Then form two lines for an Indian Run to the far parking lot for our first real pain station.

Thang 1:

- 11's with burpees and star jumps between the speed limit sign and the fire hydrant
- Some mary until everyone had finished

Continued our train ride down to the rock pile by the bridge.

Thang 2:

- Set of 10 x each 0 curls, overhead press, tricep extensions, and rock rows.
- Rotate 3 for some recovery time (and testing early morning counting skills)
- Repeato
- Rotate 4 just for fun
- Repeat

Continue our ride to the bridge back near the parking lot.

Thang 3:

- Race a partner bear crawl up the bridge with an extra does of dizziness.

Back to the flag for some mary.

Mary:

- Partner up, partner 1 start some mary. Partner 2 to the playground for 10 x pull ups. Flap jack.
- Next partner 2 off for Dips and flap jack.
- Rotate through 10 x step ups / flap jack and 10 x derkins / flap jack.
- Finish with some Disco lead dying cock roaches.

And it was 6:30 just like that!

Announcements:

- Christmas party - December 2018, see Rip for details
- South Wake CSAUP tomorrow

Prayers

- PAX's mom and results expected back today

NMS:

- Always a pleasure to lead such a great group of HIMs
- Crimson requested a beat down. If you're sore, blame him. I will!
- I think Parker survived this Q better than my last Q where he was the FNG!
- Great turn out this week even with the colder temperatures setting in.
