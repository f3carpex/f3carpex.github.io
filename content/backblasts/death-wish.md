**Pre-Blast**

- Charles Bronson once said, "Maybe I'm too masculine." He was referring to the fact that he was not getting certain movie roles.
- After the strong showing I witnessed this morning, the 10 HIM who joined YHC this morning won't get hired either.

**The Warmup**

- Pledge of Allegiance at the flag
- Run the long way around the middle school out to the street back down and halfway up Andy Hill.
- Circle up for: Michael Phelps arm swings, Groiner Merkins, extended plank series with stretches and exercises.

**T****he T****hang****s**

- The Charles Bronson: perform 50 reps of the called exercise, run 4 light poles up Andy Hill (approx. 120 yards) and then bear crawl one more light pole (approx. 30 yards). Pick up the six. Rinse. Repeat. We did rounds of: Freddie Mercuries, Standard Merkins, SSH, Quick Feet, Prisoner Squats, LSF
- Australian Nipplers on the way back to the flag.
