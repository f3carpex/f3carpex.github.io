**Pre-BB**

The FMJ Q-Coozies are awesome. Nice work, Shank. To be clear, though, it was NOT for the wet Coozie that YHC partnered with Pet Sounds on this unusually warm and stormy morning in the PEX. YHC enjoys the challenge - to post, let alone Q, in the monsoon conditions that were forecast promised to be a great challenge to overcome. YHC couldn't pass up the opportunity.

**BB**

9 mariners manned up and made waves with Pet Sounds and YHC at FMJ.

Conditions: dark, steady to heavy rain, moderate winds, low 60's. Let's go.
