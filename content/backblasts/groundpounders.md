YHC rolled into Jones Park with WWW in his truck full of toys, ready to close out the Carpex-to-SW part of #QSwapWeek at Groundpounders. The parking lot filled up quickly with friendly faces, some from Carpex, some from South Wake, and before long we had a crowd too big to fit the workout we had meticulously planned. Looks like we need to modify, so we'll modify as needed.

**Warm-Up** WWW takes us on a lap around the pickle and circle up for good mornings, hamstring stretches, Sir Fazios forwards and backwards, air presses, seal claps, overhead claps, calf stretches with merkins, mountain climbers, and plank jacks.

**The Thang** Throw in a few squats and side straddle hops while WWW works out some technical difficulties, then Thunderstruck! Run in place while we listen to the ACDC song, and do a burpee every time they say "THUNDER".

Hand off to Disco Duck and partner up by size and with someone from the other region if possible. Line up in the middle of the parking lot and wheelbarrow to the end, stopping at each line for two merkins, flapjack and travel back to the middle.

Mosey over to WWW's truck and grab a cinder block for four corners. Cusack your coupon around the parking lot, stopping at the corners for the following exercises.

1st corner: 5 overhead presses 2nd corner: 5 overhead presses, 10 curls 3rd corner: 5 overhead presses, 10 curls, 15 rows 4th corner: 5 overhead presses, 10 curls, 15 rows, 20 squats

Travel back around the parking lot, stopping at the corners for the following exercises.

1st corner: 5 squats 2nd corner: 5 squats, 10 rows 3rd corner: 5 squats, 10 rows, 15 curls 4th corner: 5 squats, 10 rows, 15 curls, 20 overhead presses

Hand off to WWW for Two Rounds With Tyson, line up at the first speed bump, mosey to then other side and back, stopping at each speed bump for five burpees. Repeato with ten sumo squats at each speed bump.

**Mary** Circle up and go around the circle for pax-led exercises, including LBCs, Freddie Mercurys, Homer-to-Marge, pickle pounds, burpees and 100s.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  28 **Name-a-rama**:  6 RESPECT, 19 meh, 3 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Praises for Ausfhart, he is back at home, continued prayers for his recovery; praises for Swag's M, her cancer had NOT spread to her lymph nodes, continued prayers for her treatment and recovery

**BOM**:  WWW took us out

**NMS** Q-Swap Week continues next week with our South Wake brothers coming to Carpex and reciprocating the paint. Can't wait!!!

Thunderstruck is always a crowd favorite, there's somewhere between 30 and 300 burpees in there.

Ezekiel completed his first six pack, nice work brother!

Pikachu....bro, get some shorts.

M4L rolled in to the parking lot just in time for Mary. You show up late to a WWW workout and you get penalty burpees, and today they were wolverines.

We were gonna do those burpees anyway.

Blue Water posts in a cotton t-shirt no matter what the weather is, and if that's not enough to make you love the guy he's the one who called burpees during Mary.

We were gonna do those burpees anyway.

28 pax this morning, and big numbers all week, #QSwapWeek seems to be catching on.

Thanks again to the South Wake crew, we've had a great time posting with you this week and we can't wait to see what you have for us when you visit Carpex next week.
