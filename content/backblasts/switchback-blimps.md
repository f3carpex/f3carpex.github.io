Count-a-rama - 15 Name-a-rama - Welcome FNGs High Tower and Whirlie Announcements: An OTB convergence on ITB at Pullen Park this Saturday at 6:30 AM. Hosted by F3 North Wake, F3 South Wake and F3Carpex. Prayer Requests: For our missing Nantan - Ma Bell. We hope he is okay. YHC took us out.

NMS: I was so nervous for my first Q and wrote everything out on a Weinke and planned it all out to the very last minute and practiced cadence counting and didn't sleep well the night before and I have now pulled off my first true full Callahan! 2 weeks in a row the FWD Q was MIA at 0545. At least Water Wings showed up by 0546 last week... Seriously, I hope Ma Bell is okay. I am signed up to Q FOD next week. Does anyone want to meet for breakfast next Tuesday at around 5:45? Great work FNGs! My M and her small group have done some great EH work on their worse halves: Joe Smith, Oofta, YHC Hermes, GMO, Mufasa, Pantone and FNG Whirlie.

As Callahan so eloquently stated in a BB last week, let this mornings work out be the least of the "great things" you are going to do today!
