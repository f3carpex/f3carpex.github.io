3 guys did some ECP or something b/c they think South Cary couldnt handle it. I think it started at 5ish.  
5:45 - "Disclaimer" was stated, literally. Follow me, the path around the ball fields is closed, like with a fence closed in case you were wondering. Do some penalty burpees for YHC not knowing this. Jog over to the nice soft field and circle up for some warm up stuff. Thanks for joining us Pigeon, 10 penalty burpees OYO.  
The Thang: Get a traveling rock, do V-ups at each light pole 5, 10, 15, 20, 25. Mime in a Box while we wait for the 6. Do this again with curls, tricep extensions and OH Presses. Put the rocks back. Do it again with LBCs but in cadence and do 10, 20, 30, 40, 50. Do it again with Superman pulses 5, 10, 15, 20, 25.. Do it again with Merkins 5, 10, 15, 20, 25. 
Jog back to the flag for have a nice days with no talking. 5 penalty burpees because people were talking.  
COT:  
15, some meh's, some Respects, a hate.  
July 4th we celebrate our independence with a 7:00 AM convergence at Bond Park. All other AOs are closed.  
Prayer requests: Hi Liters' daughter in counseling, Liverpool's achiles pain, Praise for Earhart's recovery.

NMS: It was an honor to Q this site, great site, great options, just wish it was a little closer to my house.  
We kind of had the old guard back out today. And some new guys.  
Great to see Roasters out for his 3rd post this morning!
