33 Pax gathered to celebrate YHC's 35th birthday... well actually, they gathered to watch what would happen when Frisco drank a half gallon of milk prior to the beatdown. Banjo joined Frisco in the lactose challenge. Surprisingly, they were able to keep it all down during the workout. Pickles and Parker got in some EC merkins and several pax got in an EC fellowship run with Half. Once the new start time of 0530 rolled around, we were off!

COT

Liverpool's brother, Pelican Brief, visiting from Philly was our only FNG. He's an environmental lawyer so naming him was a piece of cake for this birthday boy. Announcements included the Odyssey, a Saturday convergence with Ruck/F3/FIA (Michelob has your F3 Q), and the F3 Carpex Picnic coming up. Prayers for Swag's dad, Liverpool & Pelican Brief's mom, Khaki's friends, Joe Smith's M & soon to be 2.4. YHC took us out in prayer.

NMS

I bear the name Imp proudly because I am proud to be from Cary. More importantly though, I am proud to be a son of a loving Heavenly Father who loves me and is keenly aware of me. We should all try to take time today to make sure those around us are reminded that they are children of a God who loves them and knows them personally.
