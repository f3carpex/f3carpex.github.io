- I’ve dropped my teeth and I need to find them
- Getting up in the middle of the night
- Cashing the Social Security Check at the bank
- We may be over the hill, but…
- Where’s my walker
- Taking the grandkids to the playground
- Bingo time
- I’ve fallen and I can’t get up

Meet at the Senior Center naturally. Your guides will be Grinch and Term Paper
