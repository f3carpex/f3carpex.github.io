- **When:** 03/28/2019
- **QIC:** Pet Sounds
- **The PAX:** Lite-brite, Chipper, Bluewater, Stabach, Largemouth, Denali, Sabre, Flaco and Pet Sounds

**Warm up** - run to the Dude Solutions office parking lot, SSH x25, Hillbillies, wide arm Merkins OMD20, Tin Soldier 20IC, Good Morningx15, something else but you had to be there mozy through the parking lot to the start of the sidewalk on Regency Parkway

**Thang 1 - One and Only thing we did**

Run the large circle of Regency Pkwy to Enderlee and back to the lot for Mary.  Along the way…. Stop at every firehydrate for 10 Merkins & Squats, then at every curb cut 10 burpees.

Who would have thought there were firehydrates at half the curb cuts….

If you are wondering we did: 170 Burpees, ~100 Merkins, ~100 Squats, over 2.4 miles

**Announcements**

April 4/5th 24 hours of prayer

**Prayer Requests**

Thank you Chipper for taking us out today.    

**Naked Moleskin**

Thank you all for being the influence I need,  No Idea where I would be without you all.
