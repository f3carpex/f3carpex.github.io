Announcements

Prayer Concerns

Missy, co-worker of YHC, just diagnosed with breast cancer and having mastectomy next week

NMS

YHC had a lot of fun pulling this together, but as Disco pointed out, the workout was anything but fun.

It was pretty easy to identify a signature move for many, but I had to make some judgment calls based on BB intel and interviews, and when nothing stuck out, went with their F3 name.

Clarification on Goose and SSHs. He made us do 100 on his Respect Q, so it made sense to use move.

Kilmer apparently did call 4 corners with 5 burpees in the middle for his VQ (per PBX and Katniss)

Grease and YHC audibled to flutters for box cutters per our norm

Many thanks to Hermes for keeping me on track during 12 days. It is much easier to do ALRS in cadence than trying to count out x number of them.

I needed to bring in Mississippi or Crimson to call out my F3 cadence run lyrics (or whatever they are called) because that is not my strength. Thankfully Hermes bailed me out again with eskimos and whiskey chants

Playlist – Good Tune with Bon Jovi intro naturally

Small numbers but a STRONG group

Always an honor and a privilege to lead
