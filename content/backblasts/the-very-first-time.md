It was my first Q and it was 5:10. I saw headlights start streaming into the parking lot and I started feeling a bit nervous. Just recently through Hermes Q School, I knew I was prepared. Fourteen PAX and one FNG Sunshine (son of Intervention) assembled by the flag. I mumbled the disclaimer, mission and then we recited the Pledge of Allegiance. Off we went with a short mosey across the street to the far end of the parking lot.
