COT

Pleasure leading this fine group this morning. It was a special birthday celebration for me as my son and daughter all share the same birthday. Started the day off the best way possible, working out, sweating and finishing off a with a much needed prayer at the end. Love the mumble chatter from the guys, especially Frisco calling people out (including myself), EarharT calling me out (well deserved) and Sour Mash calling out the hold time for Control Freak merkins. Have a great week. #ironsharpensiron #faith
