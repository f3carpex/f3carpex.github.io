The Steve showed a cloudy start to the day, but small chance of rain until later.

The Steve was wrong.

Nine PAX were at the flag when the clock struck 0530. A very short and poorly delivered disclaimer was given, then we started.

## Warm Up

SSHs, then warm up mosey to Kelly Road Park for Sir Fazio arm circles, Seal claps, Steve Earles, and CF Merkins.

## Thang 1

Get a partner for a traditional vanilla DORA. Partner 1 runs to the first wooden overpass on the greenway and back, while Partner 2 completes 100 Merkins, 200 LBCs, and 300 squats. Flip flop until complete.

## Thang 2

Mosey to the tennis courts. Partner 1 bear crawls the length across all courts and moseys back while Partner 2 does sets of 10: diamond merkins, dying cockroaches and Bonnie Blairs. Until the Q says stop.

Instead of just running back to the flag, all PAX get a 540 to OC segment in. Then back to the flag.

## Mary

No time

## COT

4 Respects, 1 Hate, 4 Mehs. Remember TCP Sawgrass on Sunday

Prayers raised for Cataracts' 2.0, as well as Liverpool and Term Paper in their respective recoveries. YHC took us out.

## NMS

- YHC hasn't been that soaking wet in a long time. It was the right move to go shirtless from the offset
- PBX enjoys playing in puddles
- Everyone had fun i think
- We resolved to be a little better today than yesterday
