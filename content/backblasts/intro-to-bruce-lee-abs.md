It is now officially summer.

How's everyone's beach body?  
When you think six-pack ... are you thinking beer belly or abs?

I've had this workout flagged for a while but wasn't quite sure when or how to pull it out. Decided today was as good a day as any.

Ma Bell and Franklin get an excused absence. The rest are in store for a beatdown in reverse.

#### Warm-up

Pickle laps  
GMs, Windmills, Merkins (32x), IW, PJs, MC  
Penalty burpees for a tardy someone. Can't remember who

#### Thang Mary

Moseyed over to the benches in front of the school for 4 sets of:

- 20x benchtop frog kicks / leg lifts
- 20x full sit up (focus on squeezing the abs)
- 20x full elbow twists

(see here for video demonstration from someone who looks like no one within our midst: [LINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQe3wUNk2Yc))

Sprint to the 5th light post and do 20 merkins

Repeato

After four sets, we made our way back by stopping at every light pole for more Mary:

- Freddy Mercs & Flutter kicks (lunge walk to light post)
- LBCs & supermans (gorilla hop to light post)
- L/R heel touches & heels to heaven (lunge walk)
- J Lo's (gorilla hop)

#### Mary

Back at the flag for SSH, merkins and shakira's

Finish with a pledge of allegiance at the flag.

#### COT:

- 15 PAX
- Announcements: food drive (don't ask Franklin for details) and TCP on Sunday @ 2PM
- Prayers: for Jen and unspoken

#### NMS

- Good to see Ma Bell out continue to shuffle. And props to Franklin for the company
- Music today brought to you by Amazon Music's "90s Alternative" station. Sadly I couldn't find "The Crow" soundtrack easily enough for the Bruce Lee connection. We were 'entertained' by Creed and Candlebox instead
- Speaking of which... Pivot has quite the story to tell of his Candlebox experience. Riptide would have been impressed
- Good to see Steak Knives out in the area again
- Pleased to meet Garden (g)Nomad. And happy to see Cadence turning into a regular!
