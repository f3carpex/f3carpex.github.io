The featured image came directly from a Google image search for the word "Fartsack." That is the highlight of this Claymore Q, since it featured the return of Notorious F.A.R.T. himself, @frisco! In classic Frisco style, we're already warmed up and about to start Thang 1 by the time he rolls up in his Vespa-like eco-car. After we finished up our penalty burpees, the MC commenced and quite literally didn't stop even though I could smell the merlot peaking up over the back of his tongue...alas, we got no merlot. On to the workout:

NMS: All joking aside, it was great to see Frisco back in the fold. The HIMs were motivated and pushed through the sprints like champs!
