I was awoken by the 2.1 at 4:38am and after a quick diaper change I decided to look up who had the Q of Dante's Peak this morning.  Boy was I surprised to see that YHC had signed up (likely during another sleepless night).  Time to rise to the occasion and make somebody sweat.  27 pax arrived for an early morning tour of Apex nature park.

**Warm-Up**

Hold that thought as 5, yes 5 pax arrived late. 10 penalty burpees (2 per late member) OYO

**Let's try this again Warmup**

**NMS -**Alas just did not fit the FNG.  Being a former college linebacker, Blitz seemed to be a better fit -Everyone knows the nantan loves a merkin, but YHC believes he overheard what MaBell hates -I'll give you a hint....its the bear crawl -It's rather poor form to arrive 15mins late for work during your first month of a new job, but YHC did just that this morning -Thankfully there are no penalty burpees at work
