Wordpress sucks. "Separate with commas or hit enter key", what they mean is: list all the PAX and then we will magically auto-delete some of them so you can re-enter them. Does this happen to anyone else? Is it just me? I fall in that range between Boomer and Millenial so maybe I'm not even supposed be using word press. While I'm on this Soundest of All Pets box, when I hit enter, why does it skip a line and insist on starting a new paragraph? Are bullet points not allowed in Wordpress. Microsoft owns the word processing market, please just acknowledge that and copy MS Word. Google understands this, when will Wordpress?

Okay, now for the back blast:

(I apologize for the weird line breaks above this sentence, I made the mistake of hitting "Enter")  
Oh look, if you hit Shift and Enter at the same time it does it right. I'm on a roll now:  
\- 4 Pax for the Ambien EC run: Flip Flop, Augmented, Lookout and Staubach.  
\- 18 for the main event, its 530: Insert standard disclaimer/mission, pledge allegiance and follow me.  
\- Warm up in one of the office building parking lots across the street on a slope.  
\- follow me, jog to the ground floor of the new parking deck behind the new office building, adjacent (no he wasnt there) to the yet another Boomer hotel being built in cary.  
\- Lets inflate some BLIMPS with a stop at each turn in the parking deck ramps. 5 Burpees, 5 burpees + 10 Lunges, and so on adding Imp(was there)erial Walkers, Merkins, Plank Jacks and Star Jumps.  
\- That's a nice wall at the top of this deck, since Largemouth is not here, lets do a BTTW challenge, do some WW(W was not there)2's upon BTTW failure. Then lets all do 20 WW2s to celebrate YHC's victory in this challenge.  
\- Well the inflated BLIMPS won't fit in the Chick Fil A or our cars, so we need to deflate them. Do deflate them going back down the parking deck.  
\- Jog back to the flag arriving at precisely 0615 (thanks for the time check Schlitz). Well most of us made it back at 0615. 
\- Count-a-Rama 18  
\- Name-a-Rama - see the PAX list  
\- Announcements:  
\- BRR sign up only 8 spots left  
\- Escalator bible study on Wednesdays at 0630 at Waverly Chick Fil A. No homework, just show up.  
  
Prayer Requests: only unspoken prayers  
YHC took us out.

NMS:  
\- Well at least that Yoast character has been tamed a little.  
\- I generally despise technology that is intentionally confusing to users. Is it trying to create loyalty by using weird names and nicknames for things that don't need nicknames. So annoying. Any organization that has to create weird names for things definitely won't make it.....  
\- Other things I dislike:  
\- lists  
\- Irony  
\- Point Break should launch its own line of lip moisturizing products, because its the BALM!  
\- Did anyone else think Schlitz was going to share some Merlot on the parking deck this morning? He had that look for a minute.  
\- Remember that time Skipper puked on a parking deck? Pretty sure mr. Nantan was there.  
\- Great work this morning men! Its an honor to be among such legends!  
\- Am I supposed to enter in the QIC? Or does it just assume whoever is posting the BB is the Q?  
\- QIC: Hermes (just in case).  
\- WP Complaint number 47: Don't hit the "preview button" unless you want to watch how to draw a W for about 30 minutes.
