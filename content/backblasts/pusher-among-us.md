Amazingly beautiful morning at A-Team!  Crisp & cool with almost daylight from the start…..

17 HIMs gathered -- One FNG.  F3 intro given & we started with the pledge.  Moseyed around the first parking lot & crossed over to the other for:

The Warm Up

Circle up for good mornings, windmills, calf stretch merkins, sir fazio, SSH, etc.  Mosey over to the greenway trail for:

Thang 1 –

Straight up vanilla 7’s on the hill – descending Burpees at the bottom with ascending CDDs at the top.  Good work done here….

Mosey deeper into the park for:

Thang 2 –

Split into two groups – group one, suicides on basketball court while group two does BTTW.  Alternate.  Repeat with people’s chair.  Mosey down to the wooden guard rails for rounds of irkins, dirkins, & dips.  Continue back to front part of the park.
