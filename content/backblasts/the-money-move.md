Recently YHC was in Chapel Hill where Yanni led the pax through 50 prom night Merkins to the pax chagrin, as is if those glory days were not a bar set high, much like Burts high school fro bringing him in at 5'10". This is real stuff for these men of action. Hermes alone would scoff at such a weak execution and bow out that chest and announce three or four more rounds.

YHC was inspired to test these high impact men. Not with some tasteless bowl of bear gruel, but a hearty Manwich style test of meddle and fortitude. The goal was to best Yanni and provide men like Hermes a new cravat of honor.

Though, as you can imagine there were some truly tasteless jokes.  But the pax seemed to fall into a rhythm, and they were off quicker than a prom queens dress on prom night. Burt was putting out more mumble chatter than a drunk prom date,  though he skipped the pillow talk and went straight for the wham Bam thank you ma'am. Sporting his pink pussy hat, Hermes was heard grunting in his preferred wet spot. YHC overheard Pierogi stating, "that's the money move". All 12 pax performed and got up for six rounds. I suppose Shank enjoyed that cigarette. It was no soccer game.
