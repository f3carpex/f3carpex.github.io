It won't be 10, but ya boi will lock it down this week, so let's go.

\--

To start: Heavy hearts across F3 Raleigh and beyond after hearing the news that Warchild (Alec Romulus) lost his battle with addiction this weekend. He was way too you. We lifted up him and his family through a moment of silence before the workout and many of our pax were in black from head to toe.

\--

The warmup:

- 2 FNGs present so a top-notch disclaimer and impeccable F3 mission statement and we're off
- Over to the first lot for: GM, SSH, SFAC, OHC, SC, SFAC and Merkins

The Thang:

- Partner up for lil Dora: 25 Burpees, 50 CDD and 75 V-ups whilst running the lot
- Mosey to the other lot
- Take a quick break to review the 5 core principles of F3
- Partner back up for regular Dora: 100 merkins, 200 squats and 300 LBCs while running all the way to the bottom of the hill and back
- Get the FNGs up to the front (Brian and Chris by hospital names) and at their pace get back to the front lot
- Liverpool introduces Eskimo Merkins from the boys in Omaha. These are a Merkin where you touch your nose to the ground and each time down increase the nose hold by 1. So, hold for 1 and up, hold for 2 and up, hold for 3 and up. He made us go all the way up to 12. It was terribly awesome.

Mary: We finished up with a combo of Mary and quick feet while also doing switch position across the parking a lot

COT: 27, welcome FNGs Roasters and Willy Wonka. Cataracts took us out.

NMS: Burt said "posish"a lot today. Make it a great day!
