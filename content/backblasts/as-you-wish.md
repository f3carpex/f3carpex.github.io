Well, a day passed, and so did a year.  First post and Q of the new age, at the greatest AO in Downtown Apex on a Thursday morning.  Tossed the notion of an EC run out there, and I was joined by the Site Q in training, Sub, and the craziest man in Carpex right now, @djvtec (who has just signed on as the sixth man, on the 6-man 2019 BRR team, aptly named F3 Carpex Pick up the Six (TM) (R).  0452 roll out (took a minute or so to get my watch to cooperate) and we were off.  Took the guys along a nice little greenway tucked within Heatherwood, Indian Trails, and Shepherds Vineyard.  Covered about 3.5 miles, nice conversation, and got warmed up in the process.  Promised 4 miles, but I think we were done.

Anyway, for the main event, Q noticed an open gate to the pitch, and did a quick audible for our starting spot to get warmed up a little.  After Tuesday's debacle with not noticing an FNG, Q was extra diligent to ask.  And looky there...an FNG "Brian".  Welcome Brian.  Disclaimer stated, off we go for...

Pledge of Allegiance in cadence

**Warmup:**

Run into the wide open soccer/LACROSSE field (thanks PAX) for a warmup lap.

- **Regular run**
- **backwards run**
- **carioca left**
- **carioca right**
- **Backwards run across the other "end zone"**
- **combo of high knees/buttkickers down the other sideline**  
- **Near endzone was lunge walks to halfway**
- **then run into the red circle (used for lacrosse apparently...looking at Largemouth for advice)**

When there, get in some:

- **SSH**
- **GMs**
- **IWs**
- **Merkins**

Then off we go.

**Start of The Thangs**

Jog across the street, headed south towards downtown.  A pause for regroup just past Mr. A's Beignets and some **squat pulses**.

Quick stop in at the skyscraper for a **Merkin circle**, 5 rounds, with various **planks** in between.

Then off we go down to the crosswalk.  Kid you not, @smokey61 came blazing past the Q...#larrybird!

At the crosswalk, we did the safe thing, hit the button to cross the street, within the crosswalk....then proceeded to Abbey Road lunge walk across-nearly running out of time on the countdown timer.

Follow me back north, then a quick left around the corner of the Halle Center (did you know it was a jail, and a town hall, and...heck just look here: [Halle History](http://www.thehalle.org/533/History-of-the-Halle)

Here we are, let's get warmed up a little more.

**More of The Thang**

Dora 123 from here to way down there and back.

- **100 Merkins**
- **200 squats**
- **300 LBCs**

Frisco I don't want to hear your chatter about running workouts...my man was cruising past the Q out there.  #Larrybird x 2

Time drawing short, time to set a course for Mount Michelob.  Loosely arranged Indian  Indigenous People's Run down to Hinton Street.

**The Hills are Alive**

Original plan was **10 sumo squats** at the bottom, **run to the first mailbox**, return to the bottom.  **10 lunge jumps**, then **run up to the 2nd mailbox**, back to the bottom.  About the 2nd time up, Imp casually mentions "You know we're never going to make any progress doing it this way, right?"

Duh.

So a bit of an **audible** occurred, and we started making headway up the hill.  A final audible after 3 rounds, and we all headed for the top.  All arrived, 10-count from Bogo, then we were off towards Brittany Trace.  A quick pause there to regroup, doing some **Al Gore squat pulses**, then on up to Salem Street.  A quick #PUT6 and we crossed together.

As we came in for a landing, who's the FNG standing by the flag?  Wait, that's no FNG, that's... @denalicarpex!  5:30 Denali, 5:30.

Into the bowl for some quick mary, but not before **5 penalty burpees**.

Hit the deck for:

- **10 world's worst merkins**
- **10 box cutters**
- **Have a Nice Freakin' Day**

**Announcements:**

- Almost through the Q swap week down South, get ready for next week!
- Ausfahrt's coming home! Looks like Friday.
- Sosa's hosting a nutrition session on 2/2. After the KKC. Seems fitting.

**Prayer concerns:**

- Ausfahrt's recovery
- Swag's M
- Career change opportunities for several of our brothers
- RPD Officer Ainsworth's healing path
- Other unspokens

**NMS**

- GTL's crazy. "So, what do you know about the BRR?" he asks innocently. I start rattling off a few things from my 2 years of participating, talking about van camaraderie, what to do while your van's idle, that sort of thing. "Yeah, so I'm on a 6-man team I believe." Me: "Wow. Whose?" "Michelob, maybe Denali, some of those guys." Head shake. Rest of EC run kinda quiet on my front.
- Sub's got wheels. Ma Bell said so, and he's right.
- Smokey is quick y'all. Came roaring up in my blind spot and I had to go catch him before we ran clean through DTA.
- Don't let Frisco fool you with his Claymore front. Dude was flying during Dora. T-ceps!
- I need to plan better. Had I known the field would've been open, I would've spent more time there. It is pristine. I had something in my mind and didn't modify it to suit the needs of the day. I will do better next time men. But, thank you gents for getting in over 2.5 miles in the course of our tour of the Metropolitan area.
- \* the first words we hear Boba Fett say.
