The PAX at Wolverine celebrated the 224th day of the Gregorian calendar on August 12, 2019. After a quick disclaimer and pledge, we moseyed across Davis Drive and to the middle school parking lot. Several warm-up exercises were completed, including a set of Ernie Davis Heismans (we missed you, Biner).

To celebrate the 224th day of 2019, the group enjoyed a Gregorian merkin mile – 4 laps around the track, with 4 sets of 22 merkins at the conclusion of each lap. Prior to, and after, the merkin mile, sets of 22 exercises (like mountain climbers, El Capitans, dips, left-right step ups and others) were paired with 4 burpees. 22-4…224, get it?

Welcome FNG, Gibraltar
