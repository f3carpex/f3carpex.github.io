I was kicking it with HoppinJohn during our kids' baseball game last weekend, and I noticed his site needed a Q this week, so I jumped on it, with the warning that it would be BRR-tilted.

Stacked EC line-up: Mayflower, Bagels, Chops, Voltron.

Lots of folks milling around ahead of the start time. I asked Chops to be clear in the pre-blast that we were running today, and he was, so I assumed everyone was onboard for some envelope-pushing. 16 for the ME.

Pledge, no disclaimer (my bad), and we're off.

Mosey to the fire department for a warm-up. A fire fighter came screeching into the parking lot beeping his horn at us, so I wrapped this up quick.

Thing 1: Pearls on a string to MacGregor Lake

30-second waterfront meditation

Thing 2: Everything you have up the 1-mile Glasgow Hill

Thing 3: Pearls on a string to Waverly

Quick Mary and we're done.

**Announcements**: Chain Gang (Adopt a Highway) on August 21, Mabopane Golf Tournament on October 4

**Prayers**: Voltron's buddy NoShow, Bagel's bro

I took us out.

**NMS**:

A good day's work. First time anyone reached 4 miles at Point Break, and first time anyone ventured into MacGregor. Let's keep pushing things forward.

I challenge everyone to find a few minutes of peace today, even if it's sandwiched by turmoil.
