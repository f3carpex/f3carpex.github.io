When Hanson asked for someone to step up and take his Q this morning YHC gladly accepted the challenge. The first detour was expected since it was well advertised that YHC would be the QIC. The next detour was caused by the locked gates. The site Q's need to see someone about that since it was starting to be a regular occurrence. The third detour was YHC realized the field was locked. Usually, YHC plan workouts on the fly but this time I had a nice routine planned for the soccer field. That'll teach me to plan a workout!

At 5:45 shape, we did a quick pledge and off to the warm up circle. Over the next few minutes the number of PAX doubles as more roll in from their EC run from the bella casa pool.

Warm up:

- SSH
- Good Morning
- Sir fazio
- Overhead clap
- 10 penalty burpees OYO
- mountain climbers
- 10 merkins OYO

Mosey to the top of the hill, squat hold for the 6, mosey to the (locked) gates and hold for the 6, finally ending up at the other gate at the nature park entrance.

Thing 1:

- 11's - split into two groups. Group one stays at the gate for 10 monkey humpers. Other group runs to light pole for 10 merkins. each group goes down from there for standard 11's.

Thing 2: A surprise DETOUR!

- At the pond, choose a detour - Sit ups or Pull ups
- Pull up group, run to pull up bars and perform 10 pull ups and meet on the other side of the pond
- Sit up group, run to the other side of the bridge and do 10 LBCs in cadence count and meet on the other side of the pond.

Mosey back towards the flag, stopping to bear crawl bear crawl bridge

Thing 3:

- In the parking lot, pick a spot towards the warm up circle. Go 80% to that spot and return.
- Pick a parking spot for bearpees up to 4

Mary:

- 100's
- Homer to Marge

And with that we were out of time!

Prayers:

- Headroom's FIL Daryl
- Puddle's friend Mike with cancer
- Smithers requesting prayers for front line workers and our country

YHC took us out!

NMS:

- YHC may have watched too many Amazing Race seasons in quarantine. It was fun to make my own detour
- I didn't plan ANY of the workout this morning, so always be prepared for a backup if things don't work out
- It was great to have Rooney's 2.0 there this morning. He was able to keep up with us and I actually saw him out running his dad! Welcome FNG Ferris!
- You guys rock. Spread some good in each of your worlds.
