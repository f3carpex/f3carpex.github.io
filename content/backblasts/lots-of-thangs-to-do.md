15 pax looked to start off their Friday with a pep in their step.

YHC was looking to push us this morning and keep the pax moving through LOTS of Thangs!

Callahan and his dumb online poll showed up. Glad to have him out there. 15 pax in all.

- We ran the bus loops.
- We circled to the basektball courts
- We ran the field hills with wall climbers
- We ran to the shelter
- We did shelter work
- We ran a gym lap with playground exercises

We did a lot of thangs.
