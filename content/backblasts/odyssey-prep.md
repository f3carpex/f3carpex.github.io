Honestly, I had no plan when I started out yesterday morning other than to provide a solid beat down. After a quick pledge we were off to the lower parking lot. Why? Because I seem to always start there.

Warm up

Circle up for:

- Good Mornings
- Burpees to calm the mumble chatter
- SSH
- Sir Fazio Arm Circles
- Seal claps
- Some more burpees
- Mountain climbers

During the warm up, Callahan commented that he had completed many burpees this week. To me, it sounded like he wanted to finish his week off strong!

Quick mosey to edge of the parking lot to begin our trek to the end of the road at the stop sign on the other end of the park, stopping at every third light pole for five burpees. After waiting for the six at the stop sign we continued up to the playground, stopping at every other light pole for five burpees.

Thing 1:

Partner up. I like to stay with your partner during the workout for addition accountability and fellowship. Half PAX go to playground for 10 pull ups each and other half head over towards the bathroom building for BTTW for a 30 count. Flip flop. Repeat for a total of three times.

Thing 2:

Mosey to boat house parking lot for Dora. 50 Merkins, 100 LBCs, and 150 Mountain Climbers.

Thing 3:

Mosey to the kiosk for 7's. On the way to the Kiosk YHC commented to Hermes that this felt like a mini-Odyssey. Once we arrived, it was dips at the bottom and squat jumps at the top. Staying with your partner.

Return to the flag, with a quick jog through the community center parking lot.

Mary:

- LBCs
- Homer to marge
- Low slow flutters and other PAX choice
- Of course, Disco Duck add some additional burpees
- And a solid round of Hello Dolly. Hey Girrrl!

Prayers

- Prayers for PAX: Navin and other PAX that have been MIA. Reach out to some one you haven't seen in a while!
- Prayers for coworkers: Pigeon's coworker
- Prayers for friends: Yogi's friend who lost a son and nephew this past week.

NMS

YHC had a rough week last week. May of you were the light that I needed in a dark patch. Special thanks to Smokey for dropping wisdom my way. And to all of you that have supported me.

I wanted to leave you with a core thought: Be the light for someone today.

John 1:5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.  

1 John 1:5-6  
This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light; in him there is no darkness at all. If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth.
