One never knows what to expect on April 1st. YHC decided to play it straight, and keep the PAX wondering. At 05:29, twenty PAX had gathered around the flag in anticipation - April Fool's jokes or not? After the Pledge of Allegiance, we're off.

### Warm Up

Two laps around the pickle with some backwards running, Karaoke both ways, and high knees.

Circle up for SSHs, Good Mornings, Steve Earles, Moroccan Night Clubs, Overhead Claps, Plank Jacks and Control Freak Merkins.

### The Thang

Partner up for Catch-Me-If-You-Can around the big field. At the end of each lap, each person completes 10 pull-ups on the playground.

- Lap 1: Your exercise is 10 Bobby Hurleys. Complete 10 Partner Clap Merkins on the switch.
- Lap 2: Pivot selects Star Jumps as our exercise. Complete 5 Bropees on the switch.
- Lap 3: The exercise is 3 World's Worst Merkins. Complete 10 Partner Clap Diamond Merkins on the switch.
- L/R step ups while the PAX complete their last pull-ups after lap 3; then head the to basketball court. Partner 1 BTTW while Partner 2 Bear Crawls/Crawl Bear the court, then flip flop.
- Mosey back to the flag

### Mary

LBCs, Dying Cockroaches, Homer2Marge, Low Slow Flutters, then Have a Nice Day.

### COT

3 Respects, 1 Hate, 16 Mehs

Some announcements about TCP Sawgrass signups and the 24 hour prayer vigil on April 5/6. Prayers going up for several dealing with cancer and other health issues. YHC took us out.

### NMS

- No real April Fool's jokes here. Don't want to be too cliche.
- It really is dark at Wolverine.
- What is cool is that for someone in Apex, I can take the short trip over and see some guys that I don't see that often. Nice to see fresh faces.
- Carpex has a strong name game. Geek Squad and One Direction as prime examples. Stay weird.
- It really wasn't shirtless Broga, but after Pivot jumped on Slack and hyped that, let's stay with the theme. Plus it made you read this.
- MIAGD gents, be a little better than you were yesterday.
