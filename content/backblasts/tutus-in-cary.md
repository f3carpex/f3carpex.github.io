18 HIM gather for a rare, EarharT Q in Downtown Cary.  I personally love the AO, just hard to post when BH is 3 minutes from my house.  Anywho, clock strikes 5:45 and it is time to get going.  We head down the street and to the right, crossing the street and circling up in front of the bank for (the new lights are very bright):

## Warm Up

Good mornings

Cotton Pickers

Side Straddle Hops

Imperial Walkers

 

## The Thang

Done with our warms we head back to the main street and stop at a light pole where Q calls for ascending burpees at each light pole, heading to the fountain, adding one burpee for each light pole.  Half way through we were stretching out as a PAX, so Q called an audible to count down once we reached 7 burpees.  On the way, Red Ryder (fellow Apex HIM), enjoyed the trees decorated with tutu’s.  What a nice touch for a workout.  Seen in Cary…..

We finally all arrive at the fountain, after we pick-up the six (we are not whiplash).  We gather around the fountain and around the wall for a round of:

15 Dips

15 Urkins

15 left-right-step-ups

15 Dirkins

Finish this round and perform some lunge walks around the fountain.  Get back to your original spot, or close to it, and perform another round of dips, urkins, left-right steps, dirkins.  Bear crawl half-way around the fountain then head to the Art Center (everyone cross together!!)

Next up we mosey over to some stairs.  Q calls for a 7s, bunny-hop up the stairs for 6 CDDs at the top, run down the ramps on either side, and perform and 1 starjump at the bottom.  We go up and around until we are finally done.  Plank hold, performing a 10 count around the PAX.

Time to head back to the flag.  We mosey to one of our lightpoles from earlier, and, since we are tight on time for burpees, Q tells PAX to perform descending prisoner squats until we reach the street back to the flag.  Some EC burpees for the front-runners.

Break into groups and give-it-all-you got to the flag and circle up for:

## Mary

To encourage some of these new faces, Q asks each of the VQs to call out their own exercise of choice.  We did some hammers, LBCs, cockroaches, and some mountain climbers.

The bell tolls 6:30 and we are done.
