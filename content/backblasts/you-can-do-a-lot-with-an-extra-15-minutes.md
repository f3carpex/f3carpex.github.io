I was glad to finally have some "approved" extra time for my workout this morning. I had been struggling with finishing on-time all week, so if I couldn't bring this one back home in time, I may need to seek help.

But since 60 minutes just isn't enough for some people we also had two groups of EC runners. At 5:45 YHC, Snots, Hi-Liter and Chipper for a 4 miler and at 6:05 Disco Duck, Texas Ranger, Yoga Mat, Liverpool and Air Supply for 2 miles. (btw/ is it Air or Hair? because I can't find Air Supply on slack)

On the run someone asked me if I was going to limit the run for Phoenix. I said yes, I was going to limit it to Bond Park.

A quick change to a dry shirt, and away we go.

**Warm-Up**

A quick zig zag through the parking lot lead us back to where we started for some: Hillbilly, SSH, Bolt 45s, Sprinkler, Plank Jack, Arm Circles

**Thang 1**

A quick mosey to the other parking lot and we grabbed a partner and an ego rock. P1 did curls, while P2 completed 5 burpees, switch. Round two, same thing but P1 did shoulder presses, round three P1 did overhead tricep extensions. Repeato the whole thing.

We then went around the corner to the back wall. P1 Aussie Mountain Climber for a 20 cadence count, while P2 held the rock over their head in squat position. Switch the Repeat.

**Thang 2**

Headed down to the big open field and placed 2 cones about 50 yards apart. P1 began to crab walk, P2 started at cone #1 did 10 merkins and 20 LBCs, then ran to cone #2 then swapped with their partner. P1 then ran to cone #1 to do the same exercise, then cone #2, then swapped with their partner. We continued this until we had crab walked two down and backs.

**Thang 3**

Moseyed over to the playground. Staying with partners, P1 was on their backs in 6" leg hold while P2 did 10 pull-ups. Before swapping places the partners completed 5 hand clap merkins. Repeato. Repeato.

Quick mosey over to the shelter to find a table and complete 48 Alternating Left/Right step-ups.

Then on our way back to the flag, because it was there, we sprinted up the hill, moseyed back down and sprinted up again.

To be honest I know there were some prayers and praises but I'm struggling to remember them. My apologies.

YHC took us out with a quote from author Marianne Williamson

> Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates other."
