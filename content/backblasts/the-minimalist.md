Semiannual-ish visit to FWD.

## Warm Up

Jog around the park circle and back to the flag. Warm up of SSHs, Sir Fazio arm circles, Steve Earles, Runners stretch and calf stretch. Merkins x 50

## The Thang

Mosey to my favorite church parking lot. 11s the length of the lot, which is up and down the hill. Burpees at the top, jump squats at the bottom. Finish with the six, do 25 standard merkins. Mosey back to the flag.

## Mary

Merkins x 25. HAND

## COT

Only one respect. What's up with that?

## NMS

Nothing, this is minimalist.
