Holy hell, dat yellow stuff is everywhere. Regardless, we pushed through.

A group of HIM out for an EC run, and YHC set off to chase down Theismann for ECP. [Check out our convo on getting better on today's PUT6](https://soundcloud.com/f3pickupthesix/pick-up-the-six-theismann-ep-49).

We wrapped up recording just in time to hear the pax getting restless, it must be spot on 0545. A backwards run for the Q gave me a chance to drop the moving disclaimer on the pax before we're up to the lot for warmups.

Warm-ups:

- Welcome back Frisco, oh and you're wearing a kilt from your Scotland trip, to boot. First exercise was Monkey Humpers (naturally) followed by GM, SSH, Imperial Walkers, Ewalkers and Merkins.

The Thang:

- Move the pax over to The hill for 7's with CDD up top and Sumo Squats at the bottom. When done mosey back to the shelter
- Round of LRSU, Control Freak Erkins, Dips, Derkins x2
- Back on our feet and moving towards the front of the park.
- Big circle for #NoOYO burpees, 1-2-3-4-5-4-3-2-1 with messages of gratitude throughout and a sadclown testimonial from YHC, to boot. Thanks for letting me share, brothers. NO OYO!
- On their rumps for a long round of planks and mary combo.

COT: 26 with brother Sooey on the shuffle, tclaps to Hotspot and Ryder for rolling with him today. A few announcements and we lifted up prayers and praises. YHC took us out and asked for strength this week.

NMS:

- During the Monkey Humpers some hero went full William Wallace. Smokey saw it. Thank that guy for his leadership.
- MIAGD, brother! Lock shields with me.
