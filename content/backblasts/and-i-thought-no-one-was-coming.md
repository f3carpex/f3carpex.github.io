YHC forgot this was the 4 year anniversary of Shut-In (1/5/15 officially) so last week finding an empty Q slot at HBs was perfect!

YHC and The Joker did some ECPs while we waited for pax to show. I thought no one was coming but at 0525 the parade of headlights flooded the park. 15 pax were up and ready to go at 0530 for the disclaimer and pledge. Pax # 16 joined us after our loop around the pickle for warmup.
