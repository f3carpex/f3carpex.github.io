- 50 Pull Ups
- 100 Merkins
- 150 Bobby Hurleys

**Thang 2**

- Basketball Burpees
    
    - Divide into two teams
    
    - Each team takes turns shooting free throw until all Pax have shot
        
        - If free throw is made other team does 5 burpees
        
        - if misses his team does 5 burpees
    
    - Not surprisingly, there were a lot of bricks being thrown.  Took a minute to get PAX lined up correctly around the key.
