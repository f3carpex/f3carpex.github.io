Truth be told, YHC is feeling some pressure on this BB. But, in the words of a sage Carpex veteran:

"Keep it vanilla and Q to the site." - Carman Liuzzo, 57, Burt

**Wednesday, June 20th, will go down as an EPIC day in Carpex history. The menu looked like this:**

1. 0430 - 0500 HIMs launching for the 10.7 mile Maynard loop (14 by YHC's count)
2. 0505 HIMs launching for Insomnia, YHC on the route Q
3. 0545 HIMs gather for SNS + Tortoises + Vesper convergence at Bond Park
4. 0630 COT with 77 strong, followed by 2nd/3rd F fellowship and Chinese Downhill sharing this powerful and emotional story.

As for the SNS portion of this MEGA WEDNESDAY, here it is:

**Warm-up:**

- Before leaving the lot all Pax gather for the Pledge led by another true him, Hi-Liter
- SNS boys and Tortoises boys head out to split off at the Community Center, with the SNS boys headed for Carpex stadium
- Circle up (37 deep) for:
    - Good mornings
    - Merkins x 23, love you CD, love you Gibson
    - Other stuff :)
- Two flags placed about 30 yards apart, pax for a series of run and warm-up exercises

**The Thang:**

- Partner up at the kiosk (YHC pumped to partner with the one and ONLY Dice) for Dora (100 merkins, 200 squats, 300 LBCs)
- Back to Carpex Stadium for a BIG old Bull in the Burpee Ring. Winners stay in the circle, losers to the kiosk and back.
- Up the big hill and back over the rock pile by the Community Center.
- Say hi to the Tortoises crew.
- Grab a rock in a big circle for curls, triceps, press and rows. Repeato on a quick-count. Rocks back.
- Mosey to the pocket park.
- On the short wall for L/R, dips, Irkins, L/R, dips, Irkins.
- Into the grass for a round of Green Sally Up/Down (sorry you missed it Bartman, it sucked).
- Back to the lot.

Mary didn't show, YHC admits it was a little hectic back at the lot.

**COT:** 75 (2 more coming back from Maynard for 77)

Announcements (unruly with 77 on Pax), prayers including for our brother Snots who was back on hand. Love you, bro.

**NMS:**

- Welcome FNG's Balki and Hotty Toddy
- Boys, I believe I was correct in predicting that "it's going to be a day." It certainly was.
- Once again, the men of F3 prove that it's more than a workout. A BB and NMS aren't nearly enough to express how incredibly humbling it was to see that many Pax in one place, and to share in fitness, fellowship and faith with you all.
- Awesome to have guys from Raleigh, So Wake, and other regions join us. Hope you enjoy a taste of Cary Soft and Apex Strong.
- Tclaps abound, but a special tip of the cap to all that brought juice, water, Gatorade, coffee, food and supplies including Shut-In for tracking it all and getting it set up for us.
- Thank you, CD, for speaking from the heart and to our hearts. We love you, brother.
- Cheers boys, make it a great day, and attack the day with an enthusiasm unknown to man.
