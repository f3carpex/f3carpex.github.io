And they did this...

- 0545 Disclaimer and pledge
- Warm up at the kiosk
- Jog to Bueller shelter loop.
    - 4 stops around the loop
    - 5 merkins / 10 flutters / 15 dips / 20 hammers - Lap 1
    - 25 merkins / 30 flutters / 35 dips / 40 hammers - Lap 2
- Jog to pullup/monkey bars
    - Stationary 11s with WWP-Ups and Merkins
    - **World's Worst Pull-Ups** (Just like a WW Merkin but hanging from the bar! close grip, reg grip, wide grip. They sucked. Many of us just did 1 WWP-U each set...)
- Back to Bueller shelter for similar loop, this time with Squats and High Knees
- Jog back to the kiosk and do hill sprints until we're out of time
