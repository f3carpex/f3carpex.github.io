YHC hadn't Q'd a kettlebell workout before, but the pressure was lifted when I learned that neither Site Qs Triple Lindy or Wahoo would be there. YHC brought the keurig and Theismann brought the flag, we were all set. No FNGs, so pledge and down to business.

## Warm up

- Mosey around parking lots
- SSH IC x12
- Windmills IC x12
- Imperial Walkers IC x12
- SF FWD + Seal Clap + SF BWD + OH Claps + Hallelujah's IC x12 ea

## Thang 1 - Crawlbear Kettlebell Backtracks

I was planning a tabata, but then I came across a kettlebell flow that inspired me to come up with what I'm calling the _Crawlbear Kettlebell Backtrack_. If you think that name is long and painful, then you've got a good idea of what the exercise is like.

Partner up.

**Round 1**: Partner 1 does **Haloes** while Partner 2 does **Crawl bear swings** with an ascending count up to 11 and moseys back. Then, partners switch.

**Round 2**: Partner 1 does **Curls** while Partner 2 does **Crawl bear sumo squats** with an ascending count up to 11 and moseys back. Then, partners switch.

**Round 3**: Partner 1 does **Presses** while Partner 2 does **KB Crawl bears** to the end of the lot and **Murder bunnies** back. Then, partners switch.

What is a a crawl bear swing or squat, you ask?

1. Perform a kettlebell swing or a sumo widestance kettlebell squat.
2. Set down the kettlebell on the way down.
3. Move into bear plank position and hold for a beat.
4. Crawl bear hop backwards, with your kettlebell.
5. Stand and repeat, adding a rep to the swing or squat.

## Thang 2 - Kettlebell Mini-Murph

Just to warm up for next Monday...

- 5 KB lawnmower rows, each side (or pullups)
- 10 KB merkins
- 15 squat + rotational press
- Mosey down the field and back

Repeato, I think we hit 5 rounds before running out of time.

## COT

Announcements: **Murph Challenge**

- Next Monday at Olive Chapel Elementary (Hot for Teacher AO).
- It's a tradition to run your murph in honor of a fallen veteran.
- Park at school or across in the Publix complex.
- Theismann will post more details.

Prayers & Praises:

- Praise for all the successful volunteer activities F3 Carpex has stepped up to do lately, like the food bank, highway cleanup, and TCP sawgrass that happened this weekend.
- Praise for Yahoo's family's safe return with Oleg from the Ukraine, and prayers for continued blessings as they adjust to life here.
- Praise for HSM's 2.0's first year at Asheville in the books, and successfully getting an internship (without parental intervention to boot!)

We have a lot to be grateful for, and let's share our blessings with those around us.

Thanks to the Pax for helping me adjust the Q with suggestions on lengths, durations, and substitutions. Not as much mumblechatter, so I'm hoping that means we were too busy working! It was an honor leading you and as always, it pushed me to dig deeper (especially on those haloes!)...MIAGD!
