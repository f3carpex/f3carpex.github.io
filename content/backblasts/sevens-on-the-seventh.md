14 studs met up at Bond Park and didn't let colder than expected temperatures keep them from being awesome and putting in a hour of hard work.

**Warm-Up** Mosey over to the community center parking lot and circle up for imperial walkers, arm twirlies (forward and reverse), copperhead merkins, copperhead squats and Gooooood Mornings.

**The Thang** Mosey to the back of the community center, partner up grab a rock-yo-body sized rock. One partner does AMRAP rock-yo-body, one partner runs half of the parking lot, three rounds each.

Mosey over to the boat house parking lot for four corners. 5 merkins, 10 squats, 15 LBCs, 20 merkins. Repeato in reverse.

Callahan is distracted by the low lake levels, so mosey down to the docks for a round of irkens. No previously sunken treasure or bodies were found.

Mosey up to the shelter for more irkens and dips.

Another round of four corners. 5 copperhead supermans, 10 copperhead merkins, 15 copperhead squats, 20 copperhead supermans.

Mosey over to Kiosk Hill for sevens, dips at the bottom, LBCs at the top.

Mosey back to the Billy Run line, All You Got to the flag.

**Mary** Circle up for low slow flutters, Freddie Mercs, Homer to Marge, Hello Dolly (Hey Gurrrrl), box cutters, Have A Nice Day.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  14 **Name-a-rama**:  2 RESPECT, 11 meh, 1 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Praises for Chanticleer's improving health, prayers for all of our brothers who are dealing with injuries. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS** F3Nation has announced they're putting together a Board of Directors. It has been decided that Callahan is Director of Mumble Chatter, and Liverpool is Assistant To the Director of Mumble Chatter. Congratulations to both.

One of the great things about Phoenix is that it pulls in pax from all over the region. It was great to see some guys for the first time in a while, and to meet new guys Defib and Dr. Evil.

There's a lot of changes happening at Bond Lake. Unconfirmed rumor is they're adding a go-kart track around Carpex Stadium.

In COT I stole an idea from Hello Kitty that he stole from one of our down range regions, and pulled pax #6 into the center of the circle to share what F3 has meant to him. Today's #6 was Callahan. He's an Old School High Impact Man fo sho.

I did not have my A game today, having you men there got me through the morning. Thank you for being there, today and every day. Love you guys!
