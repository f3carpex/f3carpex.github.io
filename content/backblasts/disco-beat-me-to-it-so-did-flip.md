Sunday night planning my Monday morning A-Team Q, I noted on the map that Laurel Park Elementary is super close by. I've been with CARPEx for almost 6 years and have never been to Laurel Park.

"Time for a first," thinks I.

Meet up with Flip Flop and Two Factor for an EC run. Head into the park as per usual but after running the regular long lollipop, Flip takes out of the park and to the right. Right into Laurel Park.

"Well, sheeeeeet," thinks I. "There goes the surprise."

EC run in the bag, time to get back to the flag and at least surprise the other half dozen or so eagerly awaiting PAX. I must have started to talk it all up too much because next thing I know, Frisco and Bootlegger are out!

That's fine... time to take the lucky 9 on an adventure of their lives!

But just as we're getting to the school entrance, someone noted that they were all there just a week ago. With Disco Duck.

"Double sheeeeet," thinks I.
