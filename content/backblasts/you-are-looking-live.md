First-ever (to YHC's knowledge) Instagram story of an entire(ish) beatdown!

Watch it here: [https://www.instagram.com/stories/f3carpex/](https://www.instagram.com/stories/f3carpex/)

- Warm-up: Good morning, merkins, sir fazio and overhead claps, quick feet and curb merkins
- Pearl 1: Rock curls, tricpes, press and rows x2 with a pickle lap in the middle
- Pearl 2: 7 burpees at Burpee Corner
- Pearl 3: Kiwanis Pavilion for LRSU, Dips, LRSU, Table Deadlift
- Pearl 4: Other Pavilion for LRSU, Erkens, LRSU, Derkins
- Pearl 5: To the beach for Merkins, WG Merkins, Diamond Merkins and a Texas Ranger prayer
- Pearl 6: At the kiosk for partner Dora 1-2-3 with the hill at the run
- Pearl 7: Over to the south of NH rock pile for Curls, Triceps, Press and Rows. RegUlar set then a pair of quick sets.
- Pearl 8: Long run back through trail to the lower lot side and then back up to the flag, while moving the 6 to the 12 to lead the way.
- Enough time for a have a nice day.
