14 early birds opted for the latest and greatest 0515 AO ever to grace Carpex with its presence!

As AC/DC's "Back in Black" lit up the airwaves of the Kokabooth parking lot pax began arriving in their themed **black** attire.  Forget tanks.  "Badass Black" all DAY!

The question, "Do we need headlamps?" was presented and quickly laughed off by the 3 co-site Qs.  Yes, 3 site Qs.  Let's meet them:  Hermes - cofounder of FWD, greek god, and headband wearer.  Repeato - virgin site Q, rucker, 9 toenails.  Virgin site Q, rucker, 9 toenails.  Shut-In - temp site Q, angryish.

YHC 3rd-wheeled this launch due to Repeatoe's toe injury.  Now that that is on the mend I'm steppin out, no pun intended.  Hermes was set to co-Q but due to shoulder injury YHC stayed on.  Basically the site Qs together equal one healthy person.  It'll work itself out in the end.

So here's what went down:

\- Dislcaimer

**Repeato** \- Warm Up - Thunderstruck burpees (theme-game is the only thing lit at Back in Black) - Mosey in to Kokabooth - Dora 1-2-3:  Dirkins, Irkins, Jump Squats

**Shut-In** \- Leave The Booth and head to parking lot(s) - Stop for Jack Webb 1 merkin: 4 air presses - Catch Me If You Can:  Backwards run, 10 monkey humpers

\- Pledge of Allegiance

\- Count / Names / Announcements / Prayers / Hermes took us out
