I had originally signed up to Q Half Dome a few weeks ago but had to postpone so I was excited for my first Q here. Usually the hunting grounds of the beige bro tribe, they were nowhere to be found this rainy Thursday. But what we did have was a small and mighty group who came to work. And work they would do.

## Warm-Up

We splished and a splashed our way down Castalia to the second calming circle for a couple of warm-up exercises to, of course, include merkins. I don't remember the other ones because they pale in comparison to merkins. Continue on up the big hill and down to High House where we did a couple of more warm-up exercises.

## The Thang

Mosey down High House to the second entrance to Bond Park. This served as the top of our hill for the Triple Nickel - go to the bottom of the hill (entrance to Jersey Mike's) do 5 burpees, run back up to the top for 5 world's worst merkins. Do that 5 times. 5 exercises at the bottom, 5 at the top, 5x - triple nickels. YHC is 55 so there was a certain symmetry to it.

Disclaimer. We only made it up that hill 4x because we needed to head on back lest YHC gets lambasted by @sabancarpex. However, we completed our 5th hill on the way back, so the Triple Nickel was completed in its entirety.
