YHC got some sad news on Friday that one of my college buddies, Brian Champ, was admitted to ICU at UNC hospitals with a terminal condition. I went to visit him on Sunday morning and it really hit me hard to see him like this; knowing that barring a miracle, he would probably never wake up. It also troubled me a lot that we really hadn't been in contact much over the past decade. So, I decided to dedicated a big part of my A-Team Q to Champ.

**Warmup**

13 HIM gathered in the gloom outside the locked gates of Apex Community Park. I was especially impressed by those who turned up a day after running a half or full marathon. At precisely 5:45, we jogged into the park to the second parking lot for a quick warmup:

SSH, Good Mornings, Hillbillies, Sir Fazio Arm Circles (an A-Team favorite) with Overhead Claps thrown in, and 10 Burpees OYO

**The Thang**

Jogged back toward the entrance to the big parking lot for the CHAMP

Partner up.Â  Partners combine for a total of each exercise. Partner 1 runs around the lot while Partner 2 performs exercises.

C - Crabcakes (50)

H - Hand Release Merkins (100)

A - American Hammers (150)

M - Mountain Climbers (200)

P - Prisoner Squat (250)

On one of the jogs around the lot, I noticed the gate to the soccer field was unlocked and couldn't resist the opportunity to move the fun to the rarely used turf.

Partner 1 - Balls to the Wall; Partner 2 - Run to the end of the field and back (Flapjack X 2)

Split into two groups and Bear Crawl Inch Worm across the field; Lunge Walk Back

Head back out to the parking lot for Mary.

LBCs, Dying Cockroach, Freddy Mercuries, Homer to Marge

COT

**Announcements**

Memorial Day convergence is being planned for Field of Dreams. It may start at 6:30 or 7:00 (or possibly Tuesday), but will include a 2ndF opportunity.

The Bull is happening sometime in the near future

**Prayers**

Obviously, prayers for Champ and his family. Here is a link to a GoFundMe page that was set up for the family.
