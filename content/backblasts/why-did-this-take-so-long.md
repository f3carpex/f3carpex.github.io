Today is Wednesday, March 17. St. Patrick's Day. I led fine men in a workout at MASH on Friday, March 12. I'm just now writing the backblast, and I have no reason why I took this long to do it. However, I'm not going to apologize. I'll just strive to do better next time.

## Warm Up

Easy to remember since most of my warm-ups are basically the same. We took a mosey lap around the parking lot after the Pledge, then circled up for SSHs, Sir Fazio arm circles, Steve Earles, Plank Jacks, Merkins, Runners stretch and Pigeon stretch.

## The Thang

We never left the parking lot. First part of this was Killer Bs inspired - Bear crawl 3 spaces, do 3 burpees, rinse and repeat from one end of the parking lot to the other. At the end of the lot, we did PAX choice Mary exercise as recovery. Then back from where we came - this time Broad Jump 3 spaces, and do 3 Bonnie Blairs. This continued until I ran out of B exercises. We substituted lunge walks as a mode of transport and rotated with bear crawls, because I hate broad jumps. The other exercises included Merkins as well as Jump squats. The finale was a round with bear crawling 5 spaces, then doing 5 Catalina Wine Makers. This was the most popular round by far.

## Mary

Captain Thor until time expired.

## COT

3 Respects, 3 Mehs. YHC took us out in prayer

## NMS

- TClaps to Bonanza for calling Maktar N'Diayes, which reminded YHC of Catalina Wine Makers
- The aerobics class next door provided some music, and enjoyed hearing Dirty Bomb talk loudly about his morning constitutional
- We traveled 0.9 miles in 45 minutes
- Good to see these guys and get better today!
