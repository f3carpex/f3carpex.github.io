I got to sign the flag!! Time to cool it on the BH Qs >.<

 

Smokey was out in front during our warmup run. Killed it today with Honor (we are GOING to effect that change).

 

Sported a shirt that I won at work the other week featuring a design that left a lasting impact:

Aidan was a boy who passed away as the result of Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), and [this foundation](https://www.aidanhasaposse.org/) pushes for newborn screening for the disease. Early detection is the key.

 

So it's cold out here, but not cold enough to avoid the sweat marks.

 

I was so excited to sign the flag that I signed with my hospital initials. Like a strong site Q do, Parker insisted on a re-sign. So AP = JIGZ for you flag trackers out there.

 

Less than a month left as a HATE. Gonna try to soak up every last bit of it! Thank you for the opportunity to lead this morning.
