YHC logged onto Google street view to check the logistics for the Regency loop before Q'ing Krypto for the first time (don't worry, I've posted here more than twice).

A solid group of 11 Pax arrived in the Gloom, some "complaining" that the 42 degrees needed to be a touch warmer. Don't fret, my pet, we'll warm up.

No disclaimer, and we're off onto the Regency Loop which included:

- Warm ups in the first lot (quick feet sorta stuff... high tempo)
- And then we just ran and stopped along the way for stuff including merkins, squats, planks, dips, etc.
- The Pax got to buddy-up and learn a little about their F3 brother. Something about Petsounds and an epic injury on a bike trip to Iceland...
- Burt talked a lot on the loop... should have run faster.
- We cut back around the lake on the way back in.

When back to the lot it was a set of quick pickles for partner LBCs, WWIs, Jump Squats and Merkins.

Finally, as a nod to Hi-Liter's Dad (Navy man) we finished with Boat-Canoes and Airplane Planks.

Thanks for pushing hard boys, great way to start the week. Go out and attack the day w/ an enthusiasm unknown to man.
