On the last Monday in September in 2014, YHC was privileged to be an FNG at an A-Team workout. Today, YHC took the opportunity of his anniversary to repeat his inaugural F3 workout, this time as the Q, just as I did on the last Monday in September 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. Following the first time I participated in this workout (under the leadership of Denali), I couldn’t raise my arms above my head for 3 days and couldn’t walk properly for 6 days. However, on the 7th day, I repeated my attendance at A-Team and have been coming ever since. I can truly say F3 has changed my life. Thanks to all of you.

  
The following is Today’s workout – virtually identical to the past three years.  
30 PAX  (22 PAX in 2018 and 2017, 27 PAX in 2016, 19 PAX and 1 dog in 2015, 7 PAX in 2014) shook off the weekend with an early morning work-out at Apex Community Park. Let’s see what they did:  
– Mosey from the front entrance to the back parking lot  
– Circle up for warm-up (SSH, Good Morning, Mountain Climber, Peter Parker, Low Plank Hold – 3 count around the circle)  
– Mosey to the pavilion (Dips, LR Step-ups, Incline Merkin, Star-jumps – 15 times each) x2  
– Mosey to the tennis courts (11s – Merkins/Star-Jumps)  
– Mary (Do it in the middle of the work-out – Confusion) – LBC, (forgot Low Slow Flutter so we did Freddy Mercury instead), and Dying Cockroach  
– 11s (Prisoner Squats/LBCs)  
– Mosey to the rock pile. Grab a rock. (Curls, Overhead press, and Triceps extensions – 15 each, then 10 each, then 5) –

– We ended the workout with an Indian Run back to the front parking lot followed by 25 WW 2 situps and 15 H2M– just because  
COT – Announcements – Odyssey upcoming October 5  
Prayer Requests – Ducks M – and a few others (don’t delay in typing backblasts)  
YHC took us out in prayer.
