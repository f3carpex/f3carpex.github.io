**Pre-Blast**

- 7 HIM joined YHC at Kryptonite.
- 1 for an EC run -- his name rhymes with smargemouth.
- 1 for EC Bible reading in the car during the EC run -- his name rhymes with shurmeez.

- Once or twice, the PAX needed to be reminded that Kryptonite is a hi-tempo workout.

**The Warmup**

- Pledge of Allegiance at the flag - abbreviated version?
- Run around the lake.
- Circle up for: GM; Extended Plank Series: 200 total reps of MC, PJ, DM, WGM; 100 SSH.

**T****he T****hang**

Partner Up.

Split up, run in opposite directions around the lake. When you meet your partner, perform 20 Burpees. Keep running around the lake, meet back at the start, perform AMRAP Burpees while waiting for the 6.

Perform 20 more Burpees.

Quick 7s on the pine straw hill - Squats and Star Jumps.

Run back to the flag, 100 more Merkins on the way.
