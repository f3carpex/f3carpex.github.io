Wake up to yet another Rainy morning in Cary, seriously!!!! I have signed up for yet another Q  in the rain, but thank God there is a parking deck close to the AO where we can exit the downpour. Check the Radar before heading out, yes the rain is here for the duration of our upcoming beat down. Put on the rain jacket and head to BO and surprisingly there are 7 warriors there to meet me, under the eave of the building across the street. Someone suggests we head to the parking deck by the Police station, my thoughts exactly, so we head over to the parking deck to start our work out.

**Warm Up**

- SSH x 20
- Good mornings x 20
- Imperial Walkers x 20
- Std Mericans x 20
- Plank Jacks x 20

**The Thang**

Run up the parking deck adding anther exercise of increasing number at each level, in the following order:

- 5 Burpees
- 10 WW2 Situps
- 15 Jump Squats
- 20 Std. Mericans
- 25 Plank Jacks
- 30 LBC

Come back down the lot, stopping at each level to complete the entire series of exercises, in the opposite order.

Drop off one exercise at each level of decent ending with 30 LBCs.

**Mary**

- Sprint up one level, American Hammers x 20, sprint back. Somehow lost Callahan on this series, but he did suddenly appear from the stairwell at the end.
- Sprint up one level, Box Cutters x 20, sprint back.

**COT**

Decided to do our COT in the deck so we could sit down without getting our butts wet.

Shared a Scripture from the Sermon on the Mount: Matthew 6: 31-34

"31 So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ 32 For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. 33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. 34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."

Every day is filled with enough things to worry about, so we need to trust God for our provision for the future. If we put Him first he is always faithful to provide all of our needs day by day.

 

It was a pleasure to be honored to lead these fine men today.
