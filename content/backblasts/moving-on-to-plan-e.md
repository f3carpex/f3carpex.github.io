Have I told you how sick I am of cold, rainy weather? Luckily today we were expecting highs to get into the 60s. With sunshine. WITH SUNSHINE!!!

However this morning, it was still 30s and the ground was wet from rain we've had in the past 1,231 hours.

Six for EC run of about 3 miles. Return to the flag, and I initially thought I was in the wrong place. Maybe I should post at DTP a little more often - apparently it's now the place to be in Downtown Apex on Tuesdays at 0530.

First exercise, Pledge of Allegiance

## Warm Up

Mosey through downtown to the huge parking lot at Apex Baptist. Circle for SSHs, Good Mornings, Sir Fazio arm circles, Steve Earles, Plank Jacks, and 25 Merkins.

Jack Webbs up to 10:40

## The Thang

Mosey to Cemetary Hill. 7s with PAX choice of exercises - Steaks' Star Jumps and Burpees

Once complete, we're now gonna use the hill back toward downtown for another set of PAX choice 7s. PAX chose Burpees and Bonnie Blairs

Mosey back to the flag, except we need to pause at Apex Baptist to 1., PUT6, and 2., do 10 burpees because Henny Penny tried to sneak in late.

Continue mosey to the flag.

## Mary

Dying Cockroaches, American Hammers, HAND

## COT

3 Hates, quite a few Respects, and a whole slew of mouthy Mehs. 31 in total, counting Triple Lindy who needed to leave promptly at 5:48. YHC took us out in prayer.

## NMS

- Yes, 31 on a regular ol' Tuesday. PROBLEMATIC. Our 1st F Qs really need to do something!
- Steaks is very adamant that proper form be used on Star Jumps. PAX did well this morning.
- TClaps to Prodigal for making sure the PAX stayed busy
- Nice try Henny Penny! I gotta give you an A for effort.
- Got JUST over 3 miles, a solid traveling effort as I promised Squatter. Don't @ me!
- Solid fellowship this morning. Solid group of HIMs. Keep accelerating, and keep improving JUST A LITTLE every day.
