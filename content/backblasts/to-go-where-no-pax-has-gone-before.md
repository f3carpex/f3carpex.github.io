It's probably because of spring break week. Yes, definitely spring break. Lot's of people out of town. But could it be the weather? Less likely but possible. I know some of the Carpex PAX have been, shall I say, a bit disappointed in the lack of resilience from their brothers when it comes to posting in less-than-ideal weather.

Could it be ME? Could YHC be the reason for the low numbers this morning at the premier 0530 start, standard boot camp at Olive Chapel Elementary school? Affectionately known as Hot For Teacher (and starting a pretty impressive run of EXCELLENT AO names. I mean - the newest is Cougar Town! C'mon, that's awesome!!!). There's no way I'm the reason for the low numbers. NO.WAY.

Seven studs, undeterred by obstacles mere mortals allow to stand in their way, were at the shovel flag at 0530. Disclaimer and pledge, and as promised feet begin moving.

## Warm Up

Mosey across the street to the circle by F45. Time to show these folks what's up. Sir Fazio arm circles, Runner's stretch, Calf stretch, Steve Earles, and 10 wall jump burpees OYO.

## The Thang

Mosey to the sidewalk adjacent Kelly Road. Pearls on a string, allowing PAX to call exercises on our way to the Beaver Creek shopping center. Exercises included Squats, Flutter kicks, CDDs, and Hill Billys. Once at the parking lot at Beaver Creek, do one round of Jack Webbs. Mosey back to the flag, and unwind the string. Stop back by the same F45 circle to show them how to do 10 more wall jump burpees.

## Mary

Captain Thor up to 8:32, out of time.

## COT

3 Respects, 4 Mehs. Announcements, praises and prayer requests taken. YHC took us out.

## NMS

- We visited the very spot where DBB was born. First uttered, as PAX needed some tough love. The legacy lives on.
- To my knowledge no one has taken the voyage to Beaver Creek at the HFT main event. Long overdue.
- Tank Top Thursday was not being observed by most PAX. Where was Chicken Little?
- MIAGD! and be a little bit better than you were yesterday
