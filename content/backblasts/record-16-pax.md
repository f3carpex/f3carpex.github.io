The night was looking to be a very glorious time for a beatdown! Many other pax thought so too as 16 HIMs in all descended upon Ragnarok to tackle the evening gloom, which we were all pretty sure set a new record for the site!

When the clock hit 8pm YHC gave, and slighty bumbled my way through the disclaimer and mission of F3 (It was one of a few times I realized I was a little rusty). After getting through it and reciting the Pledge we were off running around the parking loop.

_**Warm Up:**_

- **Good Evening**
- **SSH**
- **Sir Fasio Arm Circles**
- **Windmills**
- **Plank Jacks**
- **Calf Stretches**

_**Thang 1:**_

We formed two lines and did an **Indian Run** all the way to the parking area by the baseball field.

_**Thang 2:**_

At a specific part of the parking lot we did the **WMD Crawl** (5 Wide Merkins, 10 Bear Crawl Steps, 5 Merkins, 10 Steps, 5 Diamond Merkins, 10 Steps, Repeat) all the way to the end of the lot.

_**Thang 3:**_

Going back the way we came we did **Lt. Dans** (Ascending ratio of 1 Squat:2 Lunges). Keep going till you reach 10 Squats:20 Lunges. We knocked out an ab exercise while we waited for everyone to finish.

_**Thang 4:**_

Ascending and Descending **Burpees** at each of the 10 light poles going back to the starting spot. (Count went like this: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1).

_**Thang 5:**_

This is where it started getting a little chaotic, but we made it! Count off 1’s and 2’s for a round **7’s**. 1’s started off with 6 **Pullups** and 2’s started with 1 **Copperhead Squat**. Everyone finished at roughly the same time.

_**Mary:**_

**LBCs**

**Dying Cockroaches**

**Straight Arm American Hammers**

**Surtur’s 100’s**

**Stretching**

**COT**

_**Announcements:**_

Piranha Park had their soft launch this past Saturday

_**Prayers/Praises:**_

There was a couple of prayers that were lifted up.

YHC took us out.

**NMS:**

Once again it was an honor to lead the big group of HIMs that came out, including some I hadn’t seen in awhile. Great job gents!
