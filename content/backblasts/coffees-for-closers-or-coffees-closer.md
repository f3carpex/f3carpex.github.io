_Even as I type this back blast, Prodigal is still doing LBCs…_

For quite some time now, my Tuesday morning coffeeteria involves driving from Disturbing the Peace in downtown Apex to WZ by Full Metal Jacket and joining up with the already established fellowship taking place. It’s hard breaking into that camping chair circle when you arrive late, so the only way to beat ‘em, is to join ‘em. Not to mention, I drive by FMJ just to get to DTP, so when Orphan threw out the bat signal for people to step up and Q, it was a no brainer. Being that close to coffee is just too good to pass up.

Checked for friendly new guys and seeing none, we did the pledge of allegiance and headed out for a mosey across the street to the back parking lot of the church for warm up.

**Warm Up**

\-Crimson Good Mornings (one rep, hold and moan)

\-While in CGM, Michael Phelps

\-Smurf (Burt) Jacks

\-Plank with Annies

\-Dive Bombers

\-Calf Stretch

Short mosey to the front parking lot of the church for…

**Thang 1**

Suicide Merkins: Run 80% of pace to first median, 5 merkins and mosey back. Repeat adding 5 merkins each round to all 5 medians.

Mosey back to school main entrance. Pointed out to the PAX where the top of the hill, middle and bottom was (Squatter is still confused).

**Thang 2**

AMRAP Hill with core exercise at the bottom, 1 Squat Jump + L/R Bonnie Blair five times each time you pass through the middle, and merkin exercise at the top. PAX that finish each round early would run loops at the bottom until the six was in.

Round 1: LBCs (bottom) and Hand-release Merkins (top)

Round 2: Low Slow Flutters (bottom) and Sherkins aka Shoulder-tap Merkins (top)

Round 3: Leg Lifts (bottom) and Curbkins (top)

Checked the watch, made sure mileage minimum was hit and enjoyed a mosey back up the hill to the flag. Have a nice day!

Announcements: Odyssey this Saturday (10/24), TCP landscaping day (11/1), hard launch of Off the Rails, downtown Apex Saturday AO (10/31) and Orphan encouraged PAX to find a non-profit to financially support.

Prayers/Praises: None were spoken and YHC took us out.
