It was great to serve as co-Q with Riptide for about a year and half and then another year or so with Kitty, but it was definitely time to pass the torch. BO is in great hands with Prodigal and Press On

Hope the PAX enjoyed the attempt to try to hit some of the iconic areas of BO for our swan song. Intended to hit the rock pile as well as the Arts Center for rail crawls, but there just wasn’t enough time.

I knew Burt would grumble about the pain sticks.

Speaking of Burt, continued thanks to Becky for her support of TTT in the laundry department. All participated in TTT, with The Joker having an asterisk by his name.

Shut-In beamed in a la Captain Kirk at the Fountain. We did penalty burpees. Thank you Duck for the reminder (think it was Duck)

Props to Skipper for his first non-limited run Boot Camp.

Several Kotters including Macho Man, Red Lobster and Silverback (back from injury). Great to see all of these guys.

7 for Duck Donuts and all of its gloriousness
