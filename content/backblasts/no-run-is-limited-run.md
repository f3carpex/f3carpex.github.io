YHC decided to embrace the limited run mantra completely with a zero-run workout. Movement between Thangs was done at a walking pace and only long enough to slightly drop HR.

Warm up was a fairly standard one: Good Morning, Side Straddle Hop, Down Dog, Sir Fazio, Windmill, Hillbilly, Calf Stretch

Thang 1:  
PAX all circle up, and an "active" and "active recovery" exercise are called. Ascending ladder of 1-2-3-4 reps of the active exercise, one PAX at a time, moving around the circle. All other PAX AMRAP active recovery.

Jump Squat / Squat Pulse  
Merkin / Superman Pulse  
Shoulder tap / High Plank  
Boat-Canoe / Hundreds

Thang 2:  
Partner up. One Partner holds chill cut while the other does agility jumps over his feet, from side-to-side (20 count). Alternate positions, then repeato.

Thang 3:  
Descending ladder from Thang 1: 4-3-2-1 reps of active work bring us around the circle four times. Most PAX are at failure on the active recovery excercise.

Thang 4:  
Balls-to-the-wall and people's chair hold, with each PAX providing a 10 count down the line.
