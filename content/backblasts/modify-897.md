I have to admit, if I wasn't Q'ing today I am not sure I would have made it out of the fartsack. I had originally planned to Q Dante's Peak this week but Parker requested the spot for his birthday celebration so I picked up FC instead. I wasn't too thrilled with my decision this morning while driving to the finest AO in NW Cary today in the rain. It is a great spot with a solid group of regulars so definitely worth the trip.

Last night while preparing, I was reviewing the exercise options and found a few ideas. I choose three good options but since we didn't have time to do all three I decided to modify each of them. More on that later.

5 HIMs completed a 2 mile EC run. I did not (it was raining!).

At 5:45 sharp we were off. Quick jog to the middle school parking lot for the warm up.

**Warm Up:**

- 15 x SSH
- 5 x Good Mornings
- 10 x Windmills (Since Franklin wasn't happy with the limited GMs)
- 10 x Merkins

Enough with the warm up, off to the elementary school track.

**Thang 1: The Cooper!**

I decided to bring back a fan favorite with the cooper. Modified to start at 8 instead of 10. Q instructed the PAX to start at 8 then do 9 then 7. Franklin asked for clarification and the Q repeated the same instructions. YHC noticed the confused looks and realized I was not fully awake and clarified start and 8 then 7 then 6 down to 1. When finished run the stairs while you wait.

**Thang 2: Red Barchetta**

Mosey to the soccer field for a modified Red Barchetta. Had it not been raining I would have provided the associated Rush song. May next time.

- Run to the end of the field, 40 SSH return and hold for the six.
- Run to 3/4 of the field, 30 Mountain Climbers return and hold for the six.
- Run to half field, 20 Plank Jacks return and hold for the six.
- Run to 1/4 of the field, 10 Merkins return and hold for the six.
- 5 Burpees OYO

Mosey back to the sidewalk.

**Thang 3: Route 36**

Route 36 is the modified Route 66. Starting at 1 Merkin per light pole go up to 6 then backÂ  down to 1. 1-2-3-4-5-6-5-4-3-2-1 gives you 36. If you go from 1-11 it makes 66.

Since we had a few extra minutes, head to the basketball court for some BTTW and Bear Crawls.

Return to the parking lot for Mary.

**Mary**

- Liverpool - Protractor
- YHC - LBC
- Goose - Box Cutter
- Ma Bell - Copperhead Merkins
- Have a nice day!

**COT**

- Prayers for Swag's M and treatment course
- Praises for YHC's sister-in-law not having thyroid cancer

**NMS**

- Admittedly, YHC was struggling today. Glad Franklin was able to assist.
- We should all be thankful that we can get up each day and work out together.
- We missed Frisco. Maybe not :)
- Crimson is back next week!
