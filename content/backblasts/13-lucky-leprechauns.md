Q: Hotspot

13 Lucky Leprechauns met on a crisp 24 degree morning to bring the luck of the Irish upon them.  There was an announcement the previous evening that those without green would learn the lesson with penalty burpees.  Well as it turned out, all were taught the penalty burpee lesson regardless of attire.  YHC did appreciate those that tried to accommodate the request for festive attire.  

**Warmup** **which was really needed**

- One Lap around Complex (.4 miles for those complaining/cheering what have you...) YHC was still trying to warm up the ole noggin to remember what was next.  In the future run faster.

- Good Mornings x 20 (IC)

For the Firefighters and people impacted by the 5-alarm fire on Glenwood (downtown) Raleigh last night.

As well, for all the runners participating in the TRM26 and TRM13 on Sunday.  May they run swiftly, safely and without injury.

**Naked Moleskin**

This was YHC’s first official solo (full) Q and the pax mostly were forgiving of the frozen brain blunders.  Nerves were high, but the frozen tundra quickly calmed and YHC went on with the beatdown.  YHC appreciated all mumble chatter during, and fed off it, working hard to keep everyone moving at a good clip to stay warm.  Thank you for being there, we got stronger, and YHC got to grow in outside of the comfort zone.  SYITG
