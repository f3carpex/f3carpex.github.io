My M had a hair appointment after the babies' bedtime last night... which offered the perfect opportunity to knock out some laundry and catch up on podcasts. Last week's call that was on the F3 Nation podcast featured Olive's testimony. As I was listening to that, I saw Pet Sounds' call for a Q-sub. Having navigated that course last week - and having vision cast from a recorded phone conference - I quickly saw a plan come together.

 

After some failed terrain recon (sub 30 gloom after recent rain was not the time to explore unpaved areas), I rolled up 15 seconds late to kick it off:

 

No FNGs / Welcome to our new DR friend / LET'S GO

 

Mosey west to the middle of the large parking lot for the first warmup:

Continue the mosey west to the greenway entrance for warmup #2:

 

T Merkin x 10

One arm Merkin x 10

Turkish Getup x 10

Hillbilly x 10

 

Thang #1

2 groups of 3 for a Partner Carry-Catch Me If You Can to the fence by the Amphitheater... nay, simply to the lake. 1 carrys 2, 3 does 5 burpees and runs to catch 1 & 2. Cycle through until the lake. Mosey back along the lake to KBA.

 

Mosey up the hill back into the parking lot for

 

Thang #2

The breakout hit Pick Up the 6 pushed me to check out the F3 Nation Podcast (43 Feet and associated calls). There are no words to describe how funny the whole Funni Bonz phenomenon is to me... a great meme for Hello Kitty's belt for sure. Nevertheless, hearing **[Olive's story on last week's call](https://soundcloud.com/f3nation/olive-talks-ost)** was awesome. Please take a listen and educate yourself on **[Myocarditis](https://www.myocarditisfoundation.org/)**. Sobering message there.

 

Speaking of sobering messages, if'n you haven't read yesterday's **[Muggo](https://themuggo.com/2018/12/05/gibsons-story/)**, and are somehow on this page nonetheless, please take a peek. This story is a huge part of the history of Carpex and Raleigh - so many of us have been blessed by CD's willingness to share his experiences and walk with other hurting PAX.

 

Two days in a row posting with Frisco. I think I actually like that guy! Nice work carrying my 200lb self down a dark and winding path, that's a big ask.

 

This was fun... and I hopefully have a plan cooking for a future BiB/Krypto Q. Maybe even a place to venture from SWW.
