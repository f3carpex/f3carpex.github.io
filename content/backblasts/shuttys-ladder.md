YHC had an amazing beatdown planned for the tennis courts of Claymore this morning, but overnight rains left the courts way too slippery. So instead the boys of Carpex got this.

**Warm-Up** Mosey around the pickle to the rock pile and circle up for Imperial Walkers, Sir Fazios, cherry pickers, and the opposite of copperhead merkins (name TBD).

**The Thang** Grab a travelling rock from the rock pile for travelling rock sevens. Six merkins at the rock pile, walk the pickle counter clockwise while doing rock curls, one rock squat, walk the pickle clockwise while doing overhead rock presses, etc.

Gently place your rock where you found it and mosey to the lopsided side of the parking lot. Our nantanner Shut-in (some say he's the best nantanner in all of F3 Nation) complained recently that we don't do Jacob's Ladder enough. The lopsided parking lot is as close to a hill as we have at Claymore, so it'll have to do. Bear crawl across the parking lot and do one curb merkin, mosey back, repeato with two curb merkins, etc until we hit seven curb merkins.

Back to the rock pile for an ego rock and two trips around the circle with each PAX calling a rock exercise.

**Mary** Back to the flag with just enough time for burpees, Good Morning (one count, Crimson style) and Have A Nice Shawshank.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  7 **Name-a-rama**:  1 RESPECT, 5 meh, 1 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for Burt, Becky and all of those dealing with Covid, praises for Hello Kitty's M on her birthday. **BOM**:  YHC took us out **NMS**  Mid 30's and rain, perfect Duck Weather.

How does Parker recover from an ankle injury? By doing a solo EC run in a weighted vest.

I asked Frisco for a ten count and he nailed it!

Press On was not there, but was mentioned and missed.

We're still working on a name for the opposite of Copperhead Merkins. YHC called them Copperfoot Merkins, Hello Kitty suggested Mongoose Merkins, and Parker said Honey Badger Merkins. We'll settle this on slack.

Love you guys!
