Saw the Q-sheet was open and wanted to do a BRR-style Q with the added bonus of trolling the FMJ PAX on Slack for predictably "running in circles" at the track. Much respect to those guys I wouldn't be able to keep up.  
  
The POGL has some awesome hills and a little bit of elevation checking on topographical maps pointed to my two favorites. Hinton St and W Moore St (aka Cemetery Hill). Planned two Triple Nickels on MapMyRun (I cannot afford Strava), and looked like it would fit in the time we had. Woke up early to get cinder blocks from Hell's Bells for manmakers, parked at the bottom of cemetery hill, and caught Yahoo and Flenderson for a quick ruck.

### Warmup

Warmup at the flag.  
\- Side straddle hops  
\- Imperial Walkers  
\- Seal Claps  
Pledge of Allegiance

### Thang 1: Triple Nickel - Hinton Street Hill

Mosey to Hinton Street. Split up with part of the PAX running up Hinton Street and the others running back up Saunders.  
  
5x up the hill  
Top - 5x diamond merkins  
Bottom - 5x Bobby Hurleys

### Thang 2: Triple Nickel - Cemetery Hill

Mosey to Cemetery Hill  
5x up the hill  
Top - 5x squats  
Bottom - 5x manmakers w/ cinder blocks  
  
The plan was five times up, but a watch check made we think we didn't have enough time. We actually would have. I should trust my planning a little more next time. Mosey back to flag with an all you got through the alley behind Anna's pizza. Followed by 51 WW2's and some Broga.

### COT
