Overnight storms left the Ritter Park area wet and slippery, let's see if we can make it through the beatdown with no injuries.

**Warm-Up** Mosey across Kildaire Farm Road to the Retail Section and circle up for Good Mornings, imperial walkers, Sir Fazios, copperhead squats, copperhead merkins and three slippery mountain climbers.

**The Thang** Mosey down to the greenway, through the tunnel and up to the top of the ramp. The lucky number of nails in a horseshoe is seven, so we'll make seven horseshoes. Mosey down the ramp, through the tunnel, and up the other ramp, with descending burpees starting at seven.

Mosey back to the Retail Section for Triangles. Five Carolina dry docks at one corner, ten at the next corner, fifteen back at the corner where we started. Repeato with monkey humpers and hillbillies.

Mosey back to shelter at the park and grab some bench for 50 dips, 50 irkins and 50 step-ups.

**Mary** Table top LBCs, Freddie Mercs, dying cock-a-roaches, Have A Nice Day.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  16 **Name-a-rama**:  3 RESPECT, 13 meh, 0 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for Yahoo, his M and the young boy they are adopting, prayers for the volunteers and attendees at the Night to Shine at Hope Community Church **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**  

YHC kept himself and the rest of the pax relatively dry this morning, despite all the puddles left over from the storms the night before. Mary was in the shelter, and since there were even wet spots there, we finished on the tables. Your welcome for my leadership.
