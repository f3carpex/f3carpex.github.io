Insomnia

#TheStandard, the original, the ever popular Insomnia kicked off the morning. There was even an FNG, EH'd by our bro Flacco. Due to his first post being Insomnia Callahan (the amazing Site Q) hit him with the disclaimer and we were off for a reverse Davis Drive loop...come to Insomnia to learn what that route is.

**Insomnia Runners:** Callahan, Chinese Downhill, FNG, Flacco, Ollie, Shut-In

"THE SIX" also ran their own Thang. Strava called it "Not The Maynard". It was 11 or so miles. But the real news was only 4 showed up!?!? Is there a crack in the team!!?? 2 Summit Church members did not participate. Were they at a revival all night? Who knows, who knows... \*Also note Callahan was invited but politely declined\*

**Not The Maynard Runners:** Largemouth, Squatter, Chanticleer, Michelob

Vesper

**3.5 MILERS:** We ran Right on High House, Left into Weatherstone, Right out of Weatherstone, Right on High House, Left to Bond Park

**4.5 MILERS:** We ran Right on High House, Left into Weatherstone, Right out of Weatherstone, Left onto the greenway, Left On Maynard, Right on High House, Left to Bond Park. A figure 8 on #StravaArt

**5 MILERS:** YHC was not a part of that group. Assuming they did the "Hotspot 5".

**Welcome FNG, Half Baked!** He's from Vermont and so is Ben and Jerry's (and Riptide had naming rights so....)
