It is hard to believe that 2017 was 5 years ago but alas here we are celebrating my 5 years of doing this thing we call F3. I am still not sure why I started in January since I really do not like cold but so glad I decided to join Crimson all those years ago. A little known fact is I did not start posting regularly until early March 2017 frequently using the too cold excuse.

Much to my surprise 20 HIMs joined YHC at Apex Hunter Street Park at 5:30 to celebrate my 5 year anniversary. It was 23 degree with some bone chilling wind so I was hopeful that at least a few showed up. It was a solid mix of my core group of PAX, the BH regulars, and a strong showing from the SLT as well.

5:30 arrived, time for a quick review of the mission and the Pledge and we were off.

Mosey to the parking lot by the ball field for:

- SSH
- Good Mornings
- Quick Sir Fazios
- Some stretching
- A few Control Freak Merkins (thanks Crimson!)

Thang 1:

Mosey to the edge of the school parking lot. Run down 5 lights poles and back, stopping to do 5 reps of each exercise each time. The first three exercises were inspired by Egon's pre-blast the night before.

- Diamond Merkins
- Copperhead Squats
- Burpees
- Mountain Climbers
- Plank Jacks

That ended up being nearly 2 miles of light poles!

Thang 2:

Mosey back to the ball field parking lot for 3 sets of 9 supermans in honor of this being 1/27. (3 x9 = 27, see what I did there to keep my theme)

Mosey back to the flag.

Mary:

- American Hammers
- Homer to Marge
- LBC
- Freddie Mercs
- Dying Cockroaches (thanks Two Factor!)

COT

- SLT introduced themselves and reviewed their role in the shared leadership team
- YHC talked about the importance of small group connectedness to make the large group stronger.

NMS:

- Special thanks to Crimson for his continued support and encouragement.
- Shout outs to Deuce, Bootlegger, Intimidator, and Two Factor for their constant support.
- Thanks to my invited special guests Hotspot (named me) and Parker (I named Parker at my VQ)
- What we have is special. Not because of me or you but because we are doing this thing call life together! Can't wait to see whats in store for 2022!
