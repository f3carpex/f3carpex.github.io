It was another fine Friday morning.  Today, Hello Kitty joined regulars Michelob, Squatter, and YHC for the 2.5 mile EC run into DP. We were greeted by an additional 13 men before we began the main event. YHC reminded the PAX that his right wing was still not 100%, so we’d be exercising our running shoes.
