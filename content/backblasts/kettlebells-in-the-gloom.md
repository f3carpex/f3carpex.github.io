YHC a little groggy this morning after a great SB and had not planned much for this edition of Hell’s Bell’s.  We drag the bell’s into the shelter, and, coming in hot is Monkey Nut.  He brings the 45lb pain while we distribute the rest of the bells on the tables.  Sooey, my faithful timekeeper, says it is time so we head out, this time towards the basketball courts because the other way is a big mess with all the work Cheddar Bo is doing for our new fields.  It does looks like they are getting ready to open the fields hopefully they will not lock us out.  We head to the top of the hill and circle up for:

## Warm Up

Good mornings

Overhead Claps

Cotton Pickers

Sir Fazio Arm Thingies

## The Thang

Done with the warm-up, we head back to the shelter where we had previously dropped the kettlebells to begin the impact workout.  Q takes the two 45lb weights and puts them on the sidewalk, then announces a different workout per station for each us.  One of the HIM is going to farmer carry the two weights down the path while the rest of the HIM perform the first round (all done OYO):

Kettlebell swings

Curls

Around the World

Goblet Squats

Tri-cep Extensions

Overhead Presses

We rotate positions and exercises once the farmer carry returns until everyone has had a turn with the farmer carry.   We then mosey to the basketball courts and back for a break and start in on the next round of farmer carry and the following exercises:

Kettlebell swings, one arm

Lawn Mowers

Curls

Halos

Nut cracker squats

Squats with the medicine ball

Once the farmer carry is done, we mosey once more to the basketball courts and back for a quick round of pick-your-own exercises and a shorter distance of farmer carry.

With five minutes to spare (thanks again to Sooey for the timekeeping), we each grab a kettlebell and circle up for:

## Mary

Mary with a kettlebell is a little different as you are generally holding the bell during the workout.  Mary included:

WW2 sit-ups on the up

Freddie Mercuries in cadence

Big Boy Situps

Dying cockroach

LBCs in cadence

Merkins on the bell

Bell tolls 6:15 and time to finish.
