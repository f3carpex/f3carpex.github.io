Given the significance of the concept of a Sad Clown in the F3 universe, one could think the name Flying Circus to be a bit, well, curious.  Given the madness that went down at this AO on Thursday, August 23, 2018, I think the name fits.

18 HIM pledged their allegiance to the flag, and then moseyed to the basketball courts.

**Warm Up**

- Good Mornings, nice and slow
- 2 x FNGs show up
- 10 Burpees OYO
- Hill Billies
- Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson arms: Circles front and backwards like Sir Fazio, except one arm at a time.  Then we push the water forward, push the water back, all in cadence.
- Overhead claps x 10
- Plank Jacks x 10
- Merkins x 10 on my down AND my up

**Thang 1**

Number off 1s and 2s.  1s do BTTW while 2s bear crawl the length of the basketball court, mosey back and then flip flop.

**Thang 2**

The Half Shelden Cooper

Mosey to the track.  Run a half lap, then complete:

- 10 Merkins
- 10 Burpees
- 10 Squats
- 10 WWII situps

After complete, run another half lap and complete 9 each of aforementioned exercises.  Continue until you've done them all.

**Thang 3**

Mosey back to the basketball court and repeat Thang 1.

**Mary**

- 10 Burpees OYO to calm Pet Sounds
- Have a Nice Day

**COT**

- 4 Respects, 1 Hate, 15 Mehs
- Welcome FNGs Sudafed & Tiny Tim
- Remember the Q School next week, VQ week in October, Carpex Anniversary at DZ on 8/31, and the 9/11 Stair Climb.  Check Slack for details
- Prayers for Disco's M, McCants continued healing, and the outbreak of fire ants in Carpex
- YHC took us out.

**NMS**

- Our FNGs really got after it today.  They were well prepared with water bottles, which I think were still there when we got back to the basketball court following the Half Cooper.  I think they'll be back.
- Biner smiled a little.
- Nice work making sure we picked up the 6 today.
- Back to the Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson arms.  That's actually an adaptation of Gwyneth Paltrow arms that my M showed me from the FIA workouts.  The Rock sounds better, but the PAX were dropping like flies before YHC called recover.
- This workout included Merkins, Burpees and Bear Crawls.  That is as close to perfection as God allows on earth.

It was a pleasure to lead this fine group.  Be a little better today than you were yesterday.
