**9/5/2017**

This was a co-Q with Free bird and Nature Boy today at FOD.

Driving into the Q it was apparent we were really close to a full moon, so hopes were high.  Upon further review, it was only 99% full on a waxing gibbous.  (Full moon on September 6th)  I don't pretend to know anything about the phases of the moon but I knew if that was my intro, some useful facts may be beneficial.  Good website on the moon.  http://www.moongiant.com/phase/today/

The usual suspects showed up for this Western Cary post today.  The Pax were very calm coming off vacation in my opinion.  NO MURPH!
