YHC was up early this morning, looking forward to a Beaker Beatdown. Unfortunately Beaker was under the weather and needed someone to pick up his Q, and since YHC was the only other person awake at 4 AM, it was all mine.

**Beaker's Back-up's Beginnings (The Warm-up)**

Mosey over to the parking lot next to the hill and circle up for side straddle hops, cotton pickers, hillbillies, copperhead merkins and copperhead squats.

**Beaker's Back-up's Beatdown (The Thang)**

Indian run to the main parking lot, then all you got to the pickle. Partner up for Beaker's Bearcrawls. One partner bearcrawls the pickle counter-clockwise while the other runs the pickle clockwise. Flapjack when you meet, repeato until you've completed one trip around the pickle.

Stay with your partner for Beaker's Burpees (aka Dora 1-2-3 and a half). Partners combine for 100 merkins, 200 squats, 300 LBCs and 50 burpees, one partner does exercises while the other runs the pickle.

All you got to the other side of the parking lot, then Indian run to the parking lot next to the entrances.

**Beaker's Back-up's Bellies (The Mary)**

PAX took turns calling Mary exercises, including one-legged Homer-to-Marge, American hammers, box cutters, cox butters, copperhead merkins (Ma Bell, natch), and low slow flutters (Crimson, despite YHC clearly mouthing the words "Have A Nice Day").

**Beaker's Back-up's Benediction (The COT)**

**Count-a-rama**:  11 **Name-a-rama**:  3 RESPECTs, 7 meh, 1 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for Beaker's recovery from sickness, prayers for Ascot's M and 2.0 recovering from a virus, praises for Hot Spot's 2.0 enjoying the weekend with her school band winning a competition. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**Beaker's Back-up's BS (The NMS)**

YHC was telling Beaker just last week I hadn't been to one of his Q's lately, but I still enjoy his backblasts. I hope this was a marginally adequate replacement.

There were plans to do something on Powerline Hill, but when I walked over there pre-workout I saw two baby copperheads. So no hill work today.

But we did copperhead merkins and squats. See what I did there?

It's still warm enough for snakes to be active, but already dark enough that it's hard to see them. Be careful where you stick your face and butt.

No complaining about the Beaker Bearcrawls this morning, I've been to workouts where he called them around a circle much bigger than that one.

We missed you this morning Beaker, feel better brother.
