Bolton's son is a VANNS guy, so even though he doesn't understand the reference, we named him Spicoli. Immediately after being named, he responded with "You got anything better?" Later when asked if he had a good time he replied "No."

YHC took us out with a quote from Thomas Jefferson

> "When the people fear the government we have tyranny. When the government fears the people we have liberty."
