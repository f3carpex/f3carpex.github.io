QIC: Fluoride

+6 Awesome Pax

I arrived at Koka Booth barely on time to find 6 Pax running in the parking lot. I got out of my car and asked why they were running, and the reply was to keep warm. It was that kind of morning, in the low 40's and raining, a day when most folks would elect to fartsack, but not the brave men of Carpex. I decided to modify my planned workout, and do some work under the shelter at the Amphitheater, so we were off down the trail to get out of the rain. Alas some yin-yang decided to lock the gate this morning, so it was back to the parking lot in the rain.

**Warmup**

- SSH x 20
- Good Mornings x 15
- Imperial walkers x 15
- Std. merikans x 20

 

**The Thang**

Run up to Ederly Dr. take a right up the hill.

Before the hill stop at the guard rail for a set of :

- Dips x 20, 30 and 40
- Irkins x 20, 30 and 40

Just before we got to our first stop, just as we were getting warm, some kind driver decided to hit a puddle right next to the side walk and soak all of us. The people of Cary are just sooo kind.

Head on up the hill to the parking lot for:

A set of double 7's down both sides of the parking lot:

Set 1: Jump Squats 6-1, Burpees 1-6

Set 2: Jump Lunges 6-1, Diamond Mericans 1-6.

We started off with a set of double 11's until we ran the first hill and realized this was not  an hour workout, thank God for the Audible.

Finished this up just in time to get back to the flag, 1 min late, no time for Mary.

Strong work by everyone this morning, especially good to see Wilbur join us. Didn't have my GPS but Chanticleer says we got in 4.0 miles.

As always it was a great honor to lead these men this morning. It takes a real commitment to turn out for a morning like today for a workout in the elements. Thankfully the rain did subside and we managed to stay halfway dry.

You guys Rock,

Fluoride
