_Goal: Have fun and do some stupid stuff._

The stupid stuff started early: The first thing that you should do when you Q is to show up early.  
YHC made the site Q's anxious by showing up at 5:29ish - it all started El Crappo.

Disclaimer in broken Spanish at 5:31:  
_Buenos dia hermanos  
Este esse effe tres  
FNG? No? OK.  
Yo no es professionale  
Y yo no tengo dinero  
Via con velocidad de tu y no muerte  
Pero accelleramos con su hermanos  
Si? Si!_

**Warmup**  
Mozy to side of church for warmup  
SSH x qunice  
Senor Crimson takes over while YHC goes to set up like I should have done if I had arrived early.  
(I assume that Crimson called Good Mornings, something else, and Sir Fazio Arm Circles F/B)

**Announcements**  
VHS is hosting Sparta 300- a 60th BDay event Saturday at AO Phoenix  
  
**Prayers**  
Yogi's 2.0 is 2 weeks past her due date. They need that baby to arrive ASAP.  
Bubba's getting PSA results today and is unsure about them - but he's in God's hands.

**NMS**  
Gracias to Spanish teacher Shortcut for his appreciation of my use of Spanish 1 and laughing at that I added 'O' to everything to make it a Spanish word... just like his students.  
Lo siento to WWW for causing him some grief by arriving so late.  
Gracias tambien to Crimson for leading the warmup while I set up the cinco stations.  
Heard somewhere in the middle of El Thingo "**Embraco el sucko!**"  
  
I thank Dios for Los muchachos that posted today. All fine HIM who pushed each other to finish strong those burpees at the end.  
F3 has changed my life. I appreciate the ability to do stupid stuff with these guys, to receive their help, and to give help when and where I can.  
  
We had fun and got a great sweat.  It seemed that most of the PAX enjoyed it - although they were thrown off a bit when I arrived nearly late wearing a straw cowboy hat.  
  
A final Gracias to Bootlegger for taking us out in prayer.  
**_Vaya con Dios!_**
