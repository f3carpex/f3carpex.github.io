Rucking is, in my opinion, the best workout for fellowship without losing your breath. Oxygen is essential when working out, so when I do the normal boot camp workout I speak very little because I need my brain to concentrate on one thing ... breathing. As you are rucking at a decent pace (walking), you can talk and not gasp for air. This is my second reason for loving to ruck. #1 reason is my knees are not screaming at me.

This morning was a great day to ruck ... 50+ degrees and zero rain in the forecast. We all gathered around waiting to kick things off. Denali had GT. I had Rolling a Stone. Doogie had Bruisers.

YHC + 7 embarked on our rucking journey around Preston Village. We headed up the road and the mumblechatter was fierce ... WWW, are you taking us back to your house or Waffle House? We could have just got in our cars and drove. I replied, "That's no fun!"

Our first stop was to warm-up. GM, Sir Fazio forward/backwards, seal claps, overhead claps, then we finished with Jack Webbs x5 (thang 1).

Off to the next stop (thang 2), park benches. Partner up ... P1 does dips x25 in the bench while P2 does irkins on the bench back; flap jack when P1 completes dips.

Moving on to the next stop (thang 3). We dismount our ruck for some ground work. Low slow flutter x10 IC, into Hello Dolly x10 IC, into ruck presses x10 IC, into ruck flyes x10 IC ... repeato.

Time flies when you having fun. Mount the rucks back on and off we go to the flag. We made it back in the nick of time for COT.
