With all the BRR festivities, the Q sheet was looking a little empty a few days ago so YHC decided to grab the open spot at the original West Cary workout location, Thomas Brooks Park. In 2017 there were two Tuesday options. Only two. And the other site (FWD) is basically in south Raleigh so YHC and Crimson were FOD regulars.

Today was great weather, the humidity was manageable and a great group of PAX joined together for a wonderful start to the morning. There was good representation from my Cub Scout group, there was good representation from Apex, there was leadership present, AND we were blessed with BOTH Liverpool AND Nature Boy.

At 5:45 we did the pledge and then we were off to the upper parking lot for warm up.

Warm up:

- Mumble chatter filled SSHs
- Good mornings, with a proper intro from Nature Boy
- Windmills
- Cherry Pickers
- 10 Merkin OYO
- YHC had more planned but figured that was enough. No one was listening anyway!

Thing 1:

Mosey over to the other upper parking lot for some BLIMPS. Complete the exercise at each 'corner'.

- Burpees - 5
- Lunges - 10
- Imperial Walkers - 15
- Merkins - 20
- Plank Jacks - 25
- Squats - 30

Mosey to the lower parking lot opposite the flag.

Thing 2:

- Run the loop, stopping at the light pole for descending burpees (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)

Mosey to the flag.

Mary

- Out of time, so have a nice day!

COT

- Prayers for our bother dealing with a custody issue
- Blood drive - sign up on Slack!
- Welcome FNG Viewmaster!

NMS

- YHC did not forget out Mary or run out of time. We just skipped it due to the strong mumblechatter present. Everyone seemed to appreciate the extra Burpees!
- FOD is a great location, so many options of things to do there!
- Coffee at sweetwaters isn't starbucks, but its coffee shared with some awesome HIMs. Maybe one day they will leave their West Cary bubble and visit some other AOs!
