The Gloom Belongs to Us!  
10 Pax showed up to re-launch A-team.  YHC had the Q.  
Standard F3 disclaimer was recited, new disclaimers given to stay 6 feet apart and pax were instructed to be especially cautious of other any non-F3 people we may happen upon sharing our gloom.  
– The warm up: jog to the parking lot by the power lines, get in a big circle for some Good Mornings, Hill Billy’s, SSH, Merkins, Moutain Climbers, Sir Fazio Arm Circles and Circles Arm Fazio Sir.  
– We gained one PAX during the warmup, which makes 11. No problem, thanks to Chipper for stepping up to co-q.  To stay compliant with our governing authorities, count off 1s and 2s.  1s follow YHC, 2s follow Chipper.  
– Group 1 now with 6 pax, follow me to the rock pile!  
– The Thang: Get a rock, get in a big circle and lets do 30 curls, 30 tricep extenstions, 30 OH presses, 30 rock rows and 30 squats.  Take a break with 30 v-ups. Repeat this again with 30 reps each and a 50 LBC in cadence ‘break’ . Repeat it again with 20 reps each and another 50 LBC in cadence ‘break’.  Repeat it again with 15 reps each. This took a while.  
– Jog back to the flag, circling back to pick up the 6 thrice.  
– Get in a big spread out circle for some Mary till 5 seconds after Group 2 finishes.

– COT, 6 pax. Announcements: Yogi’s friend is doing 38 miles at Healing Transitions.  Tuesday night bible study – see Kwik Stop/slack for the zoom link.  
– Prayer requests: our nations leaders, YHC took us out.

NMS:  
– we had a nice view of Group 2 teasing us with some Monkey Humpers off in the distance.  
– The count in 1s and 2s and split into groups worked pretty well.  
– Great work by Chipper for stepping up to co-q at the last minute.  
– Thank you to WWW and Smokey for stepping up to site-q the re-launch of this glorious AO!  
– How about the gloom fellas!  Twas glorious! The weather was delightful taboot!

Throughout this time, many (including YHC) have been frustrated by some of the decisions of our governing authorities.  Some decisions seem illogical and intrusive to my freedom.  However, those governing authorities were established by God!  And, NONE of these government stay-at-home orders have asked me to sin or to stop worshiping or to stop reading the Word of God or to stop going to Bible studies or to stop praying or stop loving others or to stop serving others or to stop giving or to stop attempting to be obedient!

This passage has helped me several times over the past 6 to 8 weeks:

Romans 13:1-7 (NIV):

Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. 2 Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. 3 For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended. 4 For the one in authority is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God’s servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. 5 Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience.

6 This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God’s servants, who give their full time to governing. 7 Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.
