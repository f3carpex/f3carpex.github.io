![](images/img_0359.jpg)Feb 5th. 5/2. Fifth of February. So many reasons to celebrate......it's the 36th day of 2019 (Gregorian calendar), it's the start of the 4716th Chinese New Year (Year of pig) and it's also Red Ryder's M's birthday, who I believe was turning 21 (approximately).

With so much excitement to come, YHC started the customary countdown to the start of the beatdown at 3 minutes.....eventually the clock ticked down and we were ready to go....Starting the warm up with a "carpex legends mosey". **_TM R Pat Pending_**.
