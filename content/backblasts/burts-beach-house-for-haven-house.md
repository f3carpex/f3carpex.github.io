What's Up Men!

Over the last few years,  I have become increasingly more involved with Haven House Servicesa as has F3.   This year I am the chairperson for the Annual Campaign and our goal is to raise $130,000.    In 2019 we have an F3 CarPex Haven House team lead by Coney (John Healy) competing with other teams to raise the most money and to beat the F3 Raleigh team lead by McGrueber.   On our team along with Coney and me are Sabre, Rip Tide, Sosa, Flacco, Pierogi, Sky Blue/Franklin and Denali.

As you may know, Haven House Services is a local nonprofit that provides a lifeline to youth in need in our community. Tak a few minutes to watch this short video, I think you’ll see why I’m so passionate about helping them. [http://www.beintheircorner.org/team](http://www.beintheircorner.org/team)

This organization is awesome, and that is why I have agreed to lead Campaign and to participate on the Board and several committees.  Our  Raleigh, Cary/Apex F3 (Fitness, Fellowship and Faith) groups have chosen to support this organization in many ways inlcuding hosting an annual Christmas meal for families and children who utilize the resources of Haven House Services.

My personal goal this year is to raise $10,000 or more.

Will you join me in supporting Haven House and help me reach my goal....by participating in the Beach House for Haven House Raffle.  Here are the details.
