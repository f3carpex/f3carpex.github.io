It was a beautiful morning for work out that scored a 9/10 on the Cataract's Scale of Workouts. I am truly humbled by that score and will strive for the perfect score soon.

25 HIMs showed up for a fun time at the Peak of Good Living's best down town park.

When I start thinking about the workouts I want to put together, the stream of thoughts that sends me down these random paths of connections. Some how I end up always landing on Kevin Bacon. It is always surprising to me that Russel Crowe was the lead actor and feel like he has a similar acting repertoire as Nicholas Cage. I do believe that a movie needs to be made where they are both comic book heroes and a pair - Batman and Robin, Rocky and Bull Winkle or maybe a different path and we get a National Treasure 3. Kevin Bacon can be cast as well, we always end up there don't we.

Biner and YCH did a nice 3+ mile EC and I love this weather. According to the Strava, Biner set a new 5k PR. TCLAPS

**Thang 1** – Ascending Bear Crawls - This Sucked...in a good way

One Derkin on the curb, bear crawl across the parking lot, flip around and do 2 Derkins, bear crawl back...finished when you get to 13. It sucked, it was hard, and felt great! MC was non-existent, sign of a good start.

**Thang 2** – Deconstructed Burpies - These sucked, not sure they would have sucked as much if we did them first, but they sucked nonetheless (one of my favorite words in the english language. Three words, compounded = happiness in my weird brain)

Start with 10 Squats, 10 Leg Thrusts, 10 Merkins, 10 Leg Thrust, 10 Squat Jumps. Goal was to go down by 1 all the way to 1.

Called the audible, did I mention these sucked in a good way - did 8, 6, 4, 10 - makes perfect sense in my stream of consciousness kind of mind.

**Thang 3** \- Merkin Ladder - Easiest part of the Thangs

10 Merkins, run to the other end of the parking lot. 9 Merkins run back. Threw in a few Karokes and a few Billy Runs.

**Mary** \- Took the long way back to the flag, Old Maid led some dips and YHC picked up the Six.

Quick round of WWIIs and Dying Cockroaches and then Have a Nice Day
