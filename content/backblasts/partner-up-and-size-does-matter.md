- **When:** February 16th, 2018
- **QIC:** Earhart
- **The PAX:** Crimson, Red Ryder, Chappy, Wonderland, Hotspot, Snots, Imp, Highlighter, Water Wings, Parker, GTL, Term Paper, Pickles, BOGO, PBX, Biner, Blue-n-Out, Blueprint, Chum, Matlock, Chipper, Monkey Nut, Crabby (FNG), YHC Earhart

YHC comes in, five minutes to spare, with a great spring morning.  How can you not want to come out in the gloom when it is partly cloudy and 65 degrees?  Well, it appeared I was not the only one who felt that way because 23 fellow HIM posted as well.  I performed a personal disclaimer to our FNG, Jason and then to the broader audience as instructed earlier in the week by the COMZ.  After the pledge of allegiance, we take off for the upper area basketball courts, with some butt kickers, high knees, backwards runs, and a little bear crawling for good measure.  Finally, all 24 of us arrive at the basketball courts where we circle up (barely had the room) for:

## Warm Up

Good mornings

Side Straddle Hops (Only 20 in cadence)

Cotton Pickers

Imperial Walkers

## The Thang

Done with the warm-up, Q requests the PAX to pair-up with a similar size.  Lucky for me there was an even number of HIM so no odd-Pax out.  Once everyone is paired (I was fortunate to get Chappy!), Q yells out over the 23 HIM mumble chatter for 10 bropees, OYO.  Some did the proper form with their partner, some did just regular burpees. Where is the partnership here?

After the bropees, Q instructs partner one to the fence while partner 2 to the end-line for, the PAX guessed it, suicides and BTTW.  Flap-jack twice and then circle up again.

Next up is catch-me-if-you-can with partner 1 on a mosey while partner 2 is performing 5 starjumps.  We run all the way to the upper parking lot of the Nature Park and circle-up, performing some squat holds and pulse sets while waiting for the 6.  Once all the PAX arrive, we perform a quick round of partner derkins, 10 OYO each partner.

Done with the derkins, next up with your partner is bropee-ladders, performing ascending number of borpees per light post around the upper parking lot, finishing in front of the upper shelter with the final 8 bropees and plank hold while all PAX finish the ladder.

We then head as a group into the shelter for two more partner workouts.  The first are hail-mary’s, a dip performed on the back of your partner while they plank.  The other shelter workout is left-right step ups with high fives to your partner across the table in cadence.  One additional round and then we gather at the back of the shelter.

The partner workout up now is ascending partner merkins, running a loop between the shelter and the amphitheater.  We continue ascending our merkins up to 9, finishing at the shelter for more pull set squats while the PAX finish up.

Now it is time to get back to the flag and the lower parking lot and, how better to do that, than with more catch-me-if-you can.  Q added a lap around the pond for good measure (OK maybe a lap and half).  This time, Q calls for 5 goblet squats when you catch your partner finishing at the far bridge.  Once everyone is there, we do 10 more bropees, oyo just ‘cause.

On the bridge, we normally perform bear crawls but today is all about partners so, what better a workout than wheel barrel.  Perform the wheelbarrow half way, flap-jack and let your partner enjoy the experience.

Fellowship run back to the flag and circle up for a quick:

## Mary

Quick rounds of LBCs, Freddie mercs, and dying cockroaches.  Q tried for chill cut but was emphatically cut off by the PAX that we were done.

## COT
