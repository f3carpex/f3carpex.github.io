YHC made his virgin voyage to Whoville this morning. First time ever, and I have the Q. What could go wrong? First of all, I apparently park at the other end of the parking lot from where the flag is typically planted. Not that anyone would know, since the pin drop is in the middle of the school building.

Once we figure this out, and the clock strikes 0530, there is a disclaimer given and the pledge is pledged. Strava's on go.

## Warm Up

Mosey around back of the school to the bus loop area. Circle up for SSHs, Sir Fazio arm circles, Steve Earles, Runners stretch, calf stretch, and CF Merkins.

## Main Thang

Start with a lap around the bus loop, then complete 10 Mike Tysons, 10 LBCs, 10 Burpees. Do another lap, then count down 9-9-9. All the way down to 1.

## Transition Thang

Balls to the Wall Indian run

## Back to the Flag Thang

Mosey to the thru street that leads in front of the school. Stop at every 3rd street light for a different exercise. Eventually the PAX figured out this wasn't time to share our feelings (not yet), and we got the hang of it. We did a variety of exercises including Heels to Heaven, Burpees, Jump Squats, some thing One D called that we're never doing again, and something Clementine called that we might do again. Back to the flag and circle up.

## Mary

Captain Thor up to 10:40

## COT

A few Respects!, no Hates, 15 total in what must be Guilford County. We gave announcements, and prayers lifted up for Ratatouille's friend, One D's brother, BaB, Disco Duck's MIL, and YHC's mom. YHC took us out.

## NMS

- Alternative name for this backblast is "Heads Carolina, Tails California - the JoDee Messina Chronicles"
- I hope Bolton was somewhere warm
- We discussed the importance of grundle-dusting, as it relates to a good stretch
- Things went a little off the rails after that
- Lucky Charms doesn't talk much
- The rest of the PAX do, however
- Appreciate the opportunity to lead. Be a little better today than you were yesterday, then do it again tomorrow!
- MIAGD!!!
