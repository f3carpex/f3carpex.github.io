16 for the main event and 8 for the pre-run on what started out as a pretty normal Monday morning - 40ish degrees in December, a plan to cover some ground with a few exercises thrown in, and Burt yelling my hospital name before we even left the parking lot.

But we eventually got into the Regency neighborhood where someone released their pair of attack dogs as we were doing hill repeats in front of their driveway. The creatures looked a lot like the one pictured here (I know, scary, right?). Burt Slack-trolled the Carolina fans by calling them "Wofford Terriers", a reference to Wofford's upset over #17 UNC just a day ago.

Fortunately all 16 of us survived the workout and made it back to the start. Here's how it went down...

**Warm-Up**

- Jog to big parking lot and circle up
- 20 SSH, IC
- 15 IW, IC

- 20 Merkins

**Thang 1**

- Partner up for partner chase with 5 standard Merkins.
- Continue around the rest of the loop until back to Regency Pkwy
- Find a spot on the curb for 10 death squats, IC

**Thang 2**

- Jog across Regency Pkwy to the bottom of the hill for the next set of exercises
- Backwards run back up the hill. 5 HR merkins
- Run back to bottom of hill for 20 single count Freddy Mercs
- Regular run up other hill, avoiding the attack dogs, to the cross street for 5 jump squats
- Run back to bottom for 20 single could Freddy Mercs
- Repeato, adding 5 to the HR merkins and jump squats each time, and always doing 20 Freey Mercs when you pass the bottom

**Prayers/Praises**

- None spoken but we all have something on our hearts and minds. Let's remember the influence we can have on the people around us

Always an honor and a pleasure to lead the men of Carpex!
