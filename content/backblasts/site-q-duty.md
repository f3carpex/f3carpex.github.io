Maybe Hi-liter thinks it is at 5:45?  Maybe he is late? He has been here for a 5:30 start.  Humm, I guess we will stay close in case he is late.

Hi-liter leads a lot so when his alarm didn't go off and he was a no-show for FWD I was happy to step up and exercise my Site Q duty to lead the Q.

**Warm Up -** Run and circle up by the park back to the flag for for SSH, GM, Merkins, Hill Billies, PJ, MC

No Hi-liter so moving on.

**Cary Parkway Hill -** off to the hill for 5 merkins at each light pole.  Stretch and hold squat for the six.

**More Light Poles -** Jog to the office complex for alternating lunges, jog, bear crawl, and jog down to the bottom.

**Sevens -** over to the hill down to Tryon for sevens .  Spider Merkins at the bottom and CDDs at the top.

Run back to the flag for a set of **49ers** - 7 reps x 7 rounds of 3 exercises - squat jumps, american hammers, and diamond merkins.

Stretch and remind people the need to cool down with Man Hands passing out at Whiplash.

COT - 12 (3 for EC)

Thanks for letting me lead.
