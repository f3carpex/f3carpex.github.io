No, it's not the encyclopedia salesman nor roosters. It's being able to tell CW from CCW.

YHC showed up at #MeasureTwice a couple minutes early and just at 5:30 began the disclaimer (see NMS) and a talk-through of the run route. My goal had been to add a few short-cuts for the Clydesdales so we could run the same route and start/finish together with a few options in between. But Franklin started getting all antsy so instead of taking it nice and slow like I would have done normally with someone so clearly not in control of their faculties, I rushed through things. Oops.

## First Measure - Run:

Start towards the big oval in Carpenter Village. Clydesdales right, Greyhounds left. Callahan got confused and went left. He regretted/enjoyed it.

At the bottom of the oval and entering the path going CLOCKWISE around the lake, I expected to see the Clydesdales off in the distance, acting as the rabbit to Shut In's "Santa's Little Helper". But either those dudes got fast quick ... or they got lost.

They got lost. Or rather, they listened to Liverpool who apparently said, very authoritatively I imagine, that CLOCKWISE meant right.

It didn't.

Ah well. At least Callahan set a PR mile and 5K time!

## Second Measure - Stretch:

Stretchies. I watched a yoga-for-runners video by some Aussie lady the night before but clearly my explanation of some of the routines did not meet expectations. Will have to try again. I liked the shoulder stretches though.

## COT:

- 10
- Prayers: leaders, wisdom and patience. Pivot and Torpedo.
- Announcements: CSAUP is on.

## NMS:

- Coronavirus situation is not getting any better in NC. A reminder that we need to maintain social distancing at AOs
- Nice job Callahan!
- Parker rocks a solid headstand. YHC... a bit less so.
- I did log a geocache on the way home
- Great to see Betsy Ross out this morning. It's been a while but it's always great to see an old face out in the gloom.
