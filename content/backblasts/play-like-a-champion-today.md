With the previous day’s Burt-al beatdown and EC YHC was in no shape to run… Fragile status lately with a string of injuries.  Hell to grow old.  YHC was shocked to learn while Q shopping for the week that he had the Q at FOD the next day.  With the Burt-al Beatdown in mind YHC needed inspiration for a non running workout.  Pulling on a very dark day in Irish history YHC had just what he needed, the NCSU v ND hurricane debacle .  Just as the Irish would not run the ball, neither would we. Or, at a minimum limited run.
