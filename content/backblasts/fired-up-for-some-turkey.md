Wednesday morning's are always a high energy affair with Insomnia runners coming in and the Vesper and SNS crowd ready to kill it.  Add to that the pre-holiday excitement, temps near freezing and anticipation of Kitty's upcoming Thanksgiving extravaganza, New Year's Eve in Times Square had nothing on the 34 gathered at the Senior Center this morning!

At the crack of 5:45, the Vesper's headed out to explore new trails and the SNS crowd got after it.  Out of the parking lot, Smokey led the way, making a right before circling up at the corner for warm-ups of SSH's,  windmills (hi-speed type) , good mornings, merkins and a few calf stretches.  It was a loud affair, just trying to make it through to get the Pax running to calm the chatter.  I missed the conversations at the time but learned Parker has trouble speaking in the cold, I can tell you it is not a contagious condition.

Heading down the street, using light poles for alternating karaoke right, karaoke left, full sprint, mosey and do this twice, plank at end of street.  Plank it out for a bit, threw in a John Travolta followed by 10 Bobby Hurleys OYO. Bear crawl under the gate to the speed limit sign.  Recover and mosey to the shelter.

Shelter work was straight up vanilla, 20x's derkins, dips, irkins and L/R step ups, take a lap and repeato at 15 each.  Mosey in the direction of the lake, bear crawl under the next gate and continue to the back parking lot and circle up for some mid-workout Mary.  Apparently having Mary mid-workout rubs some Pax the wrong way but we powered through with American hammers, box cutters, boat canoe and LBC's.  Recover.

Mosey towards New Hampshire with a stop along the way for crabjacks (One of a few Q-bads on that one, jacks, not cakes).  Run the ridge and down the stairs, meet up at the bottom.  Half the group head back up stairs, 10 Carolina Dry Docks at the top, half the group stay and 10 Peter Parkers, flap jack.  Time allowed for only 3 trips up the stairs followed by a Mosey to Billy Run starting point, got us in at 6:31.

COT announcements were Thanksgiving convergence tomorrow at BO starting at 7:00 AM and of course many EC opportunities to be had, Operation Sweet Tooth toy collection, Christmas Party.  Prayer requests were not offered.  YHC took us out, message was lets try to be patient and present with the family during the holiday.  As always, but particularly reminded at this time of year, many thanks for all the Pax that continuously inspire me to be a better husband, father, friend and co-worker, it is a work in progress but the daily reminders in person and on social media do make a difference.  Peace out, going to get off the computer and be present in the family!
