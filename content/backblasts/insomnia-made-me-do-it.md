Once again I find myself not able to sleep. Awake at 1:10am, again at 2:32am and then finally at 4:44am. I give in. I get dressed and head out early to knock out an Insomnia pre SNS Q. 

During my 1.35m mozy, I take the time to reflect on all the things. 

I love that we have theses amazing parks/greenways to use. I appreciate the F3 brotherhood that I am a part of and the accountability it brings to my days and remember that no matter how bad I think I have it, someone else has it worse. The lack of “good sleep” is a minor in comparison to those who are truly suffering in some capacity. 

With that and at 5:45AM EST .. I see 20 of the finest Carpex has to offer. With no FNGS in sight, we star with The Pledge.  

Post pledge a few pealed off for a Vesper.  The rest of us made our way heading east on the road to the end of the street for warmups:
