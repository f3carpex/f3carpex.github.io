Strange times. I'd like to think that five years ago when I ventured to A-Team for my first post, I knew I'd be back ITG today to commemorate it. I surely couldn't have predicted anything else going on in the world this week.

Just one day prior, YHC had rucked the OTB TRM thanks to Old Maid Productions. Not feeling tip-top shape today but let's see what we can do. Good to meet some newer guys like Mama's Boy and Shipyard.

Brief disclaimer, plant/grow/serve, and off we go to the front lot.

Warm-up: SSH, merkin (Ma Bell was my first Q), MC, IW. We're going to summarize some of what I've learned about Virtuous Leadership.

Thang - Get Right:

- 5 burpees OYO. Run to speed bump.
- 10 merkins, 5 burpees OYO. Run to lower parking lot.
- 15 star jumps, 10 merkins, 5 burpees OYO. Run to end of pickle.
- 20 squats, 15 star jumps, 10 merkins, 5 burpees OYO. Run around pickle to shelter.
- 25 box jumps, et cetera.
- Fatigue makes cowards of us all. Hot Spot had run the Half-M yesterday and then went home and did 4 hours of home reno work. I was a worthless couch critter (my M: "You never lay on the couch." Thanks?) A man must be fit in order to lead.

Thang - Live Right:

- Run to bottom of Power Line Hill. It was this hill we partner carried during that first workout (Denali drew the heavy straw of YHC that day.) Pursuant to CDC guidelines, there would be no partner carries today. Still, partner up, from a distance.
- P1 run to top of hill, then to bottom, then back up to meet...
- P2 who is bear crawling up hill. Flapjack so P1 continues bear crawl, P2 runs.
- Living right, transferring positive habits, picking up the six, will help you stay Right.

Thang - Lead Right:

- Run to front parking lot.
- Shipyard, come to the center and call 10x SSH IC.
- PAX provide feedback and repeato until things are looking good.
- The LDP is an effective template: Schooling, Apprenticeship, Opportunity, Failure.

Thang - Leave Right:

- Now Shipyard mentors Mama's Boy on proper calling of an exercise.
- Mama's Boy leads us in 17x Merkins OMD. Good work, MB.
- Effective leaders make more leaders.

We ended the morning with 30x American Hammer IC and 60x flutter kicks IC. 60 months, 60 reps. Next year will be fun.

Thanks for the opportunity to lead. YHC took us out with prayers for patience and peace in the face of uncertainty, and guidance on how we can lead in our community.

TCeps to Burt for bringing the ruck and "liquid brick."
