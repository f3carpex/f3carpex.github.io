YHC is not known for Theme workouts, and to be fair, this is the only themed workout I've ever done, and could very possibly be the only. I'm just not very creative. I saw the Q spot open and grabbed it....LONG before realizing it was on May the 4th.....AKA Star Wars day. So, I had to come up with something. I even created a playlist, then left my BT speaker at home. Ah well.

Thanks Banjo for leading a nice EC run before, a good 5'ish miler. It was humid, and we got sweaty rather quickly.

35'ish showed up including four FNG's!!!!! Awesome work on the EH's!!!!! I gave a full, all-inclusive, elaborative briefing and then we were off! Welcome back to the workouts, Hermes!

**The WarmUp:**

- I advised that we were having a rather half-assed themed workout and then went into..... Also, Peter Mayhew, the actor who played Chewbacca recently passed away at the age of 74. He was 7'3"!!!!
- 20 SSH, to which the Pax responded had nothing to do with Star Wars. I did say half-assed, didn't I????
- 20 Imperial walkers - That's more like it!
- 10 Good mornings
- 20 Sebulba's (creature from Episode one who walked on his hands and used his feet for everything else.) aka Crabcakes

**The Thang:**

- Mosey down to the kiosk, then into the field to the bottom of the tallest part of the hill.
- I couldn't come up with anything for Episode 2, so we skipped it and went to the end of episode 3 where Anakin is in the lava and Obi Wan is about to leave him for dead, saying "It's Over, Anakin. I have the High Ground!". Shortly after, the Emperor saves Anakin and fixes him, finishing with "Rise, Lord Vader."
- Remembering Peter Mayhew, we did 7's on the hill to take the High Ground.
    - Burpees at the bottom
    - Turkish Getups at the top...to...Rise, like Lord Vader
    - We finished the set of 7's with an extra three, to commemorate Peter Mayhew's impressive 7'3" height.....I did say Half-assed, didn't I?
    
- Chronologically, the next movie is "Solo" and in it, the Falcon does the famous Kessel Run, so....
    - All you got to the pull-up bars! (This is a half mile or more.)
- Next up is Rogue One, and near the end the two heroes have to climb a tower of hard drives to retrieve the Death Star plans
    - Each pax does 50 pull ups and does OYO Mary and Merkins while resting between sets.
- We've now reach Episode 4, the original Star Wars movie. Let's see if we can find Alderan.....
    - Mosey to the dam in search of Alderan... At this point, Hello Kitty figured out the plan and ruined the surprise. As you may know, Alderan was destroyed by the Death Star and was just a bunch of rocks when Han and crew arrived.
    - Grab a healthy rock for a rock workout
    - 15 OH Presses, Rows, Curls, Tricep Extensions and Alt Merkins, then 10 of the same. Put the rocks back.
- The Empire Strikes Back begins on the ice planet Hoth and last year Jigglypuff did an awesome exercise modeled after the Hoth invasion.
    - Jog back to the field and partner up. Partner one is the AT-AT walker moving across the field, and partner two is the Snow Speeder - run out to the AT-AT, circle it then back to the start for 5 star jumps and repeat until the AT-AT reaches the berm. Flip flop for the return.
- On the Endor Moon in Return of the Jedi, the speeder chases are some of my favorite scenes. I had planned to do a catch me if you can through one of the wooded trails, but we were about out of time, so we just did it on the road back to the flag.
    - Catch me if you can, 5 Merkins, same partners
- At the flag, we did some Mary
    - Clone War II's (WWII's)
    - X-Wing / Tie Fighter (Boat / Canoe)
    - Mandalorian Hammers
    - and finally........Anakin to Padme's

Well that was fun, right? I warned you. And it's doubtful I'll do another themed workout. I like my workout theme to really just be an ass whooping, so I'll stick to that.

**COT**

**Announcements:**

- May 31st Century Day, All AO's open, bring a friend. Earhardt and Pivot are producing a "PUT6" list of PAx who haven't posted lately, let's get them re-engaged!

Hermes took us out in Prayer

Several enjoyed coffee at LaFarm, and YHC got a little rest before the GoRuck Light in DTR commemorating the Battle of Baghdad in April, 2003. Approximately 1/3 of the Pax were various F3 folks from all over and I'm confident we collectively EH'd at least 2-3 folks during the event!

My apologies to the Pax I missed...
