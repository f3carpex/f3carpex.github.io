The idea for this workout just fell into my lap. On Tuesday, there was some debate on Slack about what it takes to be a champion. Some would posit that showing up and staying makes you a champion. YHC would posit that deciding to get up at butt crack of dawn to attend a workout and sticking around is laudable, but is just a prerequisite to becoming a champion. Since YHC is the QIC, YHC gets to decide what constitutes a champion. Let's see.

The WarmUp

Run back toward the fields 5 and 6 parking lot and around the pickle before circling up for SSH, Copperhead Merkins, Crab Cakes, Crab Humpers, Crab Jacks, and a Hanging Good Morning. A bit different? Yeah. Warmed up tho? Yeah.

The Thang

Run to the Billy Run start line for the Ma Bell version of BLIMPS. Run to 1st light pole, do 5 burpees, run back to start and do 5 worst merkin ever burpees. Run to 2nd light pole, do 5 burpees + 10 lunges, run back to start and do 5 world's worst merkin ever burpees. Repeat pattern with 15 Imperial Walkers, 20 Merkins, 25 Plank Jacks, and 30 squats, adding a light pole distance for each one. Once done, meet at the cross walk for some Mary while the 6 finishes up. If you circled back to pick up the six before you finished the cycle, you are one step closer to becoming a champion.

Once all PAX are finished, run to the top of the Community Center parking lot and around the back. Pick a smallish rock for each hand and circle up for Jack Webbs (with the rocks). We made it to 7, then skipped to 10 for the final set, then had to run back to the flag where the Maynerds and Vesperers awaited.

COT

**Count-a-rama**: 44 (the GOAT of all numbers...cause the GOAT, David Thompson wore that number. Don't @ me)

**Name-a-rama**: 10 RESPECTS, 1 Freak of Nature, 33 mehs

**Announcements**: Frey Daddy awed us with his planned 24 hour, 100 mile run to benefit Healing Transitions. See deets for donating on Slack. His goal is $10,000. Pony up. Hi-Liter is also collecting funds and will be buying blankets and other supplies tomorrow for our brothers at HT. DM Hi-Liter and/or see deets on Slack.

**Prayers/Praises** - Swag, FiA member in Lexington, Red Ryder's single mother friend. Several unspoken

**QOTD**: YHC thought it appropriate to share the following quote by Henri Nouwen

Did I offer Peace today? Did I bring a smile to someone's face? Did I say words of healing? Did I let go of my anger and resentment? Did I forgive? Did I love? These are the real questions. I must trust that the little bit of love that I sow now will bear many fruits, here in this world and the life to come

**BOM**: YHC tooks us out in prayer

NMS

- If you have been under a rock and haven't heard Hello Kitty's Pick Up The Six podcast, do yourself a favor and go do it now. Today's episode features Frey Daddy and is a very good one, the best of course being the first episode!
- Frey Daddy is a beast. He just toyed with us today
- I love the sound of mumblechatter. If you mumbled today, you checked the box for the second question today, because it made me smile
- If you completed all of the above, pushed yourself, encouraged someone else to do the same, and you checked the box on all of the questions in Henri Nouwen's quote you, my friend, are a Champion in my book.
- It was an honor to lead you men. Thanks for all those who came, stayed, pushed, shared, encouraged, completed, and made someone else's life better today.
