Field of Dreams. The name just conjures up so many positive thoughts. YHC has spent a lot of time in this park, not related to F3. Many baseball and softball games have been played/coached/umpired out here. And it's a great site to move around and travel. So we're going to do a low mileage, core-heavy, sorta March Madness themed workout.

## Warm Up

Pledge of Allegiance, and disclaimer. Do a mosey lap around the parking lots. Circle up for SSHs, Sir Fazio arm circles, Seal claps, Steve Earles, Good mornings, Plank jacks, and calf stretches.

## Thang 1

Find a partner. Partner 1 works on completing 100 Mahktar N'Diayes and 200 Bobby Hurleys. Partner 2 runs to the shelter for 5 Michael Jordan (GOAT) rim-hanging pull-ups and runs back. Flip flop until complete.

## Thang 2

Run up the main drag, stopping at Q-determined intervals for 25 merkins, plus one round of Dying Cockroaches. Run back down to the parking lot, ensuring that PAX help Q complete his 100 Merkins for the day.

## Thang 3

Find your partner. Partner 1 does Freddie Mercs, while Partner 2 does his best Apple Turnover across the parking lot and moseys back, flip flop. 3 rounds of this.

When complete a mosey around the parking lot to make our mileage look reasonable. Stop by the hip hop boot camp setting up to show them how to do burpees - 10 OYO. Mosey back to the flag.

## Mary

PAX choice - some crowd favorites including American Hammers, Box Cutters, Boat/Canoe (in cadence?), and Scuba Buddhas. Finish up with CF Merkins.

## COT

Dang yall are old. A bunch of RESPECTS, one HONOR, no HATES, the rest Mehs. Including runners 29 total. Remember Piranha Park launch this Saturday at 0645. Prayer requests were taken, and YHC took us out.

## NMS

- Mark was having a hard time finding the hip hop boot camp. They were yelling for him, and he was walking in the wrong direction. We invited Mark to join us, but I think by then he realized where he needed to go. Probably the only dude there, and also probably the smartest guy out there.
- Bobby Hurleys don't count if you make the shot
- PAX caught on quick to the 100 merkin goal. They still did them.
- Strong MC and POGL presence - a lot of boxes were checked this morning. Rumor has it they had already graduated from Q school.
- Never done Boat Canoe in cadence before. Thanks Biner!
- Praises that Yahoo has made it home safely!
- Be better today than you were yesterday! MIAGD!!!
