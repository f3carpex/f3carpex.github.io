Shoulder stretch 10 second hold, each side

Calf stretch 10 count hold, each side

3 BRR guys stretched it out, and sounded like it was helpful.

Thang 1:

With the bell, 50 rows, 2 wolverines every 10 reps (10:2) mosey to the other end of the parking lot, 50 frog squats, 2 wolverines every 10 reps (10:2). 2 rounds.

Prayers/Praises: none mentioned that I recall.

Yahoo took us out (or was it Wahoo?)

NMS:

BRR FOMO is real, and the stories proved it.

Yahoo and Wahoo are 2 different people, I don't think I have ever seen both in the same place at the same time before.

Welcome to FNG N95! So much information to process for a name, but a really good dude!
