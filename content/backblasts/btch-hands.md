Nine PAX got to hear Disco Duck ask if he needed gloves, and subsequently named this backblast.

## Warm Up

Mosey to the top of the old parking deck. Run around a bit, even backwards. Circle up for SSHs, Sir Fazio arm circles, Steve Earles, Grundle stretch, calf stretch, hip stretch, and 25 merkins.

## The Thang

Mosey back down the stairs, and over to the center fountain the the middle of the municipal buildings. Set of 11s - Dying Cockroaches by the fountain, and pull-ups on the overhead walkway. We run a loop that goes up the stairs.

Once completed, meet by the fountain for sets of L/L and R/R step ups done the Pivot way, Dips and Dirkins.

Once this is completed, recover on the mosey back to the top of the old parking deck. Set of El Capitans, and more merkins. Then mosey back to the flag.

## Mary

PAX choice Mary exercises, and finish it off with 10 more Merkins.

## COT

9 PAX, with a couple Hates and over 50% Respects. Carpex Culture Month was announced prayer requests taken, and YHC took us out.

## NMS

- When DD asked if we needed gloves, YHC asked him the same back. And he said since he had b!tch hands, he might need them.
- Mojo did a great job calling WWIIs at the end. TClaps! Coming to a VQ near you.
- DD also called burpees during Mary, so that was predictable.
- Run Off was not late.
- Not exactly a repeat of Parker's Q at FMJ that morning, but not that different either.
- MIAGD!
