This Guy! (instead of YHC. What do you think Denali?) for an EC 3.5 mile run with now 53-year-old Michelob, Denali, Largemouth, Chanticleer, and Grandpa Banjo

Hey, look there's Hermes, Francois, and Hi-Liter. Let's work out.

Mosey to larger parking lot

**Warm-Up**  
Good Morning, Windmill, SSH, Calf Stretch

**Thang One**  
Located a nice size hill, ordered extra headwind and called out 11's with L/R Jump Lunges at the bottom and Squats at the top.

**Thang Two**  
Laps through the cemetery stopping from time to time for 15x IC LBCs, 10x IC Box Cutters, and 5x WWIs

**Mary**  
Boat Canoe, 100's, Have a Nice Day

**COT**  
No new announcements  
Prayers/Praises for Hi-Liter's work issue being resolved and everything we're dealing with.

PLEASE REMEMBER, to be kind and respect each other and each other's decisions. There will eventually be "the other side" of this, and we will all need to come together. Let's not have bad blood out there.

This Guy took us out with a quote from Seneca

> "Without an adversary, virtue shrivels. We see how great and how viable virtue is when by endurance, it shows what it is capable of.Â "
