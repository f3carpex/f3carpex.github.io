**Pre-BB**

One of my spiritual fathers often reminds me: "When life feels heavy, you're probably carrying something that God doesn't want you to carry. When you don't have grace for what you're carrying, it feels like the weight of the world is on your shoulders." I have walked through seasons of heaviness many, many times. Maybe you have too?

When I've prayed into the source of the heaviness, I've discovered: unforgiveness toward others, a lack of trust in God, misalignment between my call and my vocation, and more. Thankfully, I've also found the open arms of Jesus beckoning me to come and lay those burdens down.

Israel's greatest warrior and king, David, experienced that heaviness too. He wrote, "Cast your burden on the Lord, and he will sustain you; he will never permit the righteous to be moved.” (‭‭Psalms‬ ‭55:22‬ ‭ESV)‬‬

Today, at Phoenix, the "pet rock" we carried from one end of Bond Park to another reminded us to reflect on what may be making our lives feel unnecessarily heavy. May we all refuse to run through life carrying those things for which God has not given us grace.
