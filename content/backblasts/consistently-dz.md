There has been one constant in 2021 for YHC - DZ on Fridays with Saban. 3 for 3 so far! What better way to celebrate by hosting a classic DZ beatdown - no need to travel super far for this one.

Gather up, no FNG, and also no Flag, so no Pledge. Disclaimer, Mission, Follow Me!

Leave the park, take two lefts, and down Cary Parkway. Back into the park via the South entrance to the foot of bear crawl bridge. Warmup consisting of 8CGM/SSH/IW/SFAC/rSFAC/OC/HB. Follow me across the bridge.

Count off 1s and 2s just to split us up some. Everyone gets to do everything here! Two parts to this thang: A) run the big loop and stop at each set of cones to do escalating amounts of an exercise - starting with 2, then to 4, then 6, then 8, then 10 back at the start. B) Bear Crawl the bridge and mosey back, next time switch to Lunge Walk, and repeat.

1s start with A, 2s start with B. Alternate until we work through 5 rounds of Part A with Merkins, Squats, Frog Ups, Star Jumps, and Burpees.

The 2s skip the last round on the bridge to try to catch up, and gather up at the crossroads. Many a ten count by our 'S' PAX, and head back to up the shelter.

A random smattering of bench stuff while I try to catch my breath, and back to the flag \[area\]. An even more random smattering of Mary while I continue to attempt to catch my breath, feat. the Protractor and Nipplers called by Pierogi. Co-Q credit achieved. @Burt this one was ripe for the picking.

Have a nice day and THAT'S IT!

This was my only post this week... and it felt like it! Getting that January overwhelm a little earlier than usual. Burpee January + Carpex Challenge + Empty Q sheet = THERE IS SO MUCH AVAILABLE TO DO!!

How do you call it a classic DZ beatdown when you start by leaving the park. Bwerndt.

My only regret is that there was no Bach references. And also that I left the cones out on the course and had to backtrack to retrieve them.

Coffee was on point as always. TY4YL, Coney. MIAGW!
