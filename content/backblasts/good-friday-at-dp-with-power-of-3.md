A great morning for a special Good Friday workout at Dante’s!  After some early morning recon (the soccer fields are OPEN) and some EC with Disco Duck, we gather around the flag for a pledge and then a mosey up the hill to the right.  YHC mixed in butt kickers, high knees, backwards runs, and even some bear crawling.  We make it to the basketball court and circle up for:

## Warm Up

Side Straddle Hops

Good mornings

Imperial Walkers

Sir Fazio Arm Thingies

Overhead Claps

 

## The Thang

Done with our warm-up, Q divides the PAX into two groups, one group performing suicides on the court while the other group shows penance by performing BTTW.  Repeato for 3 times until we are sufficiently humbled.

Now we mosey around the fields and over to the far field where Q has placed during recon, 4 cones on the new field.  Much positive mumble chatter about the new field and how springy and soft it was over the old “grass” ones in the past.  The workout is as follows:

Sprint to first cone, perform 3 man-makers, karaoke left to the next cone and perform a merkin exercise, karaoke back to the middle for 3 more man-makers.  Karaoke or side shuffle to the right for squat exercises.  Back to the middle for yes, 3 more man-makers.  Backwards run to the far end for some core exercises, then back to the middle for yet again, 3 man-makers.  Back to the beginning and plank hold for the 6.  Reapeto 3 times with the following exercises at each station:

Merkins:  diamond, wide-arm, regular

Squats:  Jump, prisoner, regular

Core:  LBCs, flutter kicks, heels-to-heaven

Back at the start, for a Hotpot request we head over to the other field to perform what we call a Barry Sanders (black snake in the Exicon).  Basically we indian run the perimeter of the field moving between each PAX when you need to make it from the back to the front. We run the perimeter twice, giving each HIM ample opportunity to weave and bob.

Done with the Barry Sanders, we head back to the flag and circle up for PAX-led:

## Mary

We did, American Hammers, box-cutters, flutter kicks, cox-butters, merkins (twice), boat-canoe, dying cockroach, and more I can’t remember.

6:30 comes around and we are finally done.

 

## COT

**Count-a-rama:**  14 PAX

**Announcements:**

It was an honor to lead you men this morning.
