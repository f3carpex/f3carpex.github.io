As we come up on 241 years as a country, YHC felt it was appropriate to celebrate with a little victory lap. It's a beautiful lake with wonderful scenery and a typically well maintained Apex trail running around it. The backblasts suggested A-Team hadn't run a lap in quite some time (YHC found reference to one such effort in '16 led by a "McCants") so here we go.

#### Warm-up:

this was sort of done on the run

#### Thang:

Clock says 5:45 AM and with no FNG's in the house it is time to mosey. As we approach the first hill, some joker in a bright yellow outfit calls for bear crawls... Why not? Some high knees, butt-kickers, carioca and backwards run taboot.

Before we get to the lake, we warm up with quick GM, merkins.

At the lake, turn left. Along the way we merkined, burpeed, dipped and mary'ed while never letting the Six get too far in front.

A-Team is a hell of a place. Beautiful lake to give even Bond a run for its money. Enjoyed the work with you all this morning. Hopefully you saved some for Wednesday.

A lot more binds us together as a nation than tears us apart. Unfortunately it's the latter that gets all the news and social media attention. Look past that and embrace the things that draw us together. While politics does well to segment and separate us, we are stronger, better and more progressive as one country than we are as two, or three, or 300 million.

Happy Birthday Week USA
