YHC pulled up to your neighborhood Food Lion with windshield whippers a’whipping thinking, “this could suck.” But, alas the rain broke and a top-notch Monday was underway.

The #MeowMile was converted to the #DiscoDash as a pair of feathered felines headed towards the premiere AO in Apex on a Monday at 0545.

After a lovely stroll to the gate, YHC and the Duckman were met by 10 additional Lions, and with Ma-Bell amongst the PAX the promise of #MerkinMonday would hold true.

Sharply at 0545 (thanks Nan’tan) we were off for a mosey to the front lot.
