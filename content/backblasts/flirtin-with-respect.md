QIC Fluoride

The Pax: Ollie, Sosa, Dice, Oofta, Saban, Kyrie, Lite Brite, Chanticleer, Titanic, Mufasa, WKRP, Term Paper, Whorley, Joe Smith, Hermes, Wonder Bread.

It was a perfect morning at Marla Dorrell park as I rolled in for yet another beat down with my fellow pax. As I walked up I noticed Hermes seated in a lawn chair donning a straw hat and reading the paper. He said he was waiting to show me the add for Sprigmoor Retirement home, thought I might be interested. Not quite ready for that as I still have a 10 year old at home, I think the minimal age to get in is like 62???? we would have to see how he feels after my workout.

**Warmup**

SSH x 20

Good mornings x 20

Ran the back way to the Lower parking lot.

Burpees x 10 oyo

Mexicans x 20

Mtn Climbers x 20

 

**The Thang**

Four Corners at the four corners of the parking lot.

- 1 : Mericans x 10
- 2 : Box Cutters x 10
- 3: Burpees x 10
- 4: Monkee jumpers (facing the crossfitt gym ) x 10

Repeat this rotation 3 times.

Switch to:

- 1: Swiss mericans x 10
- 2: American hammers x 10
- 3: Plank-jack Burpees x 10
- 4: Jump Squats x 10

Repeat this rotation 3 times.

Money round:

One round with 10 mericans at station 1 increasing by 10 to 40 mericans at station 4 (In honor of Ma Bell the Patriarch ).

Heard a lot of groans when I announced this last set, realized when I got to station 1 I had misspoken and said Bupees, instead of Mericans. My bad but we stuck with the Mericans.

 

**Mary**

Run back to the parking lot and one more loop around the lot and circle to get our milage over 2 miles, so that CK would consider this an official workout.

- Box cutters x 20
- Six inch leg hold 5 count around the circle.
- Have a nice day with some interrupting chatter.

 

**COT**

Count off and name o rama.

Prayers for 2 children struggling with cancer.

Safe travel for Saban, and prayers for a recent graduate who is struggling with recently diagnosed MS.

QIC took us out in prayer.

 

**Naked Moleskin**

It was truly an honor to lead these men once again this morning. This week marks the beginning of my 4th year in F3. It has been 3 years of growth for me, being associated with this  organization. 7 years ago I had a major heart issue and spent a day and night at Rex. They placed a stent in my Widow-maker artery, which had been 100% blocked for several days. I was overweight, and a borderline diabetic at that time. I am only still here by the Grace of God. Thank all of you for helping get my body in the best shape its ever been in in the past three years.

Lets all remember one of the central themes to our organization: "Iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another." Prov. 27:17. We all can play a part in someones life today to help sharpen them physically, but also mentally and spiritually. Thank each of you that has helped sharpen me, and no I am not quite ready for Springmoor.

 

Again it was truly an honor to lead this morning,
