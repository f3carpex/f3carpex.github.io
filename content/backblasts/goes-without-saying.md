Today was YHCs 4th Q in 6 days. By now, the scoops of vanilla were overflowing the bowl so I had all intentions of coming up with a fool proof plan for today's beat down. Well, then I was on the road for 12 hours for work yesterday and decided to roll with a couple ideas I had in my head. It had been a while since I've posted at the OG Lions Den site and sort of forgot how intimate certain areas can be. That coupled with almost 20 Pax and I quickly realized my ideas weren't exactly going to go as planned and the Q started to get away from me slightly. So I decided to punt and go back to more vanilla. Everyone seemed pretty soaked by the end, which maybe was humidity, maybe was the level of difficulty, we may never know. One thing is for certain, everyone received their money's worth today! Anyway, here's what we did:

**Warmup:** 1 FNG courtesy of Water Wings, so disclaimers and mission statement were given. Pledge of allegiance recited and off we went. took the long way around the outside of all the parking lots to the best warmup location in Carpex at the entrance to the church for:  
SSH x 15 IC  
GM x 10 IC  
Imperial Walkers x 10 IC  
Sir Fazio Arm Circles fwd/rev x 10 IC each way  
Seal Claps x 10 IC  
Plank Jacks x 10 IC  
Calf Stretch L/R x 10 silent count each side (which goes without saying)

**Thang** **1:** Mosey to the bottom of the amphitheater/stairs. Each Pax will bear crawl up the stairs, but as they lift each leg will perform a Peter Parker. Squat hold for the 6 at he top. And this is where things started to unravel. YHC had a whole list of exercises he wanted to do at the top and bottom of the stairs, but there simply wasn't enough room for all 17 Pax. Parker suggested splitting up and 1/2 the Pax returning to the bottom for people's chair while the Pax at the top did 10 box jumps, so that's what we went with. We sort of performed 2 round of this and then YHC decided to switch things up.

**Thang 2:** Mosey to the back of the school and grab a rock from the pile, remembering where you picked it up from so you can replace it when finished. Then to the back parking lot for:  
Curls, shoulder presses, tricep extensions and rock rows all x 10 IC.  
Everyone mosey up the sidewalk to where it Ts and then back down to the lot.  
Repeato 2 more rounds of rocks with a mosey in between. Return your rocks (where you found them)

**Thang 3:** Pax get in groups of roughly 6 (more like 4) and Indigenous Peoples Run to the main entrance of the campus. Plank hold for the 6. Once everyone has arrived, 7s are called with 1 Merkin at the top and 6 Diamond Merkins at the bottom. Add 1 at the top and subtract at the bottom until the numbers are flipped. The 6 (YHC) is picked up.

**Mary:** Short mosey to the flag and on your 6. 
LBCs x 15 IC  
Hello Dolly x 10 IC  
E2K L/R x 10 IC each side  
Runners Stretch  
Pigeon Stretch  
Glute Stretch  
Have a nice day!

**COT:** 17 Pax. 1 FNG, Welcome Bump. He seemed to enjoy so sounds like he'll be back.  
Announcements- Sasquatch "virtual" CSAUP launching from The Green Mile Saturday at 0530. PLEASE hit the HC buttom on slack if planning on attending to ensure enough support for all. Also not a bad idea to plan to carry some extra hydration. Peirogi or Parker if anyone has questions/concerns.  
New AO hard launching Monday 7/20 at Apex Friendship High School, Wild Wild West. Standard bootcamp launching at 0530 weekly. YHC and Sir Chicken Little are your site Qs. Huge AO with tons of options. Lots of room on the Q sheet as well.  
Prayers/Praises- Prayers for Water Wings 2.x on upcoming tonsil surgery.  
Prayers for the family of a girl, Raychel, I went to high school with that passed away this week from an aneurysm. You just never know and every day is a gift.  
YHC took us out.

**NMS:** Admittedly this wasn't YHC's best ever Q, but I appreciate the opportunity to lead. I hope everyone enjoyed the workout and more so the fellowship. There were a number of Pax in attendance today that YHC hasn't seen in quite a wile. It's always nice to see some familiar faces. Mumblechatter was great today. And goes without saying was something Chicken Little said when I Qed Monday, which Hamm has been running with and now has Water WIngs on board as well. It's a long story, and this is already long enough, so I'll just leave it at that. MIAGD!
