YHC had the idea of doing a mini beast and 7s and so it just grew from there...

**Warmup**:  SSW (Signature Shut-In Warmup)

**Thang 1 - 6s:  Mini Beast** (6 laps of 3 exercises performed 6 times each) - 6 Merkins, 6 Pull Ups, 6 Monkey Humpers (run a lap) x 6

**Thang 2 - 7s:**  Sprints / Hand Release Merkins

**Thang 3 - 8s:  Shelter Work** - This was supposed to be 2 sets of 4 exercises (= 8s) but the group was so chatty I said, let's keep going! - Bench merkins  /  Bench Quick Feet  /  Dips  /  Heels to Heaven hanging off the edge of the table - 3 sets:  10 reps, 15 reps, 20 reps

**Thang 4 - Theme over...BLIMPS run (sort of 6s i guess...)** -  Run to the bridge while stopping for BLIMPS along the way.
