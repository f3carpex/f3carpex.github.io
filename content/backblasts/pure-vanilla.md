I didn't start out wanting to create a vanilla-flavored workout, but now that I look back over what we did, it reeks of the genus vanilla orchid.

A bunch of EC HIM did running, pull-ups and other stuff.

YHC took us out with 2 quotes from Swiss Psychiatrist Carl Jung

> "The least of things with a meaning is worth more in life than the greatest of things without it."

> _"Nothing has a stronger influence on their environment and their children than the un-lived life of the parent."_
