Day 4 of my Q week, and realizing that not all plans made in advance will always work out. I'm pretty sore, but somehow don't think I could get away with calling 45 minutes of "Have A Nice Day". And it's all about getting better, so we gotta give the Pax their money's worth.

Looking at my Winkie made last week, it really feels boring too. Last night, I see our boy Chewie taking a VQ at the new Tin2Iron, and being F3 we support our guys, we gotta do a fly by. So I get a quick plan in order, and I'm pretty set.

Get to Sovereign Grace Church for some ECP quite early, and this way I can drive in and check the routes I looked at last night on the Google.

Get to the park, see GTL and WONDERBREAD thinking they are going to Happy Dino it, but they go for an EC run and join back just before 530. YHC does a slow mile, Parker runs off for some run and ECP as well.

0530 hits, and 17 HIM stand around the flag. Mission statement, disclaimer, FNG check (none), and pledge and off we mosey.

Service road by the park for 20xSSH, 10x Micheal Phelps, runners and calf stretch.

Next parking lot is 10 Sumo Stomp Squats. mosey to the next lot and 10 Sumo Stomp Squats, 10 Merkins. Church parking lot for 10 SSS, 10 Merkins, and 10 WW2s. Go down, cross 55 to the small auto repair shop for 10 SSS, 10 Merkins, 10 WW2s, and 10 4 count mountain climbers. Mosey to Sovereign Grace, holler at those Pax, and 10 SSS, 10 Merkins, 10 WW2s, 10 mountain climbers, and 10 Hallelujahs (it is a church, after all). Mosey out of that parking lot, some more hollering back and forth, and up the hill by public works, past the cemetery. Start working back down. 10 SSS, 10 Merkins, 10 WW2s, and 10 mountain climbers. Mosey back to the Apex church parking lot for 10 SSS, 10 Merkins, 10 WW2s. Small repair shop in downtown, next to the small car lot, 10 SSS, 10 Merkins. Back to the flag, 10 SSS.

Mary: Pax called. told Ripper I'm not calling him, as I wasn't feeling the Boat/Canoe, so I called on Parker. Peter Parker Merkins (I should have just stayed with Ripper). Rooney called Dying Cockroaches. Came back to Ripper for the boat canoes. Silverfox with the Homer to Marge.

Announcements: 4 July business as normal, + the exploratory AO. Garfield, the 14 year old hate, Qing up BH next week. In his words "it's open to all men, so Riptide you get a pass". I think Compound W provided the burn cream.

Prayers/Praises: Freydaddy and family. Torpedo and family. Schroeder and family.

Parker was led to take us out.

NMS: Always a pleasure to be out in the Gloom with you gentlemen!

BH is a site that offers so much to do, so many places to go and see!

It's true what they say, running with faster guys will make you faster. Strava said I was in the low 9 minute mile range, but that could just be chasing Orphan, Garfield, and GTL.

Day 4 of planting sweat angels across CarPex.

I did not sugar cookie anyone today, but it was part of the original plan. Some may find it fun and funny, some may not and didn't want to push anyone to do something they don't want to. Though it woulda been fun, I think.

MIAGD gentlemen!
