Today is my birthday. I signed up over a month ago for this workout, not knowing what I'd be doing the preceding few days. This was a mistake. In hindsight, fartsacking would have been a great idea. However, I'm not one to back down off a commitment! I said I was going to do it, so I'm going to do it. I will note, however, that my body was in sever protest after yesterday's 12-Mile ruck, Murph Convergence, and full day of actively working outside in the heat. My watch indicated 40,000 steps Monday. Step one, get up and show up!

12 HIMs in the gloom for a relatively mild morning. Several have just finished an EC while others slept through. Guessing most pax were perhaps tired or sore from the Murph, I wanted to tap those muscles just a little, and then hit the core hard since the Murph doesn't target there.

Warm-Up:

- 20 SSH
- 20 Imperial Walkers
- 10 Good Mornings
- Runner Stretch
- Calf Stretch
- 10 Standard Merkins OMD

Thang 1:

- Jog to the bridge, partnering up on the mosey, stopping halfway for 20 Mary something or others, then on to the bridge.
- Partner wheelbarrow across the bridge stopping at the midpoint for 5 Worst Merkins Ever and switch.
    - Damn this is a long bridge!
- Jog down to the bottom, then luge walk back up. All the way up.
- OYO Stretching at the top until the 6 arrives
- Partner Wheelbarrow half way across, stopping at the 1/4 point for 5 pull ups and switch
- Lunch walk the second half of the bridge
- Mosey back, stopping half way for 20 more Mary something or others, American Hammers, IIRC

Thang 2: The Rock Pile

- Pick a big rock
- 20 Each Rows, Curls, Overhead Presses, Triceps Extensions with an agility trip through the "balls" between each
- 10 each Row, Curls and then a combined OHP + Triceps Extension for the last set with 20 Derkins and 20 Dips on the "balls" and a trip around the pickle in between
- Back to the flag for some Mary, ending with everyone's favorite: Boat / Canoe

YHC Took us out in Prayer.

As difficult as it was for me to force myself out of bed and into the gloom, I've got to admit, there's nowhere I'd rather be. Thanks all for the motivation, inspiration and brotherhood! 45 never felt so good!

(I think I'm missing one pax....Ollie maybe?)
