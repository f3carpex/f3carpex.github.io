QIC: WRENCH

Pull into SWW this morning, about 0525. Have never posted here, except for the 2019 Odessey, so a little unfamiliar with the turf of what's around. However, for a traveling Q, Google maps is super handy. Still sore from the rest of the week, try to stretch out some and see some HIMs I may not see normally.

0530 and 17 guys around the flag. Mission statement, disclaimer, and pledge.

20 x SSH

10 x GM

10 x Seal Claps.

And we mosey up to the Lochmere Pavilion, down to the back parking lot.

The Thang:

Walls of Jericho. 7 exercises, 7 reps, run a lap between each exercise. Sounds easy, but the 7 exercises are all burpee variations. Round 1, Standard Vanilla burpee. Round 2, Navy Seal Burpee. Round 3, Gorilla shuffle burpee. Round 4, contra Burpees (ascending merkin burpees). Round 5, wolverines. Round 6, bodybuilders/plank jack burpees. Round 7, double shot burpees (burpee and jump into SSH)

Mosey back to the flag for some Pax called mary. This spawns a trip down memory lane for Smokey, so some Homer to Marge and Monkey Humpers are a definite. LBCs, Dying Cockroaches, more burpees, Peter Parkers, Boat/Canoes, American Hammers, and a quick run of the pickle.

Announcements: 4 July AOs open, Apex Friendship.

Prayers/Praises: Safety for all. Between those traveling, staying close to home, and blowing stuff up. Some may not be safe, so be a leader in safety. F3 in general, HGTV said my dedication (which I appreciate!) but it's not me, it's the HIMs that come out to make each other better.

Globetrotter took us out.

NMS: day 5 of Qing, sweat angels all across CarPex this week.

I'm truly thankful to be a part of F3, it has been the best year of my life, surrounded by men of the highest impact, and have learned so much from you guys and have really noticed a difference in every aspect of my life. It was a chance encounter with Kitty a year ago that got me on this train, and has really opened my eyes to how a simple encounter with someone can really change the direction of someone, so minding that and how we are with others can really make a difference.

Thank you guys of SWW for my chance to lead this morning! MIAGD!
