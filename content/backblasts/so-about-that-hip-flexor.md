It's the day after Thanksgiving, November 29, 2019. After the triumphant T-day convergence, which sported a CARPEX record of 3,964 PAX including 561 FNGs, most of us practiced a LOT of gluttony. YHC consumed enough calories on turkey day to power a 747 jet on a cross-continental voyage. 11 HIDAs, including one FNG, were here to out-king their queens. Whether they knew it or not. Speaking of kings, Prom King is late so 10 burpees is our reward.

The F3 mission and disclaimer were given, then we pledged allegiance.

## Warm Up

Mosey to BC bridge, so of course we bear crawl that then continue mosey to the OTHER parking lot. Circle up for standard warm up including SSHs, Moroccan Night Clubs, Good Mornings, Steve Earles, Plank Jacks & CFMs.

## Thang 1

Partner up, head to the rock pile and choose wisely. Partner 1 does AMRAP Rock your body while Partner 2 runs the pickle, stopping to do 5 pullups on the way. Each partner does 3 rounds of each. Return rocks, everyone does 5 more pullups for good measure.

## Thang 2

Mosey to the back entrance to the park. 7s: World's worst merkins at one park entrance, Star jumps at the other entrance. In the middle at the bottom of the hill, do ascending burpos up to 6, then back down, each time you pass. Wrap it up as time is running out.

3 Respects, 2 hates, 6 Mehs. Welcome FNG Chicken Fried. YHC took us out

## NMS

- Chicken Fried actually dates Nature Boy's daughter AND still agreed to post with him. He nearly got named Motrin or Advil after pulling up lame during the 7s. I've never heard of a hip flexor. After we finished, he was heard saying "you guys don't mess around." He's right.
- I still think DP is one of the very BEST sites to Q. So much to do here. We only touched the surface.
- This was a tough workout - the F3 Greenbow guys set a high bar for hard workouts during the Ironpax challenge and we need to meet that challenge.
- The 7s sucked.
- Be a bit better today than you were yesterday. Then do it again tomorrow.
