One day of legally-styled backblasts is enough. If any member of the PAX enjoys that eloquent writing, I have a 45 page brief on why a RICO class action complaint needs to be dismissed that YHC would gladly pass along. For those of you who are normal, back to YHC’s normal BB style, which means one that can fit into a tweet:

16 PAX appeared at FMJ, including Peeping Tom from South Wake and his FNG cousin, n/k/a Speed Racer. The warmup was SSH. The Thang was the Murph. The soundtrack was Good Morning Vietnam. Khakis talked about licking palms. Announcements and prayers occurred. Day 2 of #mccantsweek is in the books.

YHC out.
