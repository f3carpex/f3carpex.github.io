17 men showed up on the least gloomiest of mornings in hopes that their Q shopping choice would pay off.  But let's be honest, when your choices are Largemouth or YHC, it's not pretty either way.

Warmup: Quick jog around the pickle to the wee-man's basketball court. Homer to Marge out the gate (Yoga Mat's gotta a date week with M), 51 SSHs (HBD CD), 10 penalty burpees (as YHC missed CDBDQ), hackey sacks (never again), GMs (just because), and FMs (YHC loves random Mary).

Thang: To the Hill (which needs a name, right?).  Round 1: run up said hill to sign for Hwy 64, 10 squats at each lightpole on the way down.  Round 2: 10 Merkins at each lightpole on the way up, 10 squats at each lightpole on the way down.  Round 3: run up said hill, 10 gorilla jumps at each lightpole on the way down.  AMRAP FMs, LBCs, and squats between rounds whilst the six returned.

Mary: 51 LBCs (HBD CD), 10 more penalty burpees.

Prayers go up to M Repeato M Repeato, to young Luke who faces stage 5 cancer, and to the men and women serving this great nation.  Thank you Your Honor for all your blessings.

PAX: YHC (McCants), Burt, CD, Yoga Mat, Smokey, Dice, Hello Kitty, Chanticleer, Mufasa, Oofta, Hermes, Shank, Term Paper, Ollie, Callahan, Down Under, Gilligan

NMS: I have the SNS Q tomorrow, I promise no hills.
