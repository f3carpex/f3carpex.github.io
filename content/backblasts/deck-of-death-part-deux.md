Stepping up in the gloom this morning is YHC for his Anniversary Q!  17 PAX showed up for some chilly fun.

**ECP:**

Theismann, Frisco, and Hotty Toddy showed up to prove ECP is actually easier in sub-freezing temperatures, while Chipper did a 3 mile EC run prior to the workout.

**War**

No FNGs (at this time), we head out for our limited run around the parking lot and down the hill and circle-up under the light for the:

**Warm Up**

Good mornings

Finish warmup, Q pulls out a deck of cards for a round of Deck of Death in celebration of the first workout he ever did in F3!!  The exercises were the following:

**Spades**:  Merkins, a down-count number based on the card

**Clubs**:  Plank Jacks, with reps based on the value of the card

**Diamonds**:  Squats, with reps based on the value of the card

**Hearts**:  LBCs, 4-count called by the Q

**Aces**:  run a lap around the pickle

**Jokers**–**Wild**:  Q call – Joker one: mosey up to the church and perform People’s Chair against the wall.  Second joker was mosey to the same wall and perform Balls to the Wall

Time is up and we still had 15 cards to go but, based on the groans and moans and the trail off on the mumble chatter, the PAX were sufficiently beatdown.

A quick round of American Hammers
