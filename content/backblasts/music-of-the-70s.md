In one of the top 5 darkest AOs in Carpex, 11 HIM strode into the gloom to the sultry sounds of Brown Sugar and Many Dirty Deeds were Done Dirt Cheap.

## Warm-up

After an enthusiastic rendition of the mission, disclaimer, and pledge, the PAX sauntered out of the parking lot, looped the pickle, and circled up for some Warm-ups.

- Side Straddle Hop
- Good Morning
- Imperial Walkers
- Sir Fazio Arm Circles
- Merkins
- Calf Stretch

## Thang One

Leaving the parking lot, we ran toward the pedestrian bridge and stopped at the crossing so the Q could catch up. There we did some relaxing LBCs and admired the beautiful night sky. Upward and onward to the Bridge where the PAX paired up for a fellowship DORA. The pair stayed together to do both the exercises and the running portion. The run was in two legs. The first was to cross the bridge and the second was to tackle the hill on the other side. At least 6 times across the bridge were required. The exercises were 100 Carolina Dry Docks, 200 Wright Brothers Back Lifts, and 300 Left-Right Lunges.

## Thang Two

With Thang One behind us, we ran again to the half-way point for a Circle of Merkins, 5 reps each. Then on to the rock pile at the Parking Lot. The PAX picked up lifting rocks for Rock Rows, Curls, Overhead Press, and Tricep Extensions with a little running weave through the concrete balls at the site. This completed our lovely time at Marla Dorrel Park so off we ran to the flag for COT.

## COT

We started COT with a Shawshank Redemption which was well deserved since we started our workout with a delightful Good Morning. The Odyssey was announced (see Slack for details), the Blue Ridge Relay was mentioned, and perhaps a third thing was discussed but not remembered by YHC. Prayers were requested for Frisco's Father-in-law at his father-in-law's passing and more that I do not remember but God does.

It was a privilege to lead you today and an honor to join in the gloom everyday.
