The time has come for the guard to change at Wolverine.  Bogo and Pivot completed their time at the helm.  They did and amazing job, continuing what Hi-Liter and Biner so graciously began two years ago.  The workout and transition went something like this.

Well, maybe it was a little more American.

Maybe not quite that patriotic and brave.  More like this.

Yes, the workout today was based on the GHHS Color Guard conditioning routines which are set to music.  Fortunately, Wolverine is one of the darkest of all the glooms.  I’m sure we looked pretty silly out there.

Anyway, this is what we did.

**Warm Up**: Mosey to the basketball court. Good Morning x10, SSH x20, Windmill x15, Imperial Walker x15.  The Q was a little off with the calls this morning.  That’s ok though.  The mumble chatter was there to keep him in line.
