Claymore is one of the tougher AOs I've had the pleasure of Q'ing. I'm slowly but surely trying to make my way around to all the AOs. I naturally gravitate towards running, and find it a nice reprieve between the reps of misery (merkins, burpIEs, etc.), but as Claymore is "limited run", I had to fill the time with reps on reps on reps. That's a lot of counting for this ol' boy.

5:38 - 3 Pax in the parking lot. Crap, I've scared them away again.  
5:40 - ...they start rolling in. Game on.

5:45 - No FNGs. Pledged Allegiance to our great country.

**Warm-ups:**  
Motivators (Sooey and I learned this gem while DR visiting F3 St. Louis)  
Good Mornings  
Hamstring stretch, left, center, right  
LBCs

**Thang: 1**  
Mosey to the small parkinglot and partner up with someone you dont like  
100 curb hop burpees total for the team (split however you want 50/50, 60/40, etc.)  
  
**Thang: 2**  
Mini 7's across the short side of the parking lot.  
\-Prisoner squats at one end, Mickey Mouse Merkins at the other end. Bear crawl each way. This IS limited run, right?! RIGHT! Are we having fun yet?! These sucked.

**Mini Thang: 3** (to fill the time as we finished the burpees faster than I thought we would! T-CEPS to the PAX for beasting it!)  
Mosey to the pic-i-nic tables for a round of da dips, left-right stepups, urkins.

**Back to the flag for Mary.**  
\-Freddy Mercury  
\-A few rounds of PAX-led Mary  
\-Asked Frisco for a 10-count (break) but he gave us a 10-count Mary instead. True #HIM!  
\-Absolution (8-count exercise which includes a Groiner, Makhtar N' Diayes, Chilly Jack). Per the holy Exicon, this is the solution to flabby abs and a reason to beg absolution for your sins.  
\-Modified Bear Crawl Circle of Fire - Pax circle up in plank position facing outwards. One by one, Pax bear crawls around the circle back to their starting position. Complete 1 merkin each time someone crawls past you.  
\-As Q was sufficiently smoked, last exercise is: Have a nice day

**Count-a-rama:** 10  
**Name-a-rama** (see above)
