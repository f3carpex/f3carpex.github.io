**AO:** A-TEAM

**PAX:** Frisco, Callahan, Crimson, Smokey, Cataracts, Sour Mash, Nature Boy, Disco Duck, Press On, Repeato, Sub, Sooey, Out Open, Hot Spot, Katniss, Badlands, Deuce, Chop Block, Hotty Toddy, Kenny, Two Factor, Lawn Dart, Ezekiel, Rachet, Bumble Bee and Imp

26 HIMS crushed a co-Q Billie Buster (Cataracts and Frisco) at A-Team as we welcomed back the Tiger @crimsom who predicted he would “Try” and keep up, but delivered an all-out effort and did more than try. Great to have you back Crim!

After respecting the flag and @frisco intros, we mosey’d Through the woods a bit based on my vast knowledge of Apex Community park (Thanks @repeato for picking up my phone) finally reaching the first parking lot. Truth be told I got lost. Our warm-up (Cataracts) included G-mornings, windmills and Squat holds to get the legs fired up. The PAX enjoyed the sweet sounds of the Native American Flutes. Here is where Smokey showed up to treat the PAX with some breakfast burpees. We kept a fast pace up to the parking lot at the top near the basketball courts to finish off our warm-ups including Merkins, Side Stradle, Drydocks with some penalty burpees In honor of  Out Open the “nicer” Kelly brother who appeared from the darkness. Thang 1 began and ended on the Basketball court for partner sprints , squats and balls to the wall for 3 rounds lead by the @frisco kid. The Music turned to ACDC, Van Halen and KISS... yeah!

@cataracts then lead the pax deeper into the park for some 7’s that included Billie Run with World’s worst Merkings on one side, Hell Squats after a jog back on the flip. The Pax lined up for an Indian Run heading back to the outer parking lot for from some Worlds Greatest stretch, some fun burpees and PAX full of Mary. Nature Boy finished us off by calling “Have a nice day”!

COT included prayers for Swag’s family and praises for Ausfahrts determination and spirit despite his circumstance. Frisco deliver a thoughtful prayer and A-Team was in the books for 1/7/19

I only mentioned the Bears because it fit the title and they lost ;) No bears were injured during the post.
