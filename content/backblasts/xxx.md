11-19-88. It's a number I've recorded a ton of times, and now it's 30 years in the past.

 

Warmup. This is Kryptonite, you get no warmup.

Follow me out to Ederlee and the lake greenway entrance. Pause for 30 merkins, OMD.

Partner up for a catch me if you can around the lake with 8 cadence prisoner squats (or just sprint if you're Flip Flop). Rendezvous at the fence.

10 penalty burpees followed by 30 LBCs, IC. Line up for a standard indian run aaaaaaand back around the lake.

 

30 merkins OMD at the original merkins spot, then get into groups of 4 or 5 for the 4or5-man indian run around the lake for the third time. Deja vu at the fence.

 

30 Sumo Squats, IC, and mosey to the bottom of the nearby hill.

 

50% to the top of the hill, mosey to the bottom.

X-Factors

75% to the top of the hill, mosey to the bottom.

XYs

AYG to the top of the hill, mosey to the bottom.

XOs

 

Mosey back to the flag. Plank hold call is largely ignored, so 5 penalty burpees. Lap around the pickle and then bring it home with 30 Freddy Mercs and a Have a Nice Day.

 

THAT'S IT.

Thirty! I was scared of this age for a while, but that's cooled down significantly in the last couple years. Having the two babies helps a lot, and coming to terms with things like going bald has helped as well. One thing that doesn't hurt for sure - y'all have me running nearly as fast as I ran when I was in high school. November 3rd was a personal record (high school included) on a 10k for me, and you PAX get the credit for that.

 

We had a Physical Chemistry professor in college who, upon reaching some of the more gritty sections decided to not hold back and give us the 'uncensored, triple-X treatment' of thermodynamics. He titled the associated emails with that section accordingly, and a chunk of the class didn't get them because the emails were filtered out. Hoping I can hit at least one of y'all's filters this morning with this backblast.

 

Jigglypuff Q distance record today - by more than a mile.

 

I was spooked about Q-ing a high tempo workout for the first time, but it wasn't tha... yeah this one was rough. Might be a while before I peek at GT. Glad to have this one under the belt nonetheless.

 

T-CLAPS TO CHAIRMAN MAO from Dallas! Give him a warm Carpex welcome this week!

 

Usually a pleasure, always an honor. Make it a great week!
