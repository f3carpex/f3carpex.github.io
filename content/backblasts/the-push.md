_Goal: To Push Everybody_

**Monday of Carpex Respect Week**  
I had never Q'd a running workout, so this was a test for me. All of my other Q's were at Tortoises or Hells Bells or Tin2Iron - all low to no running AOs.

Not known as a runner, this would be a challenge to me. So I put together a few pearls on a string to get more than a mile in.  
  
Many Respects showed up! Thanks for your support. Were you expecting an old man workout? Sorry...  
  
No FNGs, no disclaimer, and a forgotten reminder to "push yourself"

The younger PAX kept referring to old people stuff like Depends, Metimucle, and Werthers Original hard candy. I didn't know what they were talking about, so I mostly ignored them. But did you know that adult diapers are outselling baby diapers in the United States?  
  
I had another Thang planned just in case we had extra time. We didn't, but I heard that chicks dig a big weinke, so I had that covered.  
  
Run distance was about 1.7 miles. Maybe a bit low for A-Team, but not bad for a Respect Q.  
  
I could really feel that merkin circle and noticed that most of the PAX got near their limit in plank time. I consider this _**Goal accomplished**_.  
  
Thanks to Henny Penny for picking up the six.  
And Bootlegger for taking us out in prayer.
