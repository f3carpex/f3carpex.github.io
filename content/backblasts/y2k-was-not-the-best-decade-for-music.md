Rain threatened, but we did not care. 23 HIMs strode into the gloom to do battle with ourselves and be AWESOME!

There were no FNGs. The mission, disclaimer, and pledge were recited. We moseyed to the green way parking lot for warm-ups.

## Warm-ups

- Side Straddle Hops
- Good Mornings
- Cotton Pickers (my hammies were really tight)
- Sir Fazio Arm Circles
- Merkins
- Calf Stretches

## Thang One

We ran through the darkness of the green way heading for the bridge. We did 11's on the ramps on both sides of bridge with Superman Flutters on one side and LBCs on the other. We added 10 Burpees or Squat Jumps under the bridge just for fun. This took longer than expected so an audible was called.

## Mary

We ran back to parking lot and the flag for Mary. Who designs these long runs?

- American Hammers
- Freddie Mercuries
- Homer to Marge
- Merkins
- Have a Nice Day

## COT

We announced the Odyssey and some other things I now have forgotten. Although no specific prayers were requested, we lifted up all those we held silently in our hearts.

What a wonderful week. Thank you for your enthusiastic followership. The music at the beginning of the week was great. I am really unsure about my '90's and '00's playlist. I think it needs to be reworked. Until next year! SYITG.
