A bear there was  
A bear, a bear  
All black and brown  
And covered in hair

Two men, a goat  
And a dancing bear  
They danced and spun  
Up to the fair

They sweat and shuffled  
And pure and fair  
They hiked up their rucks  
All the way up in the air

From there to here  
From here to there  
On all fours  
And covered in hair

They swallowed a lot of pollen  
In that morning spring  
They popped their hips  
And up went the Rucks in a swing

From there to here  
From here to there  
For multiple round  
And covered in hair

Back to the circle  
To share joys and prayers  
WWW took us out  
And covered in no hair
