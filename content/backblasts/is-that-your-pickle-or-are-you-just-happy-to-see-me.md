Respect week. The GREATEST WEEK OF THE YEAR in carpex f3. The excitement was palpable at Salem Pond Park on Tuesday, November 17, 2020. Several did an EC run, there were 2 for EC Shred and 2 more for EC pull-ups. After Hermes finished reading the obituaries, we got all 24!!! guys to start out with the Pledge. There was a little mini-disclaimer beforehand, but it was likely not heard due to the intense MC centering around bad old people jokes.

## Warm Up

Mosey across the street to the big church parking lot. Circle up for SSHs, Moroccan Night Clubs, Steve Earles, Runners Stretch, Calf Stretch, CF Merkins. Lots of MC.

## Pickle 1

Mosey to the school parking lot opposite the softball field. Do a set of 11s - WW Merkins on one end, Star Jumps on the other.

## Pickle 2

Mosey to the back of the softball field. Run the loop around the field for a set of 7s - Burpees behind the outfield fence, and Bonnie Blairs by the concession stand.

That's all the time we'll have, otherwise there was a Pickle 3 plan. Mosey back to the flag, stopping at street lights on the left for squats and one round of Mike Tyson's.

## Mary

Ma Bell calls a set of Copperhead Merkins, YHC finishes off the PAX with a set of WWIIs. Have a Nice Day.

## COT

24 total, several Respects in the crowd, no Hates. Several announcements and prayer requests/praises were lifted, and Yahoo took us out.

## NMS

- Big crowd for FMJ - imagine if the Beige Bros had been there!
- Old jokes seemed to dissipate after the first set of WW Merkins (ode to BaB)
- Several guys traveled a bit to be there this morning - much appreciated
- Speaking of that, Funni Bonz reminded us that Carpex has a unique and special atmosphere. DO NOT take that for granted.
- I am honored to have led, and really appreciate all of you who hold me accountable
- MIAGD, and be just a little better today than you were yesterday. Do it again tomorrow!
