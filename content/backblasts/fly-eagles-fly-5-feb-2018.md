13 Hung(over)ry PAX showed up at Wolverine for holy-cow-that-was-an-amazing-Superbowl-so-GO-EAGLES beatdown. Temps were modest for January, no rain, and no last-minute additions.  Somebody had to help Hi-Liter with his strap-on (Breathtaker, that is).  Welcome and disclaimer to Tubeless’ Father-in-Law Dennis, and we’re off to the races.

Warm up: A moderate mosey pace down to Davis Drive Middle, with a little side-shuffle left and right along the way.  Circle up for 20 SSH IC, 15 mountain climber IC, 15 plank jacks IC, 15 merkins IC.  That’s it.  We’ve got work to do, so hopefully the PAX were warm.

Thang 1:

Head to the track and partner up.  This here’s something we call a one-mile Catch Me If You Can.  First lap, 10 merkins when you catch your partner.  Second lap, 10 LBC.  Third lap, 10 sumo squats.  Last lap, merkins again.  Gather near the entrance to the track and Water Wings led a plank hold while we waited for the six.  Didn’t have to wait long, all HIM working today.

Thang 2:

With your partner, alternate People’s Chair on the fence with other partner doing Merkins.  Knock out 200 Merkins as a pair.  Alternate as needed.  Once everyone had completed the Merkins, we moved on to 200 Freddy Merc’s alternated with People’s Chair.  This time the Freddy Mercs were led IC, 25 at a time, by YHC in one group and Ma Bell in the other.  Water Wings preferred sumo squats instead of People’s Chair so some PAX joined in.

Thang 3:

Time to get the heart rate up.  Toe the line at the 100 and give it AYG for 100 yards.  Drop for 10 merkins.  Couple 10 counts. Repeato x 2.  After the last 100, audible for 10 burpees OYO. Two lines of Indian Run back to the flag to finish just in time.

COT:  Welcome to FNG Troller!  Sign up for The Mule CSAUP, March 10.  Prayers for those continuing to heal, especially lifted up Hi-Liter’s dad today.
