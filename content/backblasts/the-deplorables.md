As a reverse psychology trick, YHC posted in the Slack "deploring" PAX who were skeered of work not to come to Flying Circus. 17 of the strongest PAX in NW Cary showed up. 17 of whom I apparently deplore. Of course I meant to "implore" the skeeredy cats not to come. But whatever.

0545 rolled around and what happened next went something like this:

**Warm-Up**

Jog around the gate and down the stairs to the high jump pad at the near end of the football field on what is the finest warmup area in all of NW Cary on a Thursday morning, followed by the worst circle up in the history of F3. I mean Jeezus people, you've been circling up since Kindergarten. Spread the F out!

- 25 x SSH IC
- 10 x Merkins IC
- 10 x Say Hey Willie's IC
- 5 x sloooooow Good Mornings IC

**The Thang**

Having already partnered up at the starting point, let's do a little Brodeo (Trademark to Beaker). With your partner, run a lap around the track then stairbarrow up the best set of steps in all of NW Cary on a Thursday morning stopping at each landing for 3 derkins. At the top, perform 3 Bropees with your partner. Run back down the steps and flapjack for another set of stairbarrows. Then repeato the whole cycle to include the lap around the track. When done, do American Hammers OYO until the six arrives.

Continuing the Brodeo theme, follow me over to the soccer pitch (I can't believe I just typed those words together). With your partner, run a lap around the full perimeter of the field then execute 15 Toddler Squats. Repeato...just because. When done, do American Hammers IC until the six arrives.

Continuing the Brodeo theme, follow me over to the elementary school external stairs, under which are the narrowest pull-up ledges in all of F3 Nation. Do 10 pull-ups and run a lap around the nearby path. Repeato...again, just because. When done, do American Hammers IC until the six arrives.

Follow me back to the middle school and over to the basketball court. Starting in the corner, do Traveling BTTWs to the opening in the fence then circle up for

**Mary**

Several PAX led us in a variety of Mary exercises in cadence, including Dying Cockroaches, LBCs, Freddie Mercuries, Box Cutters, and, of course, Merkins. And then the anti-exercise: Have a Nice Day

**COT**

**Count-a-rama**: 17 **Name-a-rama**: 1 hate, a buncha Mehs, and a few RESPECTs **Announcements**: a little about safety; Odyssey on 10/20 starting at St. Mary Magdalene's at 0600 **Prayers/Praise**s: good health; many unspoken **BOM**: YHC took us out in prayer

Thanks for showing up and letting me lead, fellas. I am forever strengthened by your example and presence. Ma Bell out.
