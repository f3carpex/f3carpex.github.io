6 PAX gather in the oppressive heat of July in North Carolina for an Earhart beatdown.  As reference, heat index for that time of day was 105.  Whew.  Mosey over to the old parking deck and up the stairs to the very top for:

## Warm Up

  
Control freak Good Afternoons

Windmills

Side Straddle Hops

Sir Fazio (done after going to the bottom deck)

## The Thang

Done with warm-ups, we mosey over to the field and behind the parking deck to retrieve the pain sticks.  We were careful to avoid any poison ivy or poisonous snakes.  Take the pain sticks back to the field, staying in the shade to help with the heat.  YHC and PAX perform a round of:

Curls for girls

Overhead Presses

Tricep Extensions

Rock rows

Run through the deck, again staying in the shade, and back to repeat the above two more times.

Next round of pain stick exercise included some squats, vertical presses, some modified bear crawl drags and any other pain inducing work with the great pain sticks.  Done with these, we put them away (again avoiding poison) and slow mosey to the large fountain.

At the large fountain, we needed a break, so Q called a suicide merkin, basically performing a merkin while sticking your head into the fountain.  10 count is enough to give us a break.  Next rounds are more standard, 15 reps of dips, dirkins, and step ups.  Finished with three rounds of these exercises we mosey over to the grass field for:

## Mary

LBCs

Flutter Kicks

E2Ks

WW2s

## Theresa’s (exicon term for stretching)

Quad stretches

Hamstring Stretch

Back stretch

Standing stretch

Bell tolls 18:45 and time to finish. (Literally, you can hear the Cary Bell toll)

## COT
