11 HIMs or maybe it's HIDAs came together in sub-freezing temps (24 degrees F). The beauty of the cold brisk morning was no ice. 0530 hrs struck and it was time to get these men warmed up after our pledge to Old Glory. Runners do two laps around the pickle and walkers do one meeting at the top of the parking lot circle for some warm-up. Once those muscles are warm, QIC explained the thangs.

Thang: 3 rounds of Jack Webbs, The look on everyone's face and the mumblechatter was EPIC, such as, are you sure you want to do that? The goal is to complete in time.

For those that do not know what Jack Webbs are, just think of the ratio 1:4. 1 rep of 1 exercise to 4 reps of another ending escalating and ending with 10:40 reps.

Round 1: Merkins to Alleluias

Runners run the pickle twice and walkers once to prepare for round 2.

Round 2: Jump squats to WWII. QIC audibled after 7:28 having the PAX do a mosey around the pickle and then continued. QIC audibled again at 8:32 switching WWII with LBCs. Those WWIIs got extremely tough at the higher numbers.

Runners run the pickle two laps and walkers one lap to prepare for round 3.

Round 3: Burpees and monkey humpers. QIC had to get some help with calling the cadence from the PAX because I was getting winded.

Runners run the pickle two laps and walkers one lap.

We all made it through. CHALLENGING!!!

NMS:

My Shield Lock was in attendance - thank you Cataracts, Disco Duck, Red Ryder and Sour Mash. It is an honor and I'm very blessed to have been in a SL with these HIMS over 3 years. These men keep me grounded.

I'm humbled to be out here with these men in sub-freezing temps. This speaks highly of these men on how important fitness and fellowship is to them.
