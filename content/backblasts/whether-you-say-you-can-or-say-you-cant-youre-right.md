**Pre-Blast**

13 HIM refused to sell themselves short at #ao-wed-tortoises. Today exemplified #ISI. Honored to work with y’all!

The men of this "limited run" AO just crushed the major components of a full Murph. Whether you say you can or say you can't, you're right.

**The Warmup**

- Pledge of Allegiance at the flag
- Run around the top lot, backwards run, Karaoke
- Circle up for: GM, WM, Calf Stretch, 1 Leg Merkins, SSH, Hillbillies

**The Thang**

- Partner up
- Dora 2,4,6: 200 pull-ups, 400 push-ups, 600 squats between you. While your partner performs reps, run to the far parking lot light and back. If you need less running, modify as necessary.
- Total mileage: ~1.5

**Mary**

- Side Plank Star Crunches, WWII sit-ups.
