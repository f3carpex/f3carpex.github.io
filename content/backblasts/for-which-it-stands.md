No shovel flag this morning, but there was a flag draped over a tree limb, so we pledged allegiance to it and then we were off.

**Warm-Up** Mosey almost all the way around the pickle and circle up for side straddle hops, imperial walkers, cotton pickers, Sir Fazios (all in perfect cadence) and then Nature Boy led us in the loudest Good Mornings ever.

**The Thang** Mosey out of the park, take a right and head over to the office park next door. 22's on the hill, hand release merkins at the top, squats at the bottom.

Mosey back to the shelter at the park for Aik'n Arms, Aik'n Abs, Aik'n Legs. Split into three groups, each group gets a card with three exercises, the first group to finish all the exercises calls recover and we rotate, everyone hits all three stations twice.

Aik'n Arms - 10 derkins, 20 dips, 30 irkins Aik'n Abs - 10 box cutters, 20 Homer-to-Marge, 30 dying cock-a-roaches Aik'n Legs - 10 box jumps, 20 step-ups, 30 squats

**Mary** Mosey back to the flag and circle up for pax led Mary.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  11 **Name-a-rama**:  5 RESPECT, 5 meh, 1 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Praises for Cataracts going full time with his new company and making an offer on a new house, prayers for Crimson and his family, prayers for Ausfhart, McCants, Sooey and all of our other brothers recovering from injuries. **BOM**:  Liverpool took us out

**NMS** There was no shovel flag, but there was a flag draped over a tree limb, and a hoe for some reason. Credit to Shut-in for coming up with the backblast title.

I love calling 22's, they're just like 11's except the math is harder, I don't think anyone counted correctly on these (including YHC) but almost everyone complained about them.

Aik'n Arms, Aik'n Abs, Aik'n Legs was borrowed from our brothers at Groundpounders in South Wake.

When I arrived at the park Liverpool said "Hey Disco!" and didn't stop talking until COT was done. He brought his A+ mumble chatter game.

If you were there you'd know what PSP means, if you weren't there you'll have to ask Puck.

Nice to have Flip Flop back in the gloom, it's obvious this AO would fall apart without him.

Proud to lead this group of HIMs.
