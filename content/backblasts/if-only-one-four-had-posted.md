Dammit. So nearly perfect. Some days the all the elements align perfectly and the symmetry and perfection of the universe reveals itself. This was nearly one of those days, if only ONE-FOUR had shown up!

Today, the day widely known as Valentine's Day, is notable for three very good reasons.

Firstly, sure, there is saint valentine. Martyred for marrying young lovers against the wishes of the Roman emperor, and sentenced to death through beating, torture and then eventually decapitation.

Secondly, and bearing some striking similarities to valentines story (especially the beating and torture bits) is the anniversary of the now legendary Nature Boys VQ, at the world renowned field of dreams (the finest AO in NW Cary on a TUESDAY morning).

Finally and very meaningfully to the men gathered in the gloom on this chilly February morning - it was also to be the day before one of our brothers went into hospital "to get some work down". Today should perhaps be known as Sooey's Surgery Send off. Only he didn't show.

Speaking of no shows, back to where I started off and ONE-FOURs terrible decision not to post this morning at the finest AO in NW Cary on a THURSDAY morning.

An entire forty five minute work out focused on 14 repetitions of every exercise to recognize the significance of today, was followed by a count-a-rama that disappointingly stopped at 13. IF ONLY ONE-FOUR had turned up to add that one extra HIM and get the count to 14 which almost poetically could have ended with ONE-FOUR, then what a perfectly balanced way it would have been to start the day.

Thanks one-four. No, really, thanks.
