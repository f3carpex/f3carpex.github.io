So it's been a little while since YHC last Qed. Before BRR actually. Apparently I was still in BRR training mode when I devised the plan for today. That, coupled with how sore YHC is from back to back days of Iron Pax and low mileage for this point in the week I guess. Sorry to those that decided to follow me out there today, but hopefully you felt as though you received a proper beat down. Here's what we did:

**Warmup**: Frisco (yeah, THAT Frisco!) needed to borrow a block for week 4 Iron Pax challenge so I got caught up talking to him and Trike before realizing it was already 0546. I owe some of you a minute. You can just deduct it from your tab for today's workout. Anyway, we say the pledge and 4 head off to do Iron Pax so 4 of us head off for the workout. Mosey to the bottom of the road and square up for:  
SSH x 15 IC  
Good Mornings x 5 IC  
Sir Fazio Arm Circles x 10 IC  
Seal Claps x 10 IC  
Imperial Walkers x 10 IC  
Plank Jacks x 10 IC  
Calf Stretch L/R x 10 silent count each side

**The Thang:** We head up the hill on a mosey and I declare the warmup area is considered "bottom A." Up to the light which is "the top" and down Green Level Church Rd to the fire hydrant/guard rail area which shall be known as "bottom B." Double 7s or 42s is the plan.  
36 LBCs at Bottom B  
6 Steve Earles at the Top  
36 leg raises at Bottom A  
Run back and forth decreasing the exercises at the bottoms by 6 and increasing at the top by 6. This proved to be a bit ambitious as we only made it through like 3 full rounds before it was time to head back to the flag.

**Mary:** Square up again for a mix of Mary exercises and stretches.  
E2K L/R x 10 IC with a L/R glute stretch in between.  
Supermans x 10 IC  
Runner's Stretch L/R  
Pigeon Stretch L/R  
Peter Parkers x 10 IC  
Butterfly Stretch  
Freddy Mercuries x 10 IC  
Hello Dolly x 10 IC  
Homer to Marge x 10 IC  
Have a Nice Day

**Cot:** The iron paxers weren't back yet, so we went ahead and did count-o-rama and name-o-rama with just our 4.
