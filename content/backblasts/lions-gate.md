**Moleskin:**

\-We ran about three miles. Largemouth was disappointed but everyone else went away satisfied. -The street names and subdivision names around Regency Park are epic. Avenues of the Estate, Lions Gate, Venetian Court, Michelangelo Way...you can't make that stuff up. Who that those names were a good idea? -PetSounds thought we weren't going to run when I did the practice 3s by 5 in the parking lot. Wrong brother. We run at Kryptonite. -Shut-In wears two shirts. One for warmth and one for his areloas...ask him about them. Ha. -FreeBird stole Michelob's car. Okay, I'm making things up now but not about the last comment.
