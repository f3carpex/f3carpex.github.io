0530 with one PAX who will remain nameless skating in just in time. YHC reminded everyone this is a weighted workout so be careful with form, and don't hurt yourself. Started with a parking lot mosey followed by the pledge of allegiance.

Prayers/Praises: Prayer for Yahoo's co-worker fighting cancer. Reiterating prayers from Slack. Praise for Joker's new M.

YHC took us out. Yahoo kindly brought coffee again. Fact: Yahoo's coffee is good, but not as good as his Hokie Gobble.
