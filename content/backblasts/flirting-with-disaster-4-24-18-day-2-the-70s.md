The week of Smokey continues with the music of the 1970's.  Joining us on this rainy workout were Aerosmith, Kansas, Stevie Wonder, Ram Jam, and many more.  The songs inspired both singing (well, you could call it singing) and chanting from the PAX.  It was an experience though only 8 of us braved the weather to enjoy it.

We started with a brief run to the front circle for warm ups.

Warm Ups

Side Straddle Hop

The Q was chilled by the rain so off we run for the shelter of the parking area at Parkway Professional Park.

Thing 1

We partnered up for Dora 1-2-3.5 with one doing the exercise and the other running the parking area.

Thank you to Oofta and Term Paper for staying with The Six toward the end of the workout.  They said it was for the music, but I know it is because they care.  Tomorrow is the halfway point.  Join me at Shakin' not Stirred to find out what the Centipede is!
