Coming from a quick meeting with my Shield Lock had me rolling in hot at 0528. Hi-Liter gives me the 2:07 warning. A healthy crowd awaited eager to sweat out the weekend of indulgence in the name of honoring the mothers in our lives. Props to all the HIMs out there who lifted up their Ms this weekend. That Most important relationship in our lives is often the one who imparts to our 2.0s the virtues of love, patience and kindness. Good job men! Disclaimer, Pledge of Allegiance, Follow me!

Regardless of what season of the year it is it always seems really dark at Wolverine. The pax offer directions for a wandering Q as we make our way to the nearby church parking lot for the warm-up.

Warm-up: Steve Earle, Nancy Kerrigan, Cotton Picker, 1-5-1 Burpo Ladder, Good Morning. Mosey on back to the play ground for Thang 1.

Thang 1: Dora 1-2-3: 100 Pull-ups, 200 Dirkins, 300 Sumo Squats with a hop. Partner 2 runs the pickle. Dang, that zonked many of us but I could tell some of the pax were just getting warmed up. Mosey to the basketball court for Thang 2.

Thang 2: Sea to Forest: Crab Walk from end-line to half court - 10 Burpos - Bear Crawl to the other end-line, run back to the start. Rinse and repeat for 8-6-4-2-0 burpos. Ok, now we're breathing hard but we still have 7 minutes. Mosey back toward the church for a new/old exercise.

Thang 3. After a few J-Los while the 6 comes in we met Sleeping Hillbilly. The exact same thing as a side plank star crunch. One more set of J-Los because they are my new favorite. Mosey back to the flag for a quick Mary.
