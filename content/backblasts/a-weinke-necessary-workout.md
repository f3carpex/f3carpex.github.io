Well my streak of finishing on-time this week ends with 1. However I appreciated the fact that this group of HIM never once mentioned the time or seemed to care we were a few minutes over. I guess they were just having too much "fun."

I thought about starting this BB with all the things Franklin, Banjo and Hi-Liter had issues with during my Q, and all the helpful suggestions and comments they shared. But then I decided to keep it positive instead. But I appreciated your help gentlemen and look forward to getting better and making those changes at my next Q.

**Warm Up**

Knowing what was coming I kept the WU short and sweet: Good Mornings, Windmill, Sprinkler

**Thang 1**

Starting at one end of the track we completed an exercise, then ran to the other end of the track, completed the afore mentioned exercise and added a new one. And so on and so on and so on. Each time increasing our reps by 5. When all was said and done, we ran 1.5 miles and did a whole lot of reps.

Burpees x5 Merkins x10 LBC x15 Carolina Dry Docks x20 Squats x25 American Hammer x30 Hallelujah x35 SSH x40 Overhead Clap x45 Mountain Climber x50 Table Dips x55 Plank Hold x60 seconds

It doesn't look like much on paper, but I highly encourage you to give it a try. Plus it needs a name, so after you complete it, please feel free to reply with suggestions.

**COT**

Memorial Day Convergence 5/28, Miniature Golf thing & Cornhole thing (Check with Franklin. He seemed to know the details)

Prayers for Napster as he prepares to move in 2 weeks

YHC concluded with a quote from Ghandi

> "Keep your thoughts positive because your thoughts become your words. Keep your words positive because your words become your behavior. Keep your behavior positive because your behavior becomes your habits. Keep your habits positive because your habits become your values. Keep your values positive because your values become your destiny."
