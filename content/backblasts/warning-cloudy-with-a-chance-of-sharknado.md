In the great tradition of the original Bounty Hunters site Q Water Wings, YHC wanted to continue the benchmark day fitness challenge.  In an effort to save a little gas in the tank for the main event, we relocated the historical fitness test location of Baucom Elementary School over to Apex Town Hall courtyard across the street from the skate park.

 

It was October of 2016 at Field of Dreams when YHC (and Carpex, I think...) was first introduced to the Sharknado.  DonHo from Charlotte was guest Q and he brought the pain that day, pushing me the closest to spilling merlot I had ever come at F3.  It truly is a great measuring stick when done a few times a year, and YHC decided to make the time limit 25 minutes.  Here is what happened:

 

Mosey from the flag to the Apex Town Hall courtyard

 

**Warm up**

15 Side shuttle hops

15 Imperial Walkers

7 Good mornings

20 standard merkins

15 Mountain Climbers

 

**The Thang**

The Sharknado - 25 minutes on the clock, GO

- 15 Burpees (followed by a lap around the diamond) \*diamond is approx 740 feet, .14 miles
    
- 20 Diamond Merkins (followed by a lap around the diamond)
    
- 20 WWII Sit-Ups (followed by a lap around the diamond)
    
- 20 Merkins (followed by a lap around the diamond)
    
- 20 Scorpion Dry Docks (followed by a lap around the diamond)
    

REPEATO as many times as you can
