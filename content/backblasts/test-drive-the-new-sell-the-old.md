- 15 pax loosely gathered, sprinkled throughout the parking lot. Most had never been to this site, include one of the site Q’s who shall remain nameless. Ok, it’s me. I have been a total slacker as a site Q. I learned it by co-site Qing with the king of slacker Site Qs…who will remain nameless. Ok, it was Callahan. But you already knew that.

Everyone converged in the middle of the parking lot after the flag was finally planted. No FNGs and we are off on our test drive.

Warm-up: Run a lap then 20SSH, 10GM, 10 PJs, 10 IW, 20 mt climbers, 20 merkins.

Thang part 1 – Esau’s ladder, 2 hand release merkins (signature move), run the hill, add 2 HRMs, run the hill, continue to 16 HRMs. Now jog to the Preston traffic circle, stopping on the way for 10 squat jumps IC.

Thang Part 2- Run the Circle, stopping at each light pole for 1 burpee. Lap 2, 2 star jumps at each pole. Lap 3, 3 CDDs. Lap 4, 4 squat jumps. In between there were Biner-Hops (TM).

Thang Part 3 – Run to a parking lot for 10 death squats, 10 PJs, 10 Mt Climbers, 10 merkins, repeato with NO recover.

Thang Part 4 – fellowship jog back to the carpool loop, halfway stop for 10 squat jumps. At the loop, 1 lap 90%, 2 laps 70%, final lap 100%.

Back to the flag for 30 LBCs IC.

15 pax and they all had names.

Thanks for allowing me to lead and test drive the new ride.

NMS

– Flip flop was there even though he is a site Q at DZ. He said his co-site Q would cover so he could get away for a week….must be nice.

– Biner knows exercises, and will now hesitate to correct you or anyone on form. He was not smiling so he must have been serious.

– I hope Biner and Franklin don’t post together often……feelings could be hurt.

– I forgot to lift up Chanticleers old car during COT. He is selling it today, God willing, if it makes it to the exchange site without breaking down. Sad day for sure.

– I may or may not be salty about past co-site Q experiences. Like a brokenhearted teenager, I may have trust issues for a while but look forward to my new 3-way site Q arrangement.
