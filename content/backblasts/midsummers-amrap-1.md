After what looked to be a great evening of 2nd F on a Midsummer's eve many of the PAX were operating on High Octane fuel. A fuel they would call upon about halfway through the morning as there were digging deep on an AMRAP + 1.

0520 ECP - YHC, WWW, GTL, Red Rider, Frisco continued our quest to get bigger, stronger and faster at the pull-up one repetition at a time.

0545- A good looking crowd had amassed many still wearing last nights fun deep in their eyes.

Once again, we Pledged our Allegiance.

Mosey over to the soccer field and circle up for warm up

Warm up

- Steve Earl (cadence is just hard to call on some exercises)

Mini -Thang

Indian run over to the Amphitheater. YHC has always seen this area as a great place to get some work in. And work we did.

Thang 1

- DORA 1-2-3: 100 Derkins, 200 Shoulder taps from the derkin position, 300 fluttering Supermans
- Partner 1 bear crawls up around one level of the amphitheater then returns to relieve partner 2

That was fun. While some of the PAX may have been questioning that last beverage they too were showing up strong on this DORA.

After a 10 count we mosey. To where? They were too close to not use them.

Thang 2

- AMRAP + 1 pull-ups (strong showing with many crushing over 10 reps in this set)
- AMRAP + 1 pull-ups (Oooo, really, that's fine we got one more in us.)
- AMRAP + 1 pull-ups (SERIOUSLY!, I'm tired. But I will do this for my brothers)

One lap mosey around the pond to take in the sights and sounds of the morning then... head back to the soccer field where it all began (Bear crawl the bridge of course)
