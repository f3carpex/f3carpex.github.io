**Pre-Blast**

- 10 HIM for the first of 19 Murphs (in 2019) at BH.

**The Warmup**

- Pledge of Allegiance at the...the site Q didn't bring out the flag so it wouldn't get wet?! 10 penalty burpees.

- Run like 10 yards, circle up for...Smokey and Joe Smith request the shelter for warmups...so we dropped for Superman Holds and WWII sit-ups. We also did a few GMs.

****T**he T**hang****

- Do a Murph (run to Baucom Elem., run two laps to complete the mile)
- Run back to the...still no flag. So we'll do more Superman's and WWIIs.
- Stretch.

**COT**
