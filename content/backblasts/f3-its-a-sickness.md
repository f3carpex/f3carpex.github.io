2 Years of F3.  It's a sickness that I just can't seem to kick.  One that has resulted in lack of sleep, frequent muscle aches, and lack of cell phone battery. I just can't stop setting my alarm in anticipation of that brotherhood, the laughs, and personal growth. 2 years of F3 is something to be celebrated.  What better way to celebrate than pain.
