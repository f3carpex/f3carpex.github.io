Day 2 of my Q week was a success with the PAX of WCary, giving a good showing given the current situation. Having focused on arms and shoulders the previous day, YHC wanted to give the PAX a well-balanced workout, so today’s beatdown focused elsewhere. However, due to that focus, YHC had some struggle with cadence counting the exercises today (T-Claps to Franklin for sorting it out).

Warm Up:

Mosey to top of the hill lot. GMs, Windmills and Burpees were done.

ME:

Today’s beatdown was very simple, yet had a lot of grumbling. Basic premise was the Bruce Lee workout.

First set was 20 of the following:

American Hammer-Cadence

Heels to Heaven-Cadence

100s

Frog Crunches- IC

Then we moseyed down the hill for the next set of 30 of the below:

American Hammer-Cadence

Heels to Heaven-Cadence

100s

Frog Crunches- IC

LBCs-Cadence

Next, the PAX were instructed to pick a disease free traveling rock, and form a single file line for a social distancing Indian run to the far lot.

Next the PAX did 40 of the below:

Rock over head WW2s.

American Hammer-Cadence

Heels to Heaven-Cadence

100s

Frog Crunches- IC

LBCs-Cadence

PAX reformed the line, and Indian ran back to the flag, finished with a 5 Merkin Ring of Fire.

COT:

Continued prayers for Clementine’s M, and by extension his sanity with the 2.0’s. Praise for F3 and the role it takes in our lives, forming us into better man for occasions like this.

Reminder to be aware of who you are around, and mindful of your effect on them. Encourage PAX who do not feel comfortable posting during this. Channel #1stF-Virtual for info on posting from a distance.
