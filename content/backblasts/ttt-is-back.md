It was a perfect morning to bring out the old tank-top, but it required digging it out of my pile of old t-shirts that I keep for some reason. Is it possible for t-shirts to have sentimental value? Smokey had the same idea, and looked quite stylish in his colorful apparel.

We began with the F3 disclaimer and pledge. Then a short jog to the end of the park for:

**Warm-up:**

- SSH, Hill Billys, Good Morning, Fazio Arm Circles

**Thang 1: This seemed like a good idea at the time...**

- 4x4 Ladder - run between light posts, increasing 4x4s by two each time, for 4 sets
- Turns out this was harder than YHC thought, as I intended to do 5 sets

**Thang 2: Jog over to Town Hall for...**

- Bear Crawl 1-2-3s: 100 merkins, 200 LBCs, 300 squats

**Thang 3: Someone left bags of top soil lying around, so we used them for...**

- curls for girls
- overhead press
- rows

**Mary: PAX Choice**

- Freddy Mercury
- Box Cutters
- American Hammers
- Peter Parkers (regular and chill-cut)
- Merkins (sadly, more merkins)
- WWII
- Protractor
- ... and more I forgot ...

**CoT**
