In jest only, as McCants was called to remain on the home front, but YHC did set out to dedicate a portion of the beatdown to the one and only, PJ "McCants" Puryear.

On what is the calendar date of YHC's 1-year F3 Carpex Anniversary, I had to grab the Q spot at Carpex's premier AO in downtown Cary on a Thursday morning.

22 are here, 20 for the beat-down and 2 with sacks of rice on their shoulders. With tanks tops on all but 1 (The Pelt protested and went full long sleeves)... let's go!

**Warmup:**

- In honor of McCants who Q'd my first workout at BO, YHC ran fast to the warm up circle while the Pax followed in standard mosey pace
- SSHx20
- Loom arrives a few minutes late sans tank top.
- Back to the flag to get our bro a tank.
- Run back to the bank.
- SSH x20
- Sir Walter Fazio Arm Circles (front and back)
- Over head clap
- Seal clap
- Run to the side street behind the train tracks for 4 sets of bear crawls and American Hammers, LBC, Bonnies Torture in between

**The Thang:**

- Head to pocket park for a round of Planks (L arm up), Merkins, Planks (R arm up), Diamond Merkins (L arm up), Wide grip merkins
- Partner up to run the pickle and complete 100 Aussie Pull Ups, 200 Erkins, 300 Squats
- Pack to pocket park for LBCs, Dying Cockroah and Boat Canoes
- 2 rounds of L/R step ups and dips so that Callie and Ripper could get a jump start on their rice ruck back to the lot
- WAIT IS THAT CAPTAIN KIRK???? He beemed in, in a Lyft... incredible.
- A quick stop back on the street for a round of bear crawls and box cutters

Pax run together back to the flag and finish up with a billy run to the flag from the end of the street as the clock strikes 06:30:00

**Announcements and Prayers:**

- Get with Bert (Burt, Birt, Byrt) on Cornhole details.
- Prayers for Nancy's journey to heavan, for our Ms, and for Napster's upcoming move

**NMS:**

- Captain Kirk, fellas. Enough said.
- Mini Me gave YHC the best compliment ever, "you're the only Q I've ever heard mumble chat himself." Thank you brother. It means more that you know.
- Love you guys -- been a helluva year -- attack the day with an enthusiasm unknown to man.
