25 HIM showed up at A-Team on the chilliest Monday morning in months to help Hotspot and YHC celebrate our 5-year F3-versary. Back in our day, A-Team was one of only 3 workouts per week in the Cary/Apex area, and there was no Carpex region as we were still part of F3 Raleigh. We're very thankful to have been a part of the F3 growth in our area and also for the fellowship of all the Carpex PAX.

Special appearance this morning by F3 Raleigh's Cold Stone who EHed us for weeks then pulled the classic move of not showing up at our FNG workout. If you think about some of the pre-Carpex OGs from back then, you can imagine what kind of morning that was for Hotspot and myself. Cold Stone is my boss outside the gloom so I shouldn't bad mouth him too much, and he did show up the next week, so it's all good.
