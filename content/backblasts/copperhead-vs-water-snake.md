Fresh off my triumph return from the South Wake Fritter Challenge, and conquering their Kettlebell workout, Crazy Ivan, I decided to "borrow" some of the workout and bring it with me to Hell's Bells.

YHC & Chanticleer (Yes, you read that right) for a little 3 mile EC with bathroom break.

Kettlebells were chosen, a circle was formed, and the workout began.

On our run from the amphitheater to the pull up bars is when we noticed the snake. A hearty discussion on the type of snake then took place. However I kept thinking that just moments ago, in the dark, we were doing Merkins not far from where our friend was just spotted. Yikes!

YHC took us out with a quote from Winston Churchill
