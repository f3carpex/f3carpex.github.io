Got word that the Lowther (aka Chanticleer) Household was experiencing some sicknesses so I was ready to answer the call. Thursday 7 PM it was official, I would be running the show at GT. You know, I am the 3rd-wheel site Q there. And it has been a long time since I have Q'd, so it was meant to be.

13 gathered, 2 had on backpacks, one drove a 15 passenger van, and all where hoping to see Chanticleer. I did try to channel my inner Chanti, when he texted me about covering, I was a few minutes from reading **Proverbs 1:7** "Fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, fools despise wisdom and instruction." So there was our theme. Chanticleer did Romans 10:9 at FWD one time.
