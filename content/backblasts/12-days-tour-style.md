It was fun to lead 12 Days. I have to admit that I was looking for a fairly straightforward plan for this Q, but hopefully the travel factor made it a little more interesting. It was great to keep the group together and the small numbers today made it easy. I know that Chanticleer was dying to move ahead and lap the Pax, but that wasn’t in the cards for today.

FNG Rudy is one of the kids staying with Water Wings and he was a beast. Great young man.

Refinery was en fuego with Flacco providing his normal strong leadership, and he paid for all of us!

Always an honor and a pleasure.
