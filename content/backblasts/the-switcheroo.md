Not going to pretend that I wasn’t a little excited about this day. Today was my 1 year anniversary of my first post with F3, right here at Dante’s Peak. A couple weeks prior Parker messaged me about this week as it was his 40th birthday last year for my first post. So we decided to keep it quiet, leave him on the Q Sheet, and pull the switcheroo on the Pax that I would be leading the beat down for the morning. Thanks for the handoff Parker. I tried my best to replicate Parker’s Q from last year and somehow make it suck even more. Quite the task. Here we go!

No fng’s so recite the pledge and mosey to the end of the lot to warmup. SSH’s, good mornings, runners stretch, and sir fazio both ways. Sufficiently warmed up, on to the thang.

Mosey to the soccer field and line up along the field. Inside of a hat were 12 cards. Each Pax drew a card, all performed the exercise, followed by gasser to other side of field, plank hold until all Pax crossed the line, gasser back to starting point. Pull another card and repeat. Cards drawn included; 40 count balls to the wall, 20 merkins, 20 Carolina dry docks, 20 burpees,40 count people’s chair,20 jump lunges,20 yards of bear crawls, 20 jump squats, 20 count each of plank/chill cut/right arm up/left arm up, 20 yard of partner wheel barrows, 20 monkey humpers, & Pax choice (20 burpees were called!). Then mosey over the playground for whatever you can find to do. Pull-ups were done, merkins, plank holds. Circle up around the flag and made it through 15 Pax of 10 count of their favorite Mary.  

Praises- Happy Birthday to Parker tomorrow and thank you for allowing me to Q this morning.
