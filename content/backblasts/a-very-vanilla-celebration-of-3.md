Yep, it's been 3 years of F3 for YHC. I decided to keep this low key, not Q every day of the week, but do a single anniversary Q at the site where I started. My 3 year F3 journey has been epic - I've grown in ways I couldn't imagine. Not just physically but emotionally and in how I relate to and lead others. F3 truly is leadership training thinly disguised as a men's workout group.

## Warm Up

Mosey around to the other side of the parking lot. Circle up for SSHs, Sir Fazio Arm Circles, Steve Earles, a few stretches, a few Merkins, and a single Good Morning led by Crimson.

## Thang 1

Partner up for a Dora. Partner 1 completes 100 Merkins, 200 Squats, and 300 LBCs while Partner 2 runs to the pull up bars and completes 5. Rotate until exercises are complete.

## Thang 2

Mosey to the hill across the street for 7s. Burpees at the top, and burpees at the bottom. Regular run to the bottom and backwards run to the top.

## Thang 2.1

Back by the flag, bear crawl half the length of the parking lot, then crawl bear back.

## Mary

American Hammers, Dying Cockroaches, and WWII situps, then Have a Nice Day

## COT

9 HIMs, with several respects in the mix. YHC gave his F3 testimony, we lifted up Ratattouille's friend Mary battling cancer and Bubba's son Dylan as he seeks treatment. YHC took us out.

## NMS

I want to personally thank Disco Duck for being there on the first day I ever posted, and being there today. DD was the guy who was always checking on me when I first started. YHC has some knee issues and they really could have made me quit F3 before I ever really got started. On 2 separate occasions in the first 3 months, I had to take a few weeks off to let myself heal. Today, I'm down about 23 pounds and in the best shape I've been in in many many years. I have tons of new friends and it seems like I make more every week. And while I'm still a work in progress, and need to get better every day, I'm light years ahead of where I was. Keep looking for that next sad clown who doesn't really know what he's missing. I didn't.
