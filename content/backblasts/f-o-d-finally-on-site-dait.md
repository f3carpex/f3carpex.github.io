Despite Bartman setting the bar pretty low for Site Qs ([here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rOBxkzl91TqPfqQVnUoDXp4Jy3o6D7wocBSiB87wIYQ/edit)), I still think I manage to limbo it more than hurdle it. Having missed the past two weeks at FOD due to illness and fartsackiness, I was on the hook for the Q today. Since, as the site Q, I was my own back-up, I kinda sorta had to show. I think there is a lesson here...

**Beaker's Beginnings (The Warm-Up)**  
Mosey South to the dimmest trail not at Wolverine and down to the road. Circle up for Side-Straddle Hops, Good Mornings, and Windmills. Mosey down the road back to the rock pile with high knees, butt-kickers, and side shuffles along the way. Circle up for Sir Fazio Arm Circles and Michael Phelps.

**Beaker's Beatdown (The Thang)**  
The FOD PAX are notoriously bad at listening to instructions. Now it may be just an over-exuberance to start exercises (_cough_\-Franklin-_cough_), but since YHC tends to have elaborate activities, it is a terrible combination. My solution: force 'em all into a nice tight circle and plank-hold while I explain - it helps to focus the mind.  
Part I - Partner up with a rock. Partner 1 runs up the hill, with the rock. Partner 2 does 10 Merkins, 10 Dying Cockroaches, and 10 Squats, then gives chase. Flapjack and repeat all the way up and down the hill.  
Part II - Plank-hold while I explain. Partner 1 lunge-walks around the pickle, rock held overhead. Partner 2 does 5 reps of each exercise above and chases. Flapjack and repeat all the way around the pickle  
Part III - Noah's Beastly Ark: 6 exercises, performed 6x each, at 6 stations. Time prevented us from completing the whole set, so we ended up at 466, which sounds like a muscle car instead of the sign of the beast. Oh well, we got:  
Gorilla Walks between stations with 6x monkey-humpers at each  
Bunny hops between stations with 6x squats at each  
Crab walks between stations with 6x Low-country Crabs at each  
Duck walks between stations with 6x Little-man Jumping Jacks at each

**Beaker's Beatitudes (The COT)**  
16 for the ME and 5 for the Non-Vesper  
Announcements - relatively quiet on the Western Front, except YHC announced the availability of Q slots throughout Carpex.  
Prayers - Liverpool, Ms of various PAX

**Beaker's BS (The NMS)**  
Not much here, not that there wasn't plenty of entertaining mumblechatter. More that it is now 5 days and 1 Q later, and I do not remember it all. Except ma Bell's "Duck walk" sounds. He really went all out in the authenticity department. I am glad I was on the other end of the court.
