This was a tough day for sure. I'll keep it limited an amplify the few things that are truly relevant:

- I'm thankful for Burt and his perpetual support of the PAX. Seeing that flag and the beer made my day.

- I'm thankful for Riptide. He was up early to let me know and not leave me hanging there.

- Great to see Foie Gras back after a devastating week. Here for you, man.

- Please read [Frisco's post](https://f3carpex.com/2021/08/19/raleigh-guys-cant-count/). Doesn't necessarily need amplification today... but for the PAX of the future looking back at our illustrious backblast history here at BO, read it.

Here's what we did:

Pledge / Follow me to the bank. / One loop around the building and gather in warmup circle for GM/SM/HB/SFAC/OC/rSFAC/SC.

Follow me to the Rush Hour flags for IW/MC/Squats. Follow me to the parking deck and grab a pain stick.

The Thang - Starting from the bottom, bring your pain stick up one full level. Leave the painstick and run the loops back to the bottom and run back up the stairs to the pain stick. Repeato until the painstick reaches the top. At the top, a few painstick exercises together and back down the stairs. Return the painstick.

Mosey back to the flag, stopping a few times for squats. At the flag, more squats, and have a nice day.

Callahan stepped into the role of the BO gifts-presenter just fine. He'll make a great site Q one day.
