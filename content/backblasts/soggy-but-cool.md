**AO:** Wolverine  
**Workout Date:** 06/14/21  
YHC had some ideas for today, but when site Q Build-a-Bear reached out about a prerun and/or AO overview, I took him up on the offer. I was on the fence about doing the Number of the Beast again. I didn't want to repeat myself if any Phoenix PAX showed, and I had considered bringing back Rack Em Stack Em. Should we stay in the park, or head over to Davis Drive Middle? I would definitely ask BAB what he thought.

**Warm Up:**  
State the mission, check for FNGs (0), and give the disclaimer  
Pledge of Allegiance  
Mosey around the big field and circle up for warmups:  
Side Straddle Hop x20 In Cadence (IC)  
Good Morning x5 IC  
Imperial Walker x20 IC  
Sir Fazio Arm Circles forward x10 IC, reverse x10 IC  
I've scaled back my warmups recently, but after the prerun I felt like we should at least do Downward Dog. So we did.  
Based on positive mumble chatter from Callahan, I threw in World's Greatest Stretch as well.

**Main Event**  
**1)** Mosey around the field in a (roughly) square route and drop cones at the "corners" to prep for **Rack Em (Un)Stack Em**. I mixed the exercises up after reading somebody's prior backblast. First corner: 5 Burpees. Second Corner: 10 Merkins. Third Corner: 15 Squats. Fourth Corner: four-count American Hammers.  
**2)** Mosey to the hill for **Jacob’s Ladder** (Star Jumps). Time seems to be passing slowly. I realized later I got confused about ending at 0630 instead of the scheduled 0615. 
**3)** **Jack Webbs** in the field. First time JWs for Hot Pants, maybe others. We took ten count breaks at the end of sets 7 (Callahan), 8 (Loom), and 9 (Build-A-Bear). Build-A-Bear was not as generous with the count as his predecessors.  
**4)** Mosey around the field again and adjust the cones for Dora. Build-A-Bear reminded me of the true stop time, so we cut Dora in half. Partner up for **half Dora** (50 Merkins, 100 LBCs, 150 Squats).

**Mary:**  
After taking an informal poll, Mary would be back at start, not in the middle of the soggy field. On the mosey, Loom suggested stretching which I thought was a good idea.  
Dolly x10 IC  
Rosalita x10 IC  
Homer to Marge x10 IC  
Freddie Mercury x10 IC  
Captain Thor up to five (Five WW1, 20 single count American Hammer)  
Downward Dog and isolated calves  
Pigeon Pose Stretch (right and left)

**COT:**  
7 PAX  
  
Announcements:  
Sawgrass Sunday  
Convergence 7/3 at Phoenix at 0700 for 1776 workout  
F3 Raleigh Day of Service 6/19 starting at Vatican City 0700  
  
Prayers unspoken.  
YHC took us out. BOM for those comfortable with it.

**Naked Moleskin:**  
My first time using props! After struggling to find obvious landmarks for Number of the Beast stations at Flirtin' With Disaster, I remembered I had some old cones in my garage. This weekend I finally remembered to find them and throw them in my trunk. Rack Em Stack Em went smoothly, and I think the visual of the cones helped out with that. Maybe not, but I'll keep them in my trunk for the future.  
T-claps to Build-A-Bear for the prerun leadership and the site info. Also for confirmation of the difference between a four-count versus In Cadence.  
Callahan says I'm 15% Carpex now, so I've got that going for me.  
Great fitness and fellowship, gentlemen. Honored to lead.  
This was my sixty-first #F3Q21 #2021Challenge Q (sixty-third overall). Next Q is tomorrow (Tuesday) at Nutcracker in South Wake.
