I couldn't think of a title so I just kept what was already there.

A few of us got after it a bit early for a little EC, and I saw a few guys getting a bit more after the workout. Here's what happened in between.

0545, No FNGs so off we go for a quick parking lot tour before circling up for some Good Mornings, Windmills and Steve Earles.

Another quick Mosey to the parking lot at the top of the greenway that leads down to the lake.

**The Thang  
**Partner up. As P1 starts on the called exercise P2 runs the hill in a variety of ways.

Round 1: 150 CDD; Regular run down the hill, backward run up  
Round 2: 300 Imperial Walkers; 2 laps up & down the hill  
Round 3: 150 Big Boy Situps; Regular down, Bear Crawl up  
Round 4: 300 SSH; 2 laps up & down the hill

Quick set of Control Freak Merkins and then Mosey back to the flag.

**Mary**  
Low Slow Flutters, 100s

**COT  
**Prayers for Hotspot's daughter as she gets back to college
