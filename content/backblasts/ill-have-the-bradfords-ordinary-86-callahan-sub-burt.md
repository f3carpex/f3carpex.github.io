_This BB is generally what we did this am...some stuff is out of order and other info is made up.   But I wrote a BB._

Tank Top Thursday.   Bag O' Tanks in the House.   73 degrees, 92% Humidity, No Wind.  Clear.

20 dudes in the lot, including Wonk, the other GodFather of CarPex along with CK (not Captain Kirk...although we now see Captain more than CK...maybe CK needs a ride).  Nice to see you Wonk.

A few completed the EC Meow Mile, including  our FNG who came a bit early and jumped on the EC run.  Next thing you know he will be doing ECPs etc.   More about Jason later.

All the MEN came hoping for a Cally Cluster Q.  No Cally.  Next Best Cluster Q took the lead.   Disappointment set in amongst the group.

And we are off...

**Warm Up**

Quick jog over the adjacent lot just in case Cally was running a few minutes late.   We have an FNG....Jason Darden...a youth minister and friend of Banjos.  Wonk delivered the disclaimer.

SSH, Merkins, SSH, Burt Jacks, Merkins, etc.    Still no Cally.  We move on.

**Thing**

Out of the lot, take a left down the street...stop at the Mayton Inn...no one in the group attending the Cheerwine sponsored, sold out, Inspire event last evening at the Mayton...hmm Cheerwine inspired menu and none of our DTC men attended...what does that say about the Mayton?

We do Al Gore Squats in cadence x 15.  Head back to in the other direction, because I really want to go to the pocket park.  Stop at the corner  and circle up for planks and a merkin.   Hold the plank, each man does a merkin and says his F3 Name....I try to do this when we have FNG's so he (and us) can get to know each other a little better.

Head over to the street by the tracks.  Prisoner run, Prisoner Squats, Prisoner Quick Feet, Curb Merkins, Prisoner Quick Feet and Curb Merkins.    Proceed to the pocket park.  Circle up.

Planks and 2 Merkins...around the circle; this time with Hospital Names.   FNG Jason calls himself FNG....dude is going to be great.    Then some Mary...LBC's, Low Slow Flutters, Rosalita and Hello Dolly with none other than Hello Kitty playing Cally.   Perrrfect.

On the wall....Dips (Hi Liter showing off the one leg dip...such a dip move)...so we all do them.  Derkins (has he not been fired as the Maryland Football Coach yet?), Irkins...we did ~15 -20 of each....Lunge walk to the other side.  Repeato, Dips, Derkins and Irkins.   Lunge Walk back.

Circle up for some Jack Webb.    Merkins and 1-4 Hal Eh Loo Yahs.      Puck showing off like Hi-Liter by doing his arm raises with knees on the hard stone vs the nice grass.  WTPuck.   We stopped at 5 and headed back to the street.  Prisoner Quick Feet and Curb Merkins...did we do two sets?  Who cares...let's go with yes (64% of all BB's contain some level of exaggeration).

Mosey back to the Fidelity Bank plaza to wrap up the Jack Webb....let's cluster this a bit and do the last five in random order.  9, 7, 10, 8, 6 or something like that.....most of the dudes were confident I would screw this up.  Did I tell you about the dollar bill Jack Webb over at Pure Gold....use a dollar bill, do JW's with the serial number numbers.

Back to the street.  Billy run to the Flag.   Jiggly Puff is Fast.

Circle up.  I forgot what we did.  Lets go with 25 LBC's, 100 Merkins, and 25 Wolverines.    We did not do any burpees today.

**COT**

Count and Name-a-ramas.   We named FNG Jason Darden....Red Lobster....as the Darden Restaurant Group founded Red Lobster (but guess what...the spun the brand off a few years ago....the name is what it is though).  Welcome Red Lobster.    Nice work!   Here are the other brands.  https://www.darden.com/restaurants/our-brands     Could have gone with Capitol Grill?  Olive Garden, Yard House????

We had a few announcements (do ya'll read the BB for announcements....I hope not) and we had several prayer requests.   Wonk took us out.

Later.  Its always a pleasure to sub.
