**In celebration of Flag Day, the PAX at Dante’s Peak paid tribute to America and Old Glory on a crisp Apex morning.**

**Warm up**

A quick mosey around most of the soccer field – circle up in the middle

- SSHs
- Sir Fazios – front and back
- Merkins
- Plank jacks
- Good mornings

**The Thang**

Playing off of the June 14th date (6-14), YHC developed a beatdown encompassing these numbers and A-M-E-R-I-C-A. The PAX enjoyed a tour of both sides of Apex Nature as we stopped intermittently to do the following:

- A: 6 Agassis (tennis court suicides) with 14 Alternating Shoulder Taps in between
- M: 3 sets of 14 Mountain Climbers; 3 sets of 14 Monkey Humpers
    - Bonus 13 merkings (for the stripes) in between
- E: 6 sets of El Capitan (lunge, hands on ground, lunge) – 14 in each set
- R: 6 sets of Rapid Fire Rocks (curls, triceps, overhead press – x2)
- I: 2 sets of Imperial Walkers; 2 sets of Iron Mikes (4-count lunge jump) – 14 in each set
- C: 2 sets of Carolina Dry Docks; 2 sets of Crunchy Frog – 14 in each set
- A: 2 sets of American Hammers; 2 sets of Al Gore – 14 in each set

Due to the Q’s overzealousness, we had to cut down the last three station sets from 3-to-2

**Mary**

American Hammers, Al Gores, 100s – have a nice day

**Announcements**

Green Mile soft launch tomorrow; I honestly don’t remember the rest

**Prayers / Praises**

Praises – The Commish’s daughter’s graduation; prayers for Parker’s father-in-law

Chipper took us out.
