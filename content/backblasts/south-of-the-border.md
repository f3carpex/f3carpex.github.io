YHC started posting at Flying Circus when I first joined F3 in March of ’19, since moving the Durm’ I have not been back to post with Carpex but on a couple of occasions. My new year’s resolution is therefore to post and Q some of the Carpex AOs in WCary.

  
Warm-up: 5 GM Cadence, 10 Windmills Cadence, 15 Side SHUFFLE Hops (Side Straddle Hops just sounds weird), 20 Mtn. Climbers

  
Main Event: YHC thought the PAX needed a good run in to start the morning, however we needed to carry some weight as we went, so YHC made use of the coupon Indian Run (I will claim I created it until someone proves otherwise). It is a standard Indian Run formation, however the PAX at the front of the line is carrying a weight. When the next PAX runs to the front of the line, the weight is handed to that HIM, and so on.

  
Nature Boy and Dirty Bomb tried to start a “slow guy line” but Kilmer and YHC made short work of that.

  
Once we arrived at the far side of the AO, we did an 4-Corner escalator burpee routine (Swag had pioneered this apparently). Each corner increased the Burpee count by five, so the PAX completed 50 burpees in this rotation. There was significant mumblechatter regarding this!  
  
Next, the PAX were Balls to the Wall in a single line, the PAX at either end would hold one of the weights above their head for a 10 count, then hand the weight to the next PAX. Everyone stayed in BttW until the weights went to the opposite end of the line they started at.

  
The PAX were then reminded that every escalator has to de-escalate, so the PAX did the same Burpee routine in reverse. When the PAX finished those 50 burpees, we did a short Indian Bear Crawl, during which every PAX bear crawled and the PAX at the back had to bear crawl to the front of the line. PAX modified as necessary to lunge walks.

  
Finally, PAX went back to BttW to complete the same routine as before, however this time the PAX did 10 over head presses with their weight.

  
We did our Coupon Indian Run back to the flag for the Mary.

  
Mary: 5 count Merkin Ring of Fire.

  
CoT: Pigeon’s Grandfather is in the hospital, prayers for speedy recovery.
