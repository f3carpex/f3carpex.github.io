YHC has been out of Carpex for the past few days exploring F3 out west in St. Louis and was really looking forward to being back home. Since there isn't much to do outside of work when traveling YHC was advertising the upcoming beat down all week on slack. And let's just say that the adverting brought out the numbers - 32 PAX joined my in south Carpex on this fine Friday morning. It may have been the crisp 58 degrees that brought the crowd but you could still attribute the large bunch to the fine advertising YHC provided this week.

Start with a quick Pledge of Allegiance at 5:45 on the dot and we were off.

Since it was a bit chilly we did an extended run for the warm up around to the basketball court with a quick stop at the top of the hill for the 6.

Warm up:

- 5 burpee OYO while we wait on the crowd to arrive
- 15 x SSH
- 15 x Imperial Walkers
- 10 x Mountain Climbers
- 10 x Merkins OMD

Mosey over to the park entrance.

Thing 1:

If you happened to read the backblast from the workout out west YHC lead on Wednesday you may recognize this was a direct repeat of the 11s.

- Run to the bend near the parking spots and do 10 burpees
- Run back to park entrance for 1 Bobby Hurley
- Repeat

Thing 2:

YHC had planned for some rock work and pull ups but due to crowd changed it up and repeated a trick we learned last week at DZ thanks to Liverpool. We mosey to the soccer field.

- Start with 1 merkin and 1 squat
- Run to other side of field (side lines, not end to end) for 2 merkins and 2 squats
- Continue increasing by 1 for 7 minutes

Circle up in the middle of the field for

- American Hammers x 15
- Proper Boat/Canoe lead by Biner. I think he could do that all morning.
- Asked Crimson to call an exercise and he called American Hammers again!
- Asked Hotty Toddy to call an exercise and he called Boat/Canoe following Crimson's lead
- YHC called Have a Nice Day to finished up. Unfortunately, the PAX need a reminder that Have a Nice Day is supposed to be silent. There was no silencing this group!

COT:

- Prayers for Grease and his family losing his father
- Prayers for Beetle's friend that has a recent cancer diagnosis
- Announcements
    - Q school Wednesday at Bond Park
    - DP closed next week for convergence at DZ for Carpex 5 year anniversary. If that is too far, pack a lunch and plan a clown car!

NMS:

- It is great to lead this bunch but I still hate writing backblasts.
- Crimson does have a car and can drive, but he didn't see the need to drive since I was back in town.
- Franklin brought a fair amount of mumble chatter. As did others. It was actually a normal amount but it seemed like a lot since there was much at the St. Louis workouts.
- We get better because of each other. Thanks for help me get stronger!
- It is great to be home. This is a great group and I am thankful for the opportunity to lead!
