Time for this Duck to visit Wolverine, the Gloomiest Gloom in the Gloom.

**Warm-Up** Mosey from the dark parking lot to the other dark parking lot and circle up for cherry pickers, Sir Fazios, imperial walkers, copperhead merkins and copperhead squats.

**The Thang** Mosey over to the church parking lot and line up for 10-10 sprints. 10 monkey humpers, 10 dry docks, run to the first light pole and back; 10 monkey humpers, 10 dry docks, run to the second light pole and back; 10 monkey humpers, 10 dry docks, run to the third light pole and back. Repeato with Supermans and LBCs, squats and merkins, mountain climbers and Homer-to-Marge.

Mosey back to the bottom of the dark parking lot for Jacob's Ladder with burpees at the top.

**Mary** LBCs, box cutters, dying cock-a-roaches, cox butters, Freddie Mercury.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  8 **Name-a-rama**:  4 RESPECT, 4 meh, 0 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for folks who have lost their jobs recently, prayers for Loom's daughter, prayers for our leaders and our country this week, prayers that we judge each other by who we are and not by what categories we're in. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**  It was inspiring to be around this group of men this morning, all of them accelerating in some way. Big Red - taking an extra lap around the soccer field before heading home Blue and Out - getting out in the cold more than he used to Build-a-Bear - kicking ass again after recovering from heart surgery Burt - getting after it after his Covid quarantine Loom - signing up to Q more often Saban - running 2.5 miles before and after the workout WWW - being HIMMY like he always is If you start your day off around men like that you can't help but get better. Love you guys!
