A few weeks ago YHC and WWW traveled north to the The Farm to help celebrate Spit Valve's Q Week. The first half was a typical, well executed and thorough beatdown, but the second half was something new for us. It was a game of Ultimate Frisbee, with penalties doled out whenever the frisbee reached the end zone or touched the ground. It was thrilling and on our drive back we agreed we definitely had to bring it back to Carpex.

**Warm-Up**

Mosey down to the circle for side straddle hops, imperial walkers, Sir Fazio arm twirly things, plank jacks and merkins.

**The Thang**

Mosey over to the beautiful astroturf field and split up, black shirts on one team, everyone else on the other. The rules are pretty simple. Advance the frisbee to the end zone by tossing it to a teammate. Players are allowed two steps when catching the frisbee, but it has to be caught in the end zone for a score. After each score the scoring team performs five burpees, the scored upon team performs seven burpees. Every time the frisbee hits the ground the PAX closest to it call ten repetitions of the exercise of their choice. Got it? Let's play!

The black team jumped out to a quick lead, but the red team fought back. The PAX were surprisingly effective at both throwing and catching the frisbee. The disc hit the ground only a few times so it was a smooth game, uninterrupted by penalty exercises after every other toss. In the end the red team scored on the last play of the game to secure the victory. But know this, there were no losers on that field today, only winners.

**Mary**

Mosey back to the flag and circle up for a quick round of Mary led by WWW.

**COT**

**Count-a-rama**:  23 **Name-a-rama**:  5 RESPECTs, 17 meh, 1 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for Open Out's friends and their young daughter who has spent half of her six weeks of life in the hospital (find Georgia May's Journey on Facebook for more details), prayers for Hot Spot's friend who is trying to quit smoking, prayers for a quick recovery for Hot Spot after his tumble during the game, praises for Sooey and his back feeling better, continued prayers for Disco's M and her health. **BOM**:  WWW took us out

**NMS**

Thanks to Spit Valve for so many things. He introduced us to this workout, he drove down from Wake Forest to join us, and during the warm-up he figured out that putting the black shirts on one team split the PAX as evenly as possible. He's a true HIM.

If you're looking for a reason to travel to other regions, this is it. You get to meet and hang out with awesome guys, and you just might come home with a great idea for a workout.

We hope other Q's at Dante's Peak, Field of Dreams and Flying Circus will copy this workout. It definitely works better on the astroturf fields. But get to it soon, once we lose the daylight we're just a bunch of guys running around in the dark.

Hotspot had an EC run while Cataracts, Frisco, Red Ryder, Rooney, Theismann and WWW each knocked out 50 EC pull-ups.

This was a fun workout, but it was tiring. Thanks for letting us lead this morning, we hope you enjoyed it as much as we did.
