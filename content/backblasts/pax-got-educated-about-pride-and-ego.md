Warm-up: GM, Sir Fazio, calf stretch.

Mosey over to where YHC laid the bricks. The PAX was surprised and now it was time for the thang. QIC calls for PAX to partner up.

Thang 1:

Partner 1 does **P**resses with coupon x25. Walk to next island for 25 more presses. Repeato for 1 more island. Partner 2 runs until P1 gets to third island and completes the presses. Flap jack heading back to starting point.

Next is **R**ows with coupons. Same style as presses.

We get some rest from the coupons. QIC get the PAX to line up for **I**nch Worm N’daiyes for x10

**D**iamond Merkins x10

Get the coupons for **E**xtensions. P2 runs same pattern as the presses and rows.

Put the coupons back and mosey back to the flag for thang 2.
