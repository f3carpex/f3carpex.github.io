As I look around at the pax, I realize there are some new faces to me. Introductions were made to Carvana and Skipper, both here to Ruck. Noticeably missing was Fort Mills’ Dirty Hairy who was recently seen blotting out the sun, sporting his newly minted CARPEX™ Hello Kitty officially licensed gear, and was invited to attend N.W. Carpex’s premier High Tempo bootcamp. 🤐

A highly abbreviated disclaimer was shared....man can Hi-Liter talk, why don’t you lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance?

We dive into 2 burpees at each of the many parking lot lines and then circle up for warm up: wind mills, (Really, is Hi-Liter still talking🤣) 5 burpees OYO, good am, runners stretch.

YHC shares the initial plans of running to the library so that pax can determine how they might want to modify.  By the time we finished we ran north to the library, north to Dominion Hill Drive, back to library, east to Valley Side Ct, back to library, west to Grace Hodge Dr, back to library, back to flag. In route, at each stop and at Heritage Park Drive, pax completed 5 Burpee’s, 10 merkins, 15 monkey humpers. During the run, pax were encouraged to:

1. Pick up the six once faster runners arrived at the library intersection.
2. At start and each convergence at the library, pax were provided directions, modify as necessary. 

Circle up. 

Pax were asked to share either how they have grown through their children or learned wisdom from their children. Pax responded with a plethora of responses including patience, grace, guidance, perseverance, wisdom, perspective, and a host of others, provided in much more detail. 

Announcements: 24 hour prayer vigil, work trip to Burgaw tomorrow - see Coney or Hello Kitty.

Lots of prayer concerns including my oldest daughter and her job prospects. YHC took us out

18 pax: 14 campers and 4 ruckers (Carvana,Hotcakes, Geek Squad, Skipper)
