We are officially three months away from BRR, and YHC isn't in shape for that at the moment.  Time to get to work.  And on this insanely muggy morning we have 22 other HIMs with the same idea.  One of them is not Francois, who is ducking this thing despite being a Site Q.

No FNGs, although Free Solo is apparently back for workout #2.  Pledge.  A short mosey to the side parking lot and circle up for a warm up.

- 7 GM IC
- 27 SSH IC
- 17 Imperial Walkers IC
- Calf Stretch
- 17 Merkins OMD
- Calf Stretch
- 17 Merkins OMD
- Runner's Stretch

Mosey to the greenway and proceed to Kildaire Farm Road.  Hang a right on Kildaire and head to the Loch Highlands red light where we do some LSF IC to let everyone catch up.   

We run 7s on this hill with the top designated as the Hemlock Bluffs Nature Preserve Parking Lot.  Single Count LBCs x 10 on the bottom.  World's Worst Merkins at the top.

Mosey back to the flag the same way we came.  A bit of Mary and we are done.  Props to everyone out there today.  That was 3.5+ miles of distance and a mile of verticality in some very unpleasant weather, and everyone crushed it. 

Announcements include Braveheart's graduation today and Raleigh Service Day on June 19.  And something else I feel like I'm forgetting.  YHC took us out.
