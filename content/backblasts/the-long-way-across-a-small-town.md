4 HIMs gathered round the flag at Sovereign Grace Church for the finest high tempo workout in Apex on Mondays. Is this high tempo, or is it running? Or is it both? Yogi has the Q and moves us along.

### Warm Up

Run to Hunter Street Park

### The Thang

Do 10 burpees OYO, then sets of WWIIs, Irkins, Dips. Take a lap around the soccer field, meet back at the skate park. 10 burpees OYO, then sets of American Hammers, Merkins, and Dips. Take a lap around the soccer field. 10 burpees OYO, sets of WWIIs, Irkins, and Dips. Partner carry race the length of the soccer field, then mosey the rest of the way around the pickle. Run back to the flag.
