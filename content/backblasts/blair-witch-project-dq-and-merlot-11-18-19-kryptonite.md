Several guys did an EC run, I think it was Michelob, Squatter, GTL, Denali and Oofta. Hello Kitty and YHC did an EC scouting run. 15 were present at 5:30, a brief disclaimer was disclaimed and follow me..

The Warmup:  
Jog up Regency Parkway, make a right into the gravel driveway into the woods. Circle up in the power line right of way for some warm-up activities.  
The Thang:  
Jog into the woods behind the little cell tower thing and find the trail. Make a left on the single track trail and run deep into the pitch dark forest. And keep running. And keep running. Go up and down some of the bmx/mtn. bike ramp structures, run up one and realize the gap at the top is a little too big to jump so turn around. Stop and do some merkins or something and keep running deeper into the forest. Generally repeat this for about 1.5 miles.  
The Thang 2: bear crawl up a steep cliff in the woods in the dark, climb over a major fence at the top all Navy Seal/Special Ops like, tip toe along the 4" wide ridge at the top of a 40-foot cliff that plunges into a swamp, like the one that one in Rambo with the leaches.  
The Thang 3: Pop up in classic suburbia and do some merkins or something in the parking lot of the apartment complex that is under construction. Run past the Dairy Queen drive through, make a left on NC State Road 1010 (aka Ten Ten). Make a left into Southchase.  
The Thang 4: We are about 2 miles from the flag and its 6:00. We're gonna need to step up the pace a little. Wind around through the neighborhood, stop after a pretty good hill to do some squats to wait on the Six and for Blowout to feed the grubs in the neighbor's grass some Merlot. Get back to the flag less than 2-minutes late.
