4 for the EC run.  First morning of the Fall the was brisk. It was a nice change and I maybe should have worn my gloves.

11 for the main event.  Oofta pulled in just in time.

**Warm Up -** Reverse Shut In warm up. 25 SSH, 20 Merkins, 15 IW, 10 GM

**Half Dora at the Shelter -** Partner up for 50 Box Jump Derkins as Term Paper called them.  Derkin with a hop down and up to the bench.  100 Box Jumps/Step Up, 150 Elevated Should Taps.  Partner runs around the bathroom and switches.

**Lunges/Wall Sit -** So it is really called people's chair but I forget.  40 lunges, people's chair for 5 count for everyone, then repeat with 30, 20, and 10 lunges.

**Crazy Eight -** Snake through the parking lot stopping at each turn for a set of 8 reps for a total of 8 times in a figure 8 pattern.  Spiderman Merkins and then CDDs.

**Pull Ups, Merkins, and Dips -** Max reps for an undisclosed amount of time.  About 5 Mins. In hindsight, it might have been good to call out the time limit. I got in at least 30 pull ups so that was my goal.

**Waterfall Crazy Eight -** We had time for one more crazy Eight so we did Inch Worm Merkins counting down to one per Term Papers suggestion.  Good thing because there was no way we were doing 8 at each turn.

Run around the parking lot to get 2 miles in and meet at the flag.

COT - 11 (4 for EC)

I briefly shared the beginning of **Ephesians 5:25-31.** I love these verses as they are always a helpful reminder and challenge for the purpose of marriage.

_25 Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, 26 that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, 27 so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish.\[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A25-31&version=ESV#fen-ESV-29315a "See footnote a")\] 28 In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 29 For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church, 30 because we are members of his body._ _31 “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh_.”

- Shout out to Bunny from Knoxville for posting 4 times this week.
- Coffee with Oofta is still a big hit!
- I didn't run in circles around the parking lot.
- Still have the record for that!
- 25 or so?
- Not really sure and no one cares.

Thanks for letting me lead.
