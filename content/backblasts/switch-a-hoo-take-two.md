After Yahoo's switch-a-hoo (Shut-In coined term) last week I had to return the favor due to him being out of town. Arrived early and hid my mini-van containing cinder blocks in the main area. Started at 0530.

### Warmup

Ran to the main promenade grass area, and warmed up with:  
\- Imperial Walkers  
\- Sir Fazio Fwd  
\- Seal Claps  
\- Sir Fazio Reverse  
\- Merkins

### Thang 1: Manmakers, Merkins and Swings

Partnered up and grabbed cinder blocks from the mini-van. While on partner did 10 manmakers, 20 merkins on the block and 30 swings the other partner ran up the steps around the back (correction from Hermes technically the front) of Shake Shack and back down to the grass. This lasted for about 30 minutes. YHC got through 7 rounds. Everyone complained and groaned which brought me great joy. Hermes especially complained about the lack of taper friendliness.

### Thang 2: Ring of Fire

All the PAX circled up and we did: Freddie Mercuries, Low Slow Flutters and LBCs. Next each PAX did five squat thrusters while the other PAX plank hold. Mosey back to the flag for some quick stretching.

### COT

17 PAX, 1 Respect  
Announcements:  
\- HGTV looking at new Saturday AO for any interested  
\- The Mule CSAUP  
Prayers:  
\- Clear Cut's grandfather diagnoses with dementia  
\- Coronavirus  
  
YHC took us out. Always good heading to AO with a group of PAX I don't see regularly. Always nice when my fellow POGLers Hamm and Short Circuit tag along.
