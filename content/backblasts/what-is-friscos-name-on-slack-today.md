FYI Bartman, this is a 5:45 start AO and not 5:30. 
FYI Frisco, this is a 5:45 start AO and not 5:46.

I apologize for all of the Frisco attention in this one. He attempted to start a brotherly quarrel on Slack between Water Wings and me a day before the workout.

Mosey behind the bathroom building to hide from Frisco who showed up late, but he found us anyways. Then continued the mosey to the left lot for warm-ups.

**Warmup**

10 Good Mornings  
10 Daisy Pickers  
10 Imperial Walker (Q was sure to subconsciously close eyes when facing Frisco)  
10 Overhead Claps  
10 "Jumping Jacks" for the Q who couldn't remember Side Straddle Hop

**Thang 1**

Mosey to the right parking lot for a series pyramid series of deconstructed burpees:  
  
Merkins @ bottom of hill, Donkey Kicks (permission was given to modify as necessary because I must have skipped that at the start of the workout with no FNGs) @ top, Sumo Squats @ bottom, Bobby Hurleys @ top

Starting with 5 of each exercise, the 10, 15, 20, and then reducing by 5 back to 5 of each because stopping at 20 wouldn't have taken long enough. Frisco claimed I was taking out brotherly frustration on Water Wings by continuing the pyramid down.

**Thang 1**

Mosey back to the left parking lot:  
Bear crawl part of the way, 10 mountain climbers, bear crawl some more, 10 plank jacks  
Lung walk to the end, 10 squats, lung walk back some, 10 Star Jumps

This is when the PAX started picking exercises because my planned exercises ran out, so memory is a little fuzzy from here.

Grape vine some then 10 of something squat related called out by the PAX  
Grape vine in the other direction some and then 10 Lieutenant Dan squats  
  
Bear crawl some then eskimo merkins. There was some more moving around and Frisco pulling some crazy shoulder tap merkins that he's been apparently waiting to lead for some time because he knew exactly what exercise he wanted the PAX to do.

**Mary**

Exercise called out first by TANG who was complaining about all the quad exercises, so he called for some side shuffle toe touch thing.  
Water Wings called Superman/Banana, unfortunately it wasn't wet or raining to get the full enjoyment out of it.

Continuing around the circle for any PAX that had not yet had the opportunity to call out an exercise.
