If there ever was a joke about Twinkies...it would never get old.

My VQ was last Friday, and a good time was had.

**Warm Up**

Good morning (it was!), Sir Fazio front and back, Seal Claps, Michael Phelps OYO, and Runner and Calf stretches. Mozy-ied over to the driveway next to the parking garage.

**Thang 1**

11s on the driveway, featuring Burpees and Star Jumps (like you've seen a ghost)

**Thang 2**

Ladders

Carioca to the furthest light post, followed by 10 Partner 'mericans. Repeat.

Sprint to the next closest light post, followed by 10 Carolina Dry Docks. Repeat.

Lunge walk to the closest light post, followed by 10 hand stand pushups. Repeat.

**Mary**

Homer to Marge, LBCs, American Hammers and 100s (led by Meatloaf's 2.0, Einstein!)

Count-a-rama, name-a-rama, COT, and Twinkie distribution.

Thanks to all who made it to my VQ.
