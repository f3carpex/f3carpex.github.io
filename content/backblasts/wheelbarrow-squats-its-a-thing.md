Since I needed to work off some of the extra Thanksgiving helpings and the frustrations of spending almost 5 days with my in-laws, we started the day with a little EC Run. I was joined by Michelob, Denali & Chanticleer.

0530 Here we go.

We take the long way around the lake to the bottom of the hill at the large parking lot.

**Warm Up** Good Morning x 5. That's enough. Let's get to it.

**Thang 1** Partner up. P1 - SSH; P2 - run backwards up the hill regular down. Flip Flop. When both partners have gone, get in wheelbarrow position. P1 - Merkins x10; P2 - Squats. Flip Flop. Repeato

Run up the hill into the large parking lot

**Thang 2** 7 Corners (It's like 4 corners done twice but on the 2nd loop we only got 3 corners. 4+3=7.) Run hard to each corner and begin a called exercise, when the last man shows up they call cadence x 10 of the exercise, then run to next corner. Exercises performed: Alt. Shoulder tap, Dive Bombers, Jump Lunges, Freddie Mercury, CDD, LBC, Jump Squats.

**Thang 3** Run to the far end of the parking lot and starting at the entrance perform Suicides stopping at each of the 5 trees. There was a short debate on whether the trees where in islands or peninsulas. At each tree perform a Burpee, increasing by 1 each tree. When back at the start, perform American Hammers x10.

Indian Run back to the flag.

**Mary** Boat/Canoe, 100s

**COT** Carpex Christmas Party 12/13 South Wake CSAUP 12/15 No Prayers/Praises

YHC took us out with a quote from Coach John Wooden
