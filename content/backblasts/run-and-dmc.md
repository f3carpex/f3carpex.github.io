I don't mind cold weather so long as I don't have to scrap frost off my windshield. What does that have to do with the workout? Nothing, except that it was cold. It was cold until we got going. But how far were we going? All the way to CC Jones park. This is great little park for both workouts and for the family. Definitely recommend taking the family there if you are in the area. Where is CC Jones park? About a mile away from Hunter Street Park on the exact opposite side of downtown Apex. We have a lot of work to do. If we don't get started we might not make it back in time. So let's get going.

No FNGs, though that would be impressive to post for the first time in 25 degree weather, so we say the Pledge.

We embark on our journey through DT Apex and circle up behind Halle Cultural Arts Center for the warm up.

Warm-up - Nancy Kerrigan, Steve Earle, Cotton Pickers, Dive Bombers, J-Lo and the Good Morning (of course)

Continue the mosey through DT and take a right after Apex Baptist on Holleman St. Arrive at CC Jones parking lot for Thang 1.

Thang1 - DMC Ladder- Partnering up (for moral support only at this point) we line up parallel to the parking lines. D- Duck Walk the width of one parking space, M - Merkin perform 5 merkins, C - Crawl Bear back to the start. Repeat except to the second line and add 5 more merkins. Repeat to 3 then 4 then come back down to 1 to complete the ladder.

Mosey over to the swing set. They would not have built it so short if they didn't want us to do pull-ups from it.

Thang2 - 100 x 3 - With your partner: 100 Pull-ups or Underdog, 100 J-Lo's, 100 Shakera's. Partner 2 runs a quick loop around the playground to the picnic table for 10 4-count Fluttering Supermans and then relieve your partner.

With not much time left we start heading back. Couple stops along the way with one being utilized for a drill called Foot Fire. Quick tiny run in place steps and do and up/down on my down.

With one minute to spare we arrive back and Hunter Street Park for a more superior quarterback led Mary by Staubach.
