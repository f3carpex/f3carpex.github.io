Nice morning.   44 degrees.   Crystal clear.  Respect Week.   The original Cary AO.  26 HIMs.

The DZ crew was complete this am with Cally and Large in attendance.   Today we observe Veterans Day and at DZ we are fortunate to be the closest AO to Cary’s Veterans Freedom Park.   Cally took us there a few years back...so we had to go back.

A little Rip Tide Pearl on a String was planned for the 1.1 mile trek out and the 1.1 mile trek back.   The return trip brought us back through the park on the trail.   Bartman, Katniss, Flacco and Biner had Ruck Sacks.

**The Thang**

Circle up at the Flags - we had three - for the Pledge of Allegiance led by Hi-Liter who has introduced the Pledge into our workouts on a regular basis.   We welcomed Rainman (an old pal from Raleigh) to DZ and we were off.

Here is what we did.....we ran and we stopped for pain stations.   We stopped about 10 times on the way out and another 8 on the way back.   We did Merkins, SSH,  Man Makers, Burbees, Burt Jacks, Squats, Pulsing Squats, Squat Jumps, Prisoner Runs, Lunges, and Planks along the way in a variety of counts with many 22’s for the 22 Vets who committed suicide daily (thanks to Kitty for the reminder).

At the park we circled up at the Flags for 22 merkins and I read a prayer (below and sourced online...ya’ll know for sure I could not compose something so eloquent).  After the prayer we took a quick lap around the inside of the monument and did 22 dips and 22 derkins and then headed out to return home.  We did not disrupt the many little flags surrounding the lot and the inside of the monument.

More running and more pain stations.

Back at the North Cary Park we circled up for a quick Hello Dolly (had to do it with Cally in attendance) and that was it.

**COT**

Count-a-Rama, Name-a-Rama, a few announcements, Prayers and Cally took us out.

GREAT Morning Men.  I can’t tell you how important YOU and F3 are to me.  Awesome starting the day with you HIM.

Here is the **prayer** read at the Memorial. (I will locate the source and add to this Post)

Freedom is powerful. It's a gift. A treasure.

The most significant, important gifts in life are always worth fighting for. And often, they come with a great price.  They are not free. Somewhere along the way, someone paid dearly for the liberties we enjoy so freely today. But sometimes, we forget. It’s easy to take them for granted. We enjoy freedom, but most of us alive today, have always had it. We may not even be fully aware of just how many men and women have paid dearly for the gifts we enjoy today. The price was paid through many long years.

This is a day to unite, to remember and pray, to show our gratitude for so many who have fought on behalf of our country. For all those who have protected our nation, for the men and women in uniform, together, we say "Thank You."

There’s great power and strength in the loyalty of your service, because of these things: There's power in unity and standing strong together. There's power in fighting on behalf of our nation, and for those who cannot fight for themselves. There's power in rising up in courage, pursuing victory for what is right. There's power in knowing that God Himself fights on our behalf. There's power in prayer and in the One who sets us truly free.

Thank you for reminding us that there’s incredible love and sacrifice displayed, when one is willing to stand strong, and fight for freedom.

This service of love and sacrifice on behalf of all people, points us directly to the greatest love of all, the very gift and sacrifice of Christ. Our Savior was willing to pay the ultimate price, so that we can live free. Forever.

“Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!” 2 Cor. 9:15

Freedom is powerful. It's a gift. A treasure.
