Thanks to you guys, I'm a better man at 51 than I was at a decade or two ago. That's an understatement, to be sure, but I won't bore you with details. Just wanted to say that my body is sore but my spirits high, and I attribute most of that to the excellent group of HIMs that I've come to associate with.

Fight the good fight, finish the race, keep the faith.

God bless!
