**Pre-Blast**

- 15 men grew stronger together physically, relationally, and spiritually at Apex’s premier limited run work out on Wednesday that meets at Sovereign Grace Church, Tortoises. Incredible extended COT with several men sharing about their struggles and victories related to mental health. After a raise of hands, we realized that virtually everyone in the circle had dealt with one or more of the issues we discussed in their life. I especially loved seeing the young guys learning from the older guys who’ve really been through. So proud to be part of this brotherhood! Let’s continue to trust in Jesus and find hope!

**The Warmup**

- Pledge of Allegiance at the flag
- Mixed run around both lots.
