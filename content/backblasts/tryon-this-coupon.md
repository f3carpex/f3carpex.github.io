YHC was excited to Q at Tortoises as I had not posted there since the early days of its formation. I knew that they had coupons there, but wanted to introduce new ones. Many thanks to Bartman for bringing most of them. He said he had 6 or 7, which I thought would be plenty as I intended to use one for every two PAX. By 5:20, there were already 10 or so present, so I needed to gather a few extra from the Tortoise supply and Yogi was able to provide an extra ruck

Coupons utilized

- Four 30 lb rucks
- Two 40 lb sandbags
- One 60 lb sandbag
- Two 30-ish pound cinder blocks
- One 35 lb kettle bell

Since ½ the PAX would be stationary, it gave me the opportunity to add tunes, which always makes high numbers of random exercises more enjoyable. Theme – songs with Run in the title since I was told we couldn’t run (much). Options were not plentiful and I left Runnin’ with the Devil off as it didn’t seem fitting with location

Playlist

Run Through the Jungle – CCR

Run Around – Blues Traveler

Run Like Hell – Pink Floyd

Running Down a Dream – Petty

Born to Run – Springsteen

I Ran – A Flock of Seagulls (80s nonsense but I was limited for options)

The Long Run – Eagles

Runnin’ with the Pack – Bad Company

No One to Run With – Allman Brothers

 

It was great to post with guys I hadn’t met before - 529 (close to merlot spillage at one point), Toothless, Spartan as well as FNG – Winkelman

Had a little trouble regaining order during announcements as there was a lot of discussion related to Bread Breaking and whether to cancel Tortoises or try to beat it over there. Site Q Yogi made the call to move Tortoises to SNS, which is a great move and he was finally convinced that it didn’t need to still start at 5:30.

Blue and Out - The tortoise is a cartoon image but it is pretty cool, so order one.

Men- it was a honor and a pleasure to lead 20 with a purpose today
