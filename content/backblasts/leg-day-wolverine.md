Was pleasantly surprised when I checked the weather this morning -- phone said it wasn't raining! Yeah! However, when getting outside it was misting just enough to continue our amazing streak of wetness.... anyway we do say we love the gloom...

Here's what went down at Wolverine this moist morning:

Gather at the flag -- no FNGs but I got to meet Back Porch -- he has posted 3 days in a row after finding F3 last week -- way to go!

Warm-up jog around the pickle a couple of times, head up to the basketball court for our warm-up exercises -- good mornings, Abe Vagota's/Windmills, merkins, calf stretches, merkins, etc. Mosey out for Thang 1:

Run down to the tunnel and get a partner. Partner 1 stays put & alternates 10 merkins & 10 WWIIs while partner 2 runs up to the playground for 5 pull-ups, 5 squats, & 5 pull-ups. Switch-up & repeat. Next we did CDDs & dying cockroaches at the bottom & 30 count bar hangs on the bars. Repeat that one too. Don't go too far yet -- since Squatter is here, we need to do some 100's -- this time its 100 calf raises on the steps -- hopefully you'll feel them until Wednesday if you did 'em right. Mosey up to the shelter for thang 2.

Benchwork: a few rounds of: same leg step downs, dips, split squats, & irkins. Mosey back to the flay for....

Stand-up Mary: imperial walkers, side plank star crunch, have a nice day

CoT: counted 10 of us. Callahan did his combined impressions of Angry Shutty & "we are a minute over" Saban -- I hope I didn't ruin his day!

4 respects, 6 meh

Announcements: coffee at Crema, somebody said something about something calling them ....

Prayers/Praises: Loom's daughter, Wall family, Max's cancer. Hope Build-A-Bear's back feels better.

NMS: I've been working out the legs more to build strength -- I think the building the muscles & connective tissues is helping my running. Hope y'all don't mind the split squats -- huge for muscles around the knees & stabilizing the joint.

Really enjoyed the group this morning -- thang 1 took longer than I expected, but did give good fellowship time in the tunnel! Make it a great day!
