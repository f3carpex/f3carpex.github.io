**Warm-Up** Mosey over to the bank and circle up for warm-up. Hard to recall all of them but I'm pretty sure we did 4 burpess and 20 arm circles.

**The Thang** Mosey safely across Chatham Street and make our way down Academy Street doing five monkey humpers at the odd light poles and ten merkins at the even light poles.

Sevens at the Art Center, V-ups at the bottom of the stairs, bear crawl up the stairs, LBCs at the top, mosey down via the ramps on the sides.

Mosey back towards the flag stopping a few times for CLIMB (Crab cakes, Lunges, Imperial walkers, Mountain climbers, Burpees).

Finish up with each pax taking a turn to do pull-ups while the rest of the pax do merkins.

**Mary** Circle up at the flag for dying cock-a-roaches, Freddie Mercury, box cutters, side plank star crunches and burpees to the bell.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  8 **Name-a-rama**:  3 RESPECT, 5 meh, 1 HATE (and 1 dog) **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for Saban, his FIL and their family, prayers for Crimson, prayers for One Four's MIL Ginger. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**  If you missed Rush Hour tonight, you missed a good one. Great guys, beautiful weather, lots of fun.

I don't feel right counting VHS as a Respect, that dude runs around like a dang teenager.

Be careful doing pull-ups at Rush Hour. YHC almost busted my head open on one of those beams.

Thanks to Press On for providing cold refreshments after the workout.

And thanks to Kermit for the co-Q. We realized a while back that there was about a month where I'd be a Respect and he'd still be a Hate, so we paired up for a workout to celebrate. It's been a pleasure getting to know Kermit over the past few years and watching him grow from a quiet kid into one of the leaders of this region. Happy early birthday brother!

Love you guys!
