YHC was looking forward to some heavy rain this morning, unfortunately it held off. The rain wasn't there, but Peirogi was, and almost on time.

**Warm-Up** Mosey around to the back of the school and circle up for imperial walkers, daisy pickers, arm circles, copperhead merkins, copperhead squats and burpees.

**The Thang** Mosey over to the building with the stairs and count off 1s and 2s. A few rounds of one group climbing the stairs while the other group alternates hand release merkins and monkey humpers.

Mosey over to the astroturf field for 7s, Supermans on one side, Homer-to-Marge on the other.

Mosey over to the stairs at the track for 11s, merkins at the top, LBCs at the bottom.

Finish up at the basketball court with peoples chair, full court sprints and a few minutes of Mary.

**Mary** Dying cock-a-roaches, Homer-to-Marge, burpee burnout.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  15 **Name-a-rama**:  6 RESPECT, 9 meh, 0 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers lifted for our brothers who have unexpectedly lost friends recently, who are recovering from surgeries/accidents/illness, and whose families are going through tough times. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**  You think you're tougher than Ma Bell? Well you're not, and you know that, so pay attention to what he did this morning. After an EC run and the first bit of the workout he started feeling light-headed, so he took a break, caught his breath and drank some water before finishing with us. What lessons can we learn from this?

Push yourself, but don't hurt yourself.

Don't be bitches, but don't be stupid.

Be tough like Ma Bell, but be smart like Ma Bell.

Love you guys!
