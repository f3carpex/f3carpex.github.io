YHC and Chipper launch at 0500 for the first shirtless FWD EC run of the season.  It was glorious.  It also turns out that his watch will only report accurate mileage if we run this particular route backwards.  He continues to use this watch.

A very solid crowd of 15 for the ME, including Yoga Mat and Whirlie making their first appearances at FWD in a while.  Great to see these guys back.  No FNGs.  Pledge.  Mosey.  Circle up in the playground parking lot for a warm up.

Line up for an Indian Run on the greenway to the far side of the bridge over US-1.  Stop for ascending counts of LSF every time YHC gets back to the front.   

Next exercise is 11s on the S-Curve hill.  Fence Pull-Ups at the top and Ranger Merkins at the bottom.

Same Indian Run / LSF procedure for the run back, but we split into two lines to give everyone a few more opportunities to sprint.

We make a quick stop at the rock pile to get a bit extra work in.  YHC allows the group to call their favorite exercises, but Chipper hijacks the process.  It quickly becomes apparent that Chipper has a smaller rock than everyone else and is planning to use that fact to kill someone.  YHC ends the rock work.        

Mosey back to the flag and circle up for an abbreviated Mary:

- 10 Heels To Heaven IC
- Chilcutt on the roughest asphalt in Carpex as some veterans demonstrate the wisdom of using painted parking lines

The quest for 160 happens on Thursday.  Chain Gang launches Saturday.  TCP Sawgrass on Sunday.  Lunch at Corbett's today (this announcement is now useless to you unless you own a time machine).  McCants meal train.  Continued prayers for those affected by the Pandemic.  YHC took us out in a modified, semi-distanced, hybrid Ball of Man fashion.
