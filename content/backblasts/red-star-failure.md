**The Idea**: For my 4th F3 Anniversary Q Bounty Hunters and have real bounty to hunt.  
**The Plan**: Set some stuff out around the AO for the PAX to find and reward them if they find it.  
I looked around my house to see what would work - the first thing I found was a Russian flask that my sister gave me.  
She lived in Moscow for a couple of years and gave me this flask as a souvenir. Since there was a red star on the flask, I put red stars on an old tire and a ceramic planter, then hid them all in the darkness before the workout started.

Disco Duck read this note at the start:  
"_During your training today the bounty that you hunt can be identified by a red star. Bounty bought back to the flag intact will be rewarded."_

Cue The Mandalorian Soundtrack as we **warm up** with:  
1 Crimson Good Morning  
15 SSH  
Calf stretch L/R  
Runner's stretch L/R with pidgen L/R

**THANG 1**:  
Music continues as we mozy to Ample Storage and partner up to do a **_Dora Stora_**:  
100 Merkins  
200 Squats  
300 LBCs  
No one noticed the tire with the red star on it as we went back and forth 5 yards away from it.

**THANG 2:  
**Mozy to the empty office building at Peakway and Salem  
**_4 Corners for 4 Years of F3_**:  
10 Diamond Merkins  
10 Jump Squats  
10 Box Cutters  
10 L/R Shoulder Tap  
Increase number of reps by 10 every time around. We completed 3 rounds (not the 4 that I had planned) before time was up.  
Somewhere in the middle I gave enough clues that Hi-Liter found the ceramic planter with a few pounds of rocks in it and a big red star on the side.

We mozied back to the flag, going around the baseball fields where it is really dark.  
Someone had a headlamp, so I had hope that they would find the shiny flask I placed next to the batting cage. Nope. No one found it.

At the flag, after skate park empty bottle cleanup, for **Mary**:  
15 American Hammers  
15 Homer to Marge  
Have a Nice Day, accidently, before I realized the reward hadn't been delivered.  
40 burpees minus 10 burpees for every red star item found. We did 30.

**COT**: 11 HIMs, 2 Respects, 2 Honors  
YHC took us out with BOM

**NMS**:  
4 Years. Long enough to go thru High School, long enough to get your bachelor's degree, long enough with F3 to have my life changed in nearly every way. Just as you grow in school, I've grown with 4 years of F3. My fitness is better, my M is happier, my faith is stronger, my leadership skills tremendously improved.  
**Thank you Carpex HIMs** for pushing, encouraging, and supporting... by your examples and shared experiences YHC is not the same man as I was 4 years ago.
