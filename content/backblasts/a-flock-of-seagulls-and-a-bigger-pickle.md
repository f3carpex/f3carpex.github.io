When Yoga Mat invokes Flock of Seagulls and Monty Python in the pre-blast everyone knows that the actual workout will never live up.  But we're all here so let's give it a shot.

We have an FNG so a full disclaimer and mission statement are delivered.  The Pledge and we're off.

Warmup:

Mosey a while and end up in a well lit parking lot within sight of our friends at Crossfit:

- 7 GM IC
- 26 SSH IC
- 15 Merkins OMD
- Calf Stretch
- 15 Merkins OMD

Thang One:

Partner up and take turns with the following in a flapjack fashion:

- Round 1 - Bear Crawl and Crawl Bear / Low Slow Flutters
- Round 2 - Forward and Reverse Lunge Walk / LBCs
- Round 3 - Lateral Slide / Freddy Mercs

Thang Two:

Mosey back to the rock pile for a 1/1/2/2 Rock Dora.  Partner 1 does Curls, Tricep Extensions, Shoulder Press and Rows.  Partner 2 runs the largest pickle YHC could find that doesn't require a headlamp.     

A quick Mary and a solid 3 minute plank to finish off the day.
