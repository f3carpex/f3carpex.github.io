With the upcoming Haven House Rumble, YHC thought I should try to train at least a little bit for the dance around the squared circle. It was a great morning to show up with a loosely developed plan. Watching a few clips of The One and Only Tony Horton inspired some P90x style exercises.

**0545 Circle Up, Mission, Pledge, Disclaimer**

Warm-Up: a couple of fellowship mosey trips around the pickle with some invigorating butt kickers, high knees, and karaokes. Circle up for the usual with a couple of exercises guest-Q'd by Burt. Because the Q couldn't breathe after 40 in cadence SSH, including 20 Burt Jacks...low and slow.

**Thang1:** Boxing Sevens

- circle up on the bball court; boxing inspired jab/cross/uppercut/kneeup routine as first half of the seven
- star jumps on the other side of the pickle for the other half
- Turns out it is really easy to complete just one cycle of jab/cross/uppercut/kneeup, as duly noted by the grumbling PAX. So easy that Saban went rogue and just randomly started doing Merkins. Never to disappoint the Q jacked up the reps, added some Merkins and sprinkled in some rope skips. Heart rate up: check.
