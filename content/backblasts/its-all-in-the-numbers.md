Today I celebrate 56 trips around the sun. I was thinking about how some numbers have corresponded to important times in my life. For example, I was born in '65 and today I am 56; my high school jersey number was 39, and I moved to Raleigh in '93; I graduated from college in '89 and my daughters were born in '98; I was married in '96 and .... well, all the numbers don't work.

8 PAX showed up at Wolverine, 3 ruckers did their thing. Disclaimer, Mission, Core Principle, and Pledge. Hi-Lighter (rucking) ensured penalty burpees were done because there was no shovel flag.

    \- It was a pleasure to led this morning. F3 has made the last almost 2 years very rewarding; I have grown emotionally, physically, and spiritually because of your support and encouragement.  
    \- I shared a story of how much of a bada$$ my mom is. My parents were farming in Central Wisconsin when I was born. On that evening, my dad was helping a neighbor butcher a cow that had been hit by a car, couldn't let it go to waste. My mom stayed and milked the cows by herself, 9 months pregnant with me, with my 3 year old brother and 2 year old sister in the house. She is tough and also incredibly humble. She did not tell me this story until I was in my late 30's or early 40's. The stress that I placed on her when I was growing up, she certainly could have used this as leverage.
