Ever since I attended my first themed workout, I knew that is the way I wanted to go when I started Q'ing. I believe it was a Hello Kitty Q themed on the college football playoffs, nothing fancy, but it was never the less, inspirational.  However, a time comes in every man's life where he has to embrace change and also that time was Sunday night where he hasn't come up with a theme and needs to go to bed, hence my first vanilla Q.  ps....next Q on 11/1 for my anniversary will be themed (think nihilists, mistaken idenity, and rugs).

26 of us got started early on a Monday morning in the gloomiest of glooms with the pledge, on to a quick warm-up run to the neighborhood pool parking lot where we circled up for warm ups:

- 16ish in cadence Side Straddle Hops
- 20 on my down Merkins
- 5 in cadence Good Mornings (nice and slow!!!!)
- 10 Lunge Twist things (this group was unimpressed)

Thang 1:

- Jog down to the bottom of the hill at the start of the greenway
- 11s with Star Jumps at the top and Wolverines at the bottom (ascending wolverines are brutal)

Thang 2:

- Back to the park and to the small field where we grab a rock
- **Rock B.L.I.M.PS**
    - 10 Rock Burpees (hold rock do merkin with hands on rock, jump up and overhead press) then sprint across field and mosey back
    - 10 Rock Lunges (lunge and overhead press) then sprint across field and mosey back
    - 10 Rock Imperial Walkers (Rock down to each knee, then overhead press) then sprint across field and mosey back
    - 20 Rock Merkins then sprint across field and mosey back
    - 10 Rock Prisoner Squates then sprint across field and mosey back

Get to the parking lot and Bear Crawl back to the flag.  Circle up for some Pax lead Mary (Freddy Mercs, LBCs, Dying Cock-a-Roaches, Plank Jacks). End with a chatty have a nice day :(

Prayers for Burt's in-laws as they adjust to changing abilities as they age.  Praise for Jiggly Puff's 7 years of marriage.
