My normal routine prior to posting is to always see what Steve’s forecast would be. He has a lot of moisture planned in the gloom. So, when I hear that, I prepare myself mentally that I’ll be quite moist during the beatdown.

Term Paper sends a Slack post to Hello Kitty and me wanting to know how dry we will be. I replied, “we will be moist!”

0430, I do an EC walk with my dog and the weather was ok at the time ... Slight drizzle. As I leave for BH, it was pouring rain. It was not going to sway me at all. I love playing in the rain. It makes me feel like a kid again.

0530 and it is a blissful downpour. No FNG and Pledge of Allegiance done, we head out on a slow mosey to our starting point to warm-up.

Warm-up: GM, hamstring stretch, Abe Vigoda, Sir Fazio, air presses, seal claps, and behind the back claps.

Now that we are warmed up, it was time for the thang.

Thang: Split- Deck of Pain with mosey runs in between.

Clubs: Fluttering Supermans

Diamond: Steve Earl

Hearts: Burpees

Spades: Anvil

Aces: Ab exercise of pullers choice x15

Joker: Q favorite

We did several rounds but we did not turn over all the cards. What was amazing was the amount of Fluttering Superman’s we did ... moist cannot describe how drenched we were. We moseyed back to the flag for thang 2.

Thang 2: round of dips x25 IC, L/R step-ups x25, Irkins x15 IC, have a nice day.

GTL and Wonder Bread blended in with us in COT after their run.

CoR: 13

NoR: Respect (3), mehs (10)

P&P: prayers for Cataracts and Ausfarht. Prayers for Disco Duck’s M Kelly.

Playing in the rain makes you feel like a kid again. Fluttering Superman's was the exercise of the day.

I am extremely blessed to be out in the soaked gloom with my Brothers who are crazy as I am to be out there. What is most amazing is they wanted to be out in the rain. True HIMs!!!
