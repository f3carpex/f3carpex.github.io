## 11/12/19 Flirting with Disaster

It's Respect week. So it means YHC set aside his walker and came out to teach some whippersnappers what happens in the dark, wet, woods.

## Warm-ups

After a short run around the pickle, we circled up for some side straddle hops, good mornings, merkins and mountain climbers. Then it was time to run into the dark, dark woods.

We ran to the junction for some exercise I can no longer remember since I was out of breath at the time. Then it was off to the bridge. I'm glad I brought a light.

## Thang 1

Merkins on the near side. Bear crawl the bridge to the midpoint and lunge to the other side. Sevens on the ramp down the hill with squat jumps at the top and merkins at the bottom. Bear crawl and lunge back to the other side. After a way too short 10 count, off we ran to the cross roads. We did some exercise that I cannot remember because I was too busy trying to breathe! Then we ran to the parking lot for some rocks, or so they tell me. I'm pretty sure I was unconscious for the run.

## Thang 2

Grab an ego rock! 3 rounds of rows, curls, presses, and triceps extensions decreasing each round from 15 reps. Does anyone have some bandaids? These guys got cut!! Off we ran to the flag for some Mary. We wrapped up with some American Hammers and Have a nice day.
