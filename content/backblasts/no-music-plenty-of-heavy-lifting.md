YHC has been absent from posting due to family and travel.  So it was good to get back into the swing of things with my second Q.....much appreciated Frisco......

We were 16 strong HIMS this morning.  My apologies for not getting all 16  listed.  There were tech difficulties with the video on my phone and I was not able to get everyone accounted for....as some may have thought YHC is not perfect

Quick job around the pickle - Pledge at the Flag

**Warm up**

SSH x 15

Cotton Picker x10

**Thang 1**

Partner up with 1 KB for 200 total each exercise while one pax runs the pickle

Swings

Squats

Dying Cocroach

**Thang 2**

Mosey up to the shelter.  Select a spot on a picnic table......Partner up with 1 KB for each exercise while partner 2 completes 25 step ups.  Flap Jack till complete.

100 KB Curls 

100 KB Tri Extensions

50 KB Thrusters

All was going well with Thang 2 until Trike asked YHC why there was no music.  I suggested he sing.  When no singing commenced, YHC called an audible and added 50 more curls and 50 more extensions.  That settled the mumble chatter.
