The evening had a certain feel to it. The kind that would put you in the mood for a good workout! Mainly because it was a Tuesday night, and all know by now that thats Rush Hour time! 7 pax in total were there to get some sweat on (Captain Kirk would end up joining us for COT).

So after the Pledge of Allegiance we were off and running. Disco Duck and WWW did some Bruiser walking.

_**Warm Up:**_

We stopped at the garage along Academy St. for:

**Good Morning**

**SSH**

**Overhead Clap**

**Plank Jacks**

**Merkins**

**Calf Stretches**

_**Thang 1:**_

At the big fountain on the corner we partnered up for an almost classic Dora.

**100 Dirkins**

**200 Squats**

**300 LBCs**

The pickle was around the fountain

_**Thang 2:**_

After that we circled the restaurant we knew Shut In and his M would be dining at. Didn’t see him so we moved on and started heading back.

On the way back to the start, stop at each lightpole and do 1 **Burpee.**

_**Thang 3:**_

Pax plank in a line. 1 does 10 **Pullups** while the rest stay in plank position. Move down the line till everyone has had some fun with the **Pullups.**

_**Mary**_

We went around the circle and everyone called their favorite Mary exercise:

**WWII**

**Peter Parkers**

**Freddy Mercs**

**Boat Canoes**

**100’s**

**COT**

**Announcements:**

Oct 24th – Odyssey

Nov 1st – Work day at TCP

**Prayers/Praises:**

Prayers for Disco Duck’s family. Mainly his MIL

YHC took us out!
