23 HIM strong in the very moist & gloomy Wolverine -- so much for the bright sunshine post time change. T-Claps for 2 FNGs coming out in the rain -- nice start!

We started with the pledge of allegiance at the flag.  Cross Davis to the west sidewalk & head up to the middle school - started the warm up in the front, but moved to the back to avoid the garbage truck...

## Warm Up

SSH

Good mornings

Cotton Pickers

Sir Fazio forward & back

Bear crawl to your right now that shoulders are loose

Standard Merkins

Mountain Climbers

 

## The Thang

Head down to the track & find a partner roughly the same speed -- start at the top of the curve.  Partners split up in different directions & meet up on the opposite side for 5 -Bropees.  Halfway there & on way back, stop for the following:

Standard Merkins

Start Jumps

Carolina Dry Docks

Finish each set with 5 more bropees.

Enough of that, let's head for the shelter at Wolverine - catch-me-if-you-can with your partner back -- alternating 7 Merkins/CDDs before catching your partner.  (thanks Banjo & Hi-Liter for picking up the 6!

At picnic tables -- (just a bit crowded):  rounds of dips/irkins/prisoner squats, then lots of Mary -- LBC's, Dying Cockroaches, American Hammers, Hi-Liter special side plank elbow-to-knee thing.

Time's up -- head back to the flag and circle up for:
