Jigglypuff popped his Co-Q cherry this morning when he teamed up with YHC to take on a 60 minute beatdown at Phoenix, Cary's only Saturday AO. A lucky 13 came out including 1 FNG - Wrench for what turned out to be over 3.4 miles of running and other hoopla.

### Warm Up

YHC's watch of nearly a year decided to stop working. We started 1 minute late due to this but off we went down to the Kiosk. At the kiosk the Pax noticed two other young fit gentlemen getting their own workout on. They were invited to join us but declined. It was then that the PAX noticed said pair sprinting up the hill we usually use for 11's at a high velocity. It's probably best that they did things on their own.

Circle Up for the following:  
The Windmill ICx15 (much slower than YHC's Q Juice wanted)  
Good Mornings ICX15  
SFAC IC 10F/B  
Overhead Claps ICx15  
Standard Merkin OMDx20  
Mountain Climbers ICx15

### Thang One

  
Jigglypuff led the PAX in a single Indian Run at a nice easy pace towards the back of the park, down a greenway, past several "workout stations" and finally to a set up high up monkey bars.

Here we did 7's. 1 Pullup and then jog back to where the greenway split for 6 burpees.  
After we finished we gathered at the monkey bars for one group burpee.  

### Thang Two

YHC then led a mosey stopping for the 6 doing IC Pickle Pounders and Squat holds. We ran all the way back around past the Kiosk to the rock pile near the lake.

There we partnered up for Dora 1, 2, 3. One rock per partner.  
Partner 1 ran to the top of the stairs over looking the lake.  
Partner 2 started with 100 overhead rock presses, 200 rut rows, and 300 squats with the rock.  
  
When the teams finished we took a long mosey back to the flag for Mary.

### Mary

Homer to Marge
