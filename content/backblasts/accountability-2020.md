The new year brings new goals. YHC has not been very good at stepping up to Q as often as I should. So, what do you do about it? You get an accountability partner and make a pack. So, for 2020, YHC and my accountability partner @Deuce will hold each other accountable to Q at least once a month. In that vain, January kicks off the accountability pack with a Co-Q at Dazed and Confused. Good times were had.....  
  
No FNGs....Allegiance was pledged....Off we go.....  
  
YHC leads the PAX on roughly a quarter mile jog to get the blood moving.  
@Deuce leads the PAX through a series of warmups.
