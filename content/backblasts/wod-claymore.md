PAX: Chipper, EarharT, Frisco, Kwik Stop, Pickles, Press On, Tang, WWW

As I was trying to decide what workout routine to create, I went to my favorite place to research ... the good old exicon. I wanted exercises to push the limits for a solid WOD.

As 0545 hit, I was anxious to get rolling. F3 mission, core principles, and credo recited and our Pledge of Allegiance to Old Glory it was time to get down to business.

YHC/QIC led the PAX on a short mosey around the pickle to our starting point to warm-up.

Warm-up: GM into a hamstring stretch (l/c/r) into a runner stretch (l/r) with a Warrior Pose to a plank position to stretch out the calves and back to GM starting point. End the warm-up with Sir Fazio and seal claps. Next QIC calls out the thang.

Thang 1: WOD CLAYMORE with mosey around the pickle after each exercise is done.

Announcements: TCP Sawgrass, F3 Nation 10-year

6th Man: Tang who reintroduce himself and provide a testimony on why he continues to accelerate with F3.

NMS:

To keep the PAX guessing on the exercises, the exicon is a great place to start.

It is always a blessing to be out in the gloom with strong and motivated HIMs.
