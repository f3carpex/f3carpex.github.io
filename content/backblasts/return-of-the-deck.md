The evening finally came for the grand reopening of Carpex’s original evening AO, and it felt so good to be back! 10.5 pax came out to get their beatdown on. (because two 2.0s=1.5… which kept us “under the 10” mark) ...ok fine it was 11 overall, but who’s counting? Either way, it was a big crowd for Rush Hour. And it was awesome to see! Ok, with that out of way, YHC started off with the mission statement and the Pledge of Allegiance. Then we were off and running to do some warm ups!

**Warm up:**

- Good Evening
- Sir Fasio (forward and backward)
- SSH
- Imperial Walkers
- Mtn. Climbers
- Calf Stretches

**The Thang – Parking Deck Ascension**

If you’re a regular post at RH this is probably not a surprise to you, as we go here quite often. YHC had routines lined up for every level of the parking deck, which also led to YHC getting a little carried away with some of the routine on said parking deck. Mainly in the transitions from one level to the next.

_**Level 1:**_

Indian Squat Holds: Line up single file in the Squat Hold position (2 rows), last guy in line sprints up to the front of the line and so on all the way to the other side of the level. Repeato, with the pax in line in plank hold, up the ramp to level 2.

_**Level 2:**_

7’s: 6 Shoulder Taps to 1 WWII. Karaoke half way up the next ramp, Indian Bear Crawl the rest of the way up to the next level.

_**Level 3:**_

Partnered up for Dora: 100 Merkins, 200 Squats, and 300 Dying Cockroaches. Sprint up ramp to final level.

_**Level 4:**_

Calf Raises: 20 reps on one side of level, then mosey over to the other side for 20 more. Mosey back to the grassy area for some Mary.

**Mary**

- LBCs
- Homer to Marge
- Pickle Pounders
- Black Widow Knee Slides

**COT:**

5 Hate, 2 Meh, 4 Respect

**Prayers/Praises:**

For Term Paper’s recovery from shoulder surgery. For Cauliflower’s daughter’s recovery from surgery on her patella. Prayers for Build-A-Bear, and any and all other injured pax. Praises for my dad’s relief from high pain levels in his lower back.

YHC took us out!

**NMS:** Thanks again for coming out fellas, it was so awesome to see every one of y’all, and hope you all can make it out again soon! I’ve definitely missed this time! Oh and Earhart, I want to personally guarantee you the next time I Q here it will NOT involve the deck! ...Unless it rains, then we’ll see.
