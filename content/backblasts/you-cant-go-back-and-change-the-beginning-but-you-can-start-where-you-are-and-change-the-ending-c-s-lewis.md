It was cold, the fart sack temptation was real, and every day we are faced with decisions that will impact our end changes, but also change the story of those around us.

Maybe we speed up and block the car from merging in because they didn't wait their turn (zipper merge is scientifically proven to be more effective...another discussion for another time), we walk the cart back into the store, or when we ask somehow their day is going we actually stop and listen because we want to know and we didn't just ask because it is what you are supposed to do in the break room at work.
