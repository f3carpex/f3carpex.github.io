18 of Carpex's finest HIMs arrived in the finally crisp fall morning hours at North Cary Park for a Doogie VQ adventure.  Mumblechatter was at its finest with Burt in tow especially after I gave him free reign to speak his mind since he named me 4 months ago at Wolverine (spoiler alert).  Unfortunately for Burt he needed to be reigned back in only a few minutes later...

Thoughts:

Cool weather for once!

It has been an incredible joy to wake up and hit the ground running with you gentlemen.  I have grown physically and spiritually in the last 4 months.  I am grateful to F3 and to all of you.

The Wolverines were in honor of my first post to Wolverine and my first F3 injury which occurred when performing wolverines at Wolverine -- very Meta.
