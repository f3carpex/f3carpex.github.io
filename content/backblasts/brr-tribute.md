We held a planning meeting with Erkins, SSH and Squats. Never did come up with a suitable team name but split into 2 vans. Van1 ran the full soccer field track while Van2 did merkins, squats and LBCs. Flip flop for a total of 3 laps per van. StepUps, dips, pull ups, Derkins and jump squats were featured. Lastly we ran the staircase three times to help Ma Bell remember 9/11. Then we jumped on our bikes for some Freddie Mercâ€™s, followed by a Merkin ring of fire for time. The clock moved very slowly. COT and welcome FNG Tim, forever known as Body Parts to honor his career in medical device sales.
