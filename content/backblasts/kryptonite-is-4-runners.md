38 degrees. No wind. Clear. Nice morning at Koka Booth.

Biner and Burt offered to help out C Sopp when he reached out for a Sub. We cooked it up after mowing lawns yesterday for the Carying Place and agreed to jointly take his Q this am.

C Sopp made it after all with coffee and after running the TR 1/2...taboot. We thought it would be fun to surprise the men with a little switch....plus Burt wanted to get to 3 miles this week since catching some grief last week for not.

Everyone was waiting on C Sopp to lead when Burt calls a double apple sauce Indian run led by Biner and Burt your Co Q’s. We were so excited we left early and left Denali. Dang.

**Warm Up**

Double Apple Sauce to the big well lit lot. Circle up.

Biner: Happy Jacks (5 SSH and 1 Jump Squat), 4 x 4s (Merkins x 4 IC, Mountain Climbers x4 each leg) 4 sets, 10 penalty burpees for Danali being late...or not really late.

**Burt Thang**

Count off in 4s. 4 man Indian Run Group. Run to the next parking lot for some Indian Run 11’s. Merkins x1, long Indian Run in between then Hand Release Merkins x10.....and on and on until we audible and run back so we could finish up with Term Paper in the parking lot before his Monday scoot. We finished all but one final count of 11s as we hit the 3 mile mark.
