30+ Pax found a way to get to Bond Park Senior Center today between the hours of 0430 and 0545.

Some arrived that early for #TheMaynard, others a little later for #Insomnia, and picking up the 6 were those ready for a #Beatdown or a #Vesper run.

For those that couldn't make it a new(ish) F3 Lexicon word was discovered by YHC during a recent 43Feet podcast.  Some guys faced certain **circum**stances; work, family, scheduling, issues and had to fart**sack**.

Thus, the _**Circumsack**_.

Those that made it and joined in on the Bootcamp for YHC's bday Q were met with this challenge today:

**WARMUP** Shut-In Signature Warm-Up...with 5 Burpees OYO mixed it as Liverpool confessed he didn't read backblasts.  #publicshaming

## The Thang

- **Lightpole Lap:**  Pax took a lap around the park stopping at each light pole for increasing **prisoner squats**.  Things get a little tight when you're on High House so we audibled to **Lunge Walk** the rest of the way.  Some pax followed instructions, some heard something else and reset their rep count.  All in all the group finished at light pole 26. \* YHC was the 6 all morning.  4.2 mile Insomnia kicked this old man's butt.  Trying to maintain the "don't Q it if you can't do it" motto but it was tough.
- **Grab a Rock / Wear Gloves:**  When Qing all week it's tough to find a mix of full body stuff so, well so you can make it through the whole week pretty much...  So this exercise stemmed from that.  It's definitely one YHC will repeat.
    
    2 Exercises where you do 1 Rep Exercise 1 2 Reps Exercise 2 3 Reps Exercise 1 4 Reps Exercise 2 ... and continue climing in rep count until Q thinks the Pax have had enough.  In this case YHC was the first to crumble.  Stupid Insomnia....  YHC got _very_ lightheaded around reps 8, 9, and 10 so it was ended. Our exercises were **Rock Your Bodies**  /  and **BTTW
    
    **
- To get back to the flag we stopped at the kiosk and split to two groups doing a few sprints and merkin sets.  Then a final Billy Run where YHC unintentionally landed quite the GroupMe comment.  Can't print it here...

**COT / Announcements**

Prayers for Liverpools family tonight, for those on the IR, for Baby Callahan hopefully getting the best birthday date ever (today).
