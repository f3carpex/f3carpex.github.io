ShutIn let me know that he had to abandon his Q last night.  
I was prepared with a great beatdown and even pre-blasted a last minute Q change to get PAX interested.  
But when Yogi arrived, storming in from his EC run, he enthusiastically (is Yogi ever anything except enthusiastic?) asked to take over the Q. We hadn't seen him at Tortoises in a couple of months and he was more than excited to lead us.  
He talked me out of Q-ing. I had nothing much to say to keep the Q.  
I asked if I could play music, and, armed with a wordless soundtrack, the title of this backblast was decided.

Mozy to the light at the lower end of the lot, circle up and Yogi pulled out  
**The Deck of Pain**  
Hearts = Burpees  
Spades = Squats  
Diamonds = WW2s   
Clubs = Merkins  
...with Ace = 14   
  
We went around the circle, each pulling a card and calling down or up as appropriate. Some newish PAX called numbers instead of down/up. Note to them: check slack for the upcoming Q School.  
  
When it got to Frisco he quickly flipped over his card and said he had Ace of Hearts, so 14 burpees were called. Strangely, a little later someone \*really\* pulled up the Ace of Hearts. Seems Frisco didn't want to trouble us with a measly 2 burpees for the 2 of Hearts that he actually pulled.  
  
Variations in merkins were appreciated, with Eziekiel and Yogi selecting diamond merkins and Lawn Dart with wide merkins.  
  
We got through the entire deck + 2 cards in 40 minutes. Only one 10 count was called when we got back-to-back 10+ burpees.

PAX called favorites with 10 count.  
I called **Plankful**: plank hold around the circle but instead of 10-count, say something that you are grateful for. Plank + Thankful = Plankful. I thought I might call merkins if there were repeats - if a HIM said the same thing as someone else, but that didn't pan out. Feel free to adopt & modify as you will.

As always, it is a much better day when it starts with HIMs of F3. Thank you all for the encouragement and opportunity to share. Also, read TheMuggo.com. "Tired But Never More Awake" is how I feel everyday after F3.
