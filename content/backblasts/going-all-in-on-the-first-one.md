YHC got there early for a quick EC Ruck, and saw 16 Steves taking off on the Maynard.

Got back in time to see Pax rolling in, haven't seen some of these guys since before the lockdowns and closings, so was great to be back in the Gloom with these HIMs, who make themselves better and bring everyone around them up!

0630- Pledge to the flag, Skipper goes off to bring his own pain with the ruck, and the group moseys to the community center for warmups.

5- GM

10- Lowcountry inspired Crab Pickers

10- Sir Fazzio Arm Circles forward, 10 reverse

Thang 1:

Grab a non-travelling rock. Billy Madison inspired work

10 Squats, run to the street.

10 Squats, 10 Merkins, run

10 Squats, 10 Merkins, 10 American Hammers, Run

10 Squats, 10 Merkins, 10 AH, 10 shoulder taps, run

10 Squats, 10 Merkins, 10 AH, 10 shoulder taps, 10 rock-yo-bodys run.

Place rocks exactly back where they were, and mosey to the kiosk.

Mini-Thang - Pax hold plank. 10 Merkins around the circle, after your 10, hold the plank and the next pax does his 10. 18 Pax makes for a lot of planking.

Thang 2- 11s on the hill, choose your own adventure. Burpees on the bottom, squats on top. Run, lunge, or bear crawl the sidewalk up and down the hill.

Mary - Pax choice. Some flutter kicks, 100s, AH, WW2s, Protractors and some straight BS unnamed Mary that Yogi decided to call that brought the MC (Ollie loved them so much he named it the Straight BS)

Announcements:

10th Anniversary coming. January 15-17 Cape Fear.

PR/P:

COVID-19, those effected, first responders.

Term Paper, Cataracts and BAB getting back after it

NMS:

I haven't posted in a while, so getting back out with 19 of the greatest guys I could ever meet, the push to better myself and those around me was missed.

Horatio sandbagged how hard this was going to be, he brought it solid!

Skipper is a glutton for punishment, sounded like he did a stupid amount of flutter kicks OYO.

Yogi offering up coffeeteria at his home was inspiring!

Dang it's good to have F3 in my life.
