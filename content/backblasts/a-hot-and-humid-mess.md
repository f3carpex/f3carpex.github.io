# A Shelter Workout!

When it rains on the Hell’s Bell’s, the workout moves into the shelter (who wants to swing around a wet kettlebell).  And man was it hot and humid, even at oh-dark-30.  Katniss coming in hot, guess he didn’t pay the toll.  We head out and down to our favorite circle for:

## Warm Up

Good mornings

Cotton Pickers

Sir Fazio Arm Thingies

Overhead Claps

## The Thang

Done with the warm-up, we head back to the shelter where we had previously dropped the kettlebells to begin the impact workout.  Q takes the two 45lb weights and puts them on the sidewalk, then announces a different workout per station for each us.  One of the HIM is going to farmer carry the two weights down to the first tennis courts and back while the rest of the HIM perform the first round (all done OYO):

Kettlebell swings

Curls

Around the World

Goblet Squats

Tri-cep Extensions

Overhead Presses

We rotate positions and exercises once the farmer carry returns until all HIM have been to each station.  We then mosey to around the tennis courts and playground for a break and start in on the next round of farmer carry and the following exercises:

Kettlebell swings

Tick-tocks

Curls

Halos

Nut cracker squats

Dips and dirkins mixed in for fun

One more time through the exercises and farmer’s carry including:

Kettlebell swings

Lawn Mowers

Curls

Halos

Goblet squats

Once all the group has visited each pain station, we grab a kettlebell and mosey once out to the flag for:

## Mary

Mary with a kettlebell is a little different as you are generally holding the bell during the workout.  Mary included:

WW1 sit-ups on the up

Freddie Mercuries in cadence

American Hammers in cadence

LBCs in cadence

 

Bell tolls 6:15 and time to finish.

## COT
