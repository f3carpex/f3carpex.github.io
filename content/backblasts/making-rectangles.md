Really beautiful, crisp & cool morning at BnB! Here's what happened:

Welcome & mission, no FNG, pledge. Mosey to the big office building for warm-up -- typical stuff. Then, the big Thang -- 21's merkins & monkey humpers working the big parking lot making beautiful Strava rectangles -- added LBC's on the alternate corners.... After that we got a little bear crawling in as promised & it was back to the flag for CoT -- parking lot was packed with Lifetime Fitness folks crowding our space -- what the heck people??

CoT -- heavy respect day in the dirty dozen

Announcements: Sunday is Mother's Day -- don't be that guy. Speaking of that, 2 pm Sunday -- Carying Place mowing/cleanup help needed. Memorial Day Murph at HFT, Saturday -- Phoenix Spartan 300

P/P: upcoming graduates, kid's coming home from school, daughter getting work, silent prayers

NMS -- quick & dirty BB here, but it was a great morning -- 10/12 made it to NYB & we hung out quite a while -- good times!
