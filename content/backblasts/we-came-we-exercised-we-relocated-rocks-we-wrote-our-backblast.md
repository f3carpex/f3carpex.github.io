It was good to Q at ol' FOD this morning - had been a while.  A strong crowd of 28 gathered - including Kilmer in a Cabriolet (back in my day - only sorority girls drove those)..... hmmm.

Oh well - follow me - YHC said softly and started running up the parking lot through the dark path and up the road to the mailbox.

Once there, we circled up for GM x18, IW x 14, HB x 12, SF Arm Circles - 10 each way, 10 seal claps and 10 overhead claps.  We also did our count o' rama here - 28 brave HIM this am.

Next we bear crawled 1/2 way up one row of the parking lot and lunged the rest of the way.  Then - repeato back down.  Side shuffle up to next section of parking lot then form into teams of 4.

Time for some Dora 2,4,6 - with 200 merkins, 400 LBCs, 600 squats - with two from each team exercising and two having a fellowship run around the parking lot.

Next we painted some lines - and then YHC led us off road onto the grass path in the woods - the mumble chatter was definitely loud at this point.  We arrived at the back side of the hidden rock pile and each pax grabbed a rock and headed on down the gravel path to the road.  We walked on with rocks over head until we reached the first lamp post.

From here - we ran 2 lamp posts, put rocks down, ran back one post and returned to rock where we did 10 curls - repeat - continuing 2 lamp posts each time and alternating with overhead press and tricep extensions.

Once we arrived at the old rock pile - we did some rock rows for good measure and then deposited 28 fresh rocks into the standard FOD rock pile.  Rock relocation complete.

(Sidebar - when we emerged from the woods with our rocks, Badlands and mistakenly grabbed a pebble so he was sent back for a real rock).  Banjo thought that Hermes had the same problem so he swapped his rock out as well.

Nearing the end of time we went to the bball court for a quick suicide and 2 quick sprints.  Then circle up for WW2 x 15 at which point it was precisely 6:32 ish.
