YHC called a pre-BRR hill day with four laps up the big hill along Cary Parkway (0.8 mi round trip). A few HIM's arrived early for the EC, then we went right to it. Frying Pan joined us from Rock Hill, SC.

Quick warm up over by the CrossFit place, then off to the hill for the workout. Top exercises (one each lap): 30 LBC's; 30 Freddie Mercs (4 ct); 30 Dying Cockroaches; 30 Hello Dollies. Bottom exercises: 30 squats; 30 Diamond Merkins; 30 CDD's; 30 Wide-arm Merkins Build-a-Bear and Wonderbread led the charge, tallying about 4 sweat-soaked miles - not bad for a Tuesday!

We circled up for a quick mini-Mary, praises and prayers. Thank you gentlemen for allowing me to lead today. See you in the Gloom!
