It was several weeks ago at Full Metal Jacket when some Q (I'll just say Hi Liter or Riptide to cover my bets) called 7's and in a very respectful and diplomatic way, Callahan screamed out from the PAX that we're doing them wrong. He continued that 7's were not just shorter versions of 11. He then grabbed his ball and went home.

Being a good person, I wanted to make sure he was ok so I reached out to him and asked him what he meant and how could I make things right. He asked me how I got his number and told me to look up "Stairway to Seven" on the Exicon and then hung up the phone.

The rest is soon to be Bradford's Ordinary History.

0540 EC runners come strolling in, and the rest of the PAX gather at the flag. 0545 Off we go. 0546 Callahan shows up.

Mosey to the bottom of the parking lot, paint the lines with a little side step shuffle, then circle up.

**Warm Up:** Good Mornings; Windmill; Arm Circles; Seal Clap; Overhead Clap; SSH: Steve Earle; Mnt Climber; Merkin

Mosey over to a side road not often taken with a nice little incline. Quadraphilia: Run forward down the hill, backwards up. Repeato

Mosey over to S. Academy for some Go Gos to the Arts Center

**The Thang** Stairway to Seven Eleven: 1 Burpee at the bottom of the stairs. On the first step 1 Sumo Squat. Run to top of stairs 1 Scorpion CDD. Run down ramp to the bottom of the stairs. Repeat adding 1 rep to each exercise and going to the next step until you've completed all 11 steps for a total of 66 burpees, sumo squats and scorpions.

Mosey back to the road less traveled and repeat 2 sets of Quadraphilia.

Mosey to the flag

**Mary**: Boat/Canoe; Liverpool led Protractors; 100s; Have a good day (variation of have a nice day)

**COT** Lots of announcements with varying degree of information. - 11/17 Ruck, F3, Fia, F3 Dads - 11/17 Charity 5k (see Coxswain for details) - The annual "Forget Your Family and Hang Out With F3 Guys All Day" event is coming up. See Slack or Hello Kitty for details. - December clown car to JoCo. Frisco has no more details than that. - Ma Bell is selling wreaths. Liverpool's wife says they're a good bargain.

I know I'm missing something so pay attention to Slack.

YHS took us out with excerpts of Robert Frost's "The Road Not Taken" but here's the entire poem

> Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth;
> 
> Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same,
> 
> And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.
> 
> I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€” I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.
