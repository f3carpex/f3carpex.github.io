Afternoon PAX!

It is hard to believe in less then a week we will be writing 2019 on checks…if you know anyone that still writes checks! What else does that mean is about to happen? The **2019 CARPEX New Year’s Day Convergence!!**

This is the event HIMs throughout the Nation have been preparing for all year and YHC can assure you it will not disappoint. Below are the plans for the epic event along with what you can do to get ready.

- AO Location: Field of Dream - Thomas Brooks Park, 9008 Green Level Church Road, Cary, NC 27519 by the lower parking lots
- When
    - 6AM – EC Pre-run with Banjo and team
    - 7AM – Boot Camp of all Boot Camps with a special offering from Build-A-Bear, Disco Duck and YHC
    - 8AM – Quality 2nd F with food and drink

So how can you help? At previous CARPEX convergence events we have seen 50-70 PAX join in and make the event a huge success. For this convergence to reach that same level of excellence you can do 2 things:

- Bring an FNG with you. No matter their overall condition or current condition because of the previous night’s liberties. A solid workout is the best way to work all those indiscretions out.
- Bring food or drink to share. Anything from a bakery item at the local store from a homemade family secret recipe that will change our view of food as we know it. Bring a liquid to share, water, Gatorade, hair of the dog, it is totally up to each person. You don’t have to bring enough for each person but bring some to share and we should end up with more than enough. If my memories are correct, a griddle even showed up last time to make fresh bacon so whatever is your thing…
