### **Like the first day of school, YHC set out clothes, made sure the flag was ready and playlist was primed for the soft launch of HOT FOR THE TEACHER. During my first Q (Hell’s Bells) in October 2018, I created a kick-ass playlist that included everybody’s favorite “Hot for The Teacher” by Van Halen.** At one point @discoduck leaned over and said “ This would make a great name for an AO” When we scouted the new Thursday site and first decided on a starting point in the Publix parking lot, HFT was not one of the choices. After the decision was made to plant the flag at Olive Chapel Elementary well... we had no choice.

### YHC lead the Pax with the Pledge with disclaimer and “Running with the Devil” helped us move across Olive Chapel Rd to the Publix parking light complete with stadium lighting. The first warm-up movement was for @red Ryder The Monkey Humper. Side Staddle Hop Burpees were magical in sync sort of with Hot For Teacher!

### **YHC lead the pax from Publix to Kelly Rd Park where the fun began.**

### **THANG 1 created by Theisman is the Coach. Partner 1 does one PU P2 Sprints the pickle and P3 Coaches P1. We did one round for now.**

### THANG 2 brought us to the hilltop of Kelly Park’s Greenway. We did 7’s on the hill. David Lee Roth Diamond Burpees at the top and Bobby Hurley’s at the bottom. “Jump” was played and most of the pax worked on their best DLR scissor kicks.

### **Running out of time with some travel time built in, @Theisman requested another round of “Coach”. This allowed YHC to save something for the 7/4 Convergence. One more round of “Coach” and we headed back to the flag. About 2.5 miles were covered in all.**

### **MARY: We started with Morning Wood AKA the stiff arm TGU 5 on each included groans and grumbling. Homer to Marge American Hammers LBC and Control Freak Merck’s**

### **Announcements: HFT Hard Launch 7/11 @Slappy (Site Q) has the lead. July 4th Convergence @ Bond Park 7:04 Start time @Red Ryder @qwerty and YHC have the Q. It will be a beat down for the ages. Bring a pen to sign the Declaration at the end. Spoiler alert... we win. Crazy Night Train coming soon.**

### **Prayers and Praises: Earhart thanks everyone for all the support and encouragement during his absence and we are happy to see him back. Please keep Kelly and Duck in your prayers as they mourn the loss of her Dad. @WWW had some kind words for YHC and I am truly grateful for the EH he put me in a year ago.**

### **YHC closed it out with a prayer asking GOD to lift prayers to our brothers and bless this site. May we get stronger.**

### **THE PLAYLIST: Running with the Devil / Hot For Teacher/ Panama/ You Really Got Me/ Right Now/ Jump/ Mean Street/ Dance the Night Away/ Purple Haze**
