If YHC has one skill when it comes to Qing. One that is greater than all the rest. It has got to be the ability to sign up to Q the morning after late night events.

Thursday night football...a major holiday...Christmas Party...you name it, I'm probably Qing it.

So of course YHC has the Q on Friday at Slippery When Wet when just hours ago he was stuffing his face with pasta, slingin a few back, and toasting to the new year. With no plan on the drive in YHC started pulling some pieces together while en route. Deck of Cards is about all I could come up with over the 12 min span...#ProTip: leave a deck of cards in your car. It's an easy out as a Q and doesn't take up a lot of space..

Let's see what I remember...

- A botched disclaimer, unmotivated Q (and some pax), and we're off! Running to the Odyssey warmup parking lot.
- We picked up the six and did our warm up
- We ran around the corner of the lot and spread out down the parking lot
- YHC explained the rules, "I call an exercise, pull a card, we do that many reps, run across the lot, do 1 less rep, run back do one less rep, etc.
- Example: CDDs, 5 of hearts = 5 CDDs, sprint, 4 CDDs, sprint, 3 CDDs, sprint, 2, 1...you get it.
- We did these and probably some more I can't remember:
    - CDDs
    - Knee Tucks
    - Sprints
    - Death Squats
    - Merkins
    - WWIIs
    - Bear Crawls
    - Star Jumps
    - maybe a couple more...my mind was barely functioning so my memory will not hold up.
- Then we ran out of there to Kildaire, held for the 6.
- Next pax ran down to the stop light and ran back to the 6. Upon their return they did 25 merkins then followed the 6.
- At the light we repeated to the park entrance. Upon returning to the 6 we did 25 squats
- After a few mary exercises time was up.

See you the day after Christmas probably...............
