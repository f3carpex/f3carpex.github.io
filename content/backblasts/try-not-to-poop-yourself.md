As #RespectWeek winds down, there was one last Friday flurry of RESPECT Qs before the finale tomorrow at Phoenix. YHC had actually signed up for this Q before the concept began, so it was fate. And I knew I had to bring it, when I saw 22 pairs of eager eyes staring at me from the gloom - well, 21, 'cause Freebird came in on 2 wheels as we were saying the Pledge of Allegiance. The 22 included 2 FNGs to which the disclaimer had been given. 0545 - off we go to the end of the parking lot at the circle by the maintenance shack for

**The Thang**

Mosey over to the path by the road at the bottom of the hill. Line up in waves and _sprint_ to the top. At the top, do 6 hand release Burpees. Squat hold when you're done. Jog back to the bottom, line up in waves, and sprint to the top. At the top, do 6Â  x 180 Burpees. Squat it out til the PAX finished, then jog it on over to the main entrance and partner up for the main event.

DORA 1-2-3: As a pair, do 100 Merkins, 200 LBCs, and 300 Squats. While one partner is doing exercises, the other will run down to the basketball court, do one full suicide and run back up, then flapjack. Repeato until all exercises are complete. Plank-a-rama while all partner pairs finish up

Jog down past the playground, across the wooden bridge and down the path to the pond, next to which is quite possibly the best rock pile in all of CarPEX. Grab ya a rock and gather up for:

- 15 x Rock Rows IC

Put your rocks back and jog back up toward the flag with a lunge walk across aforementioned wooden bridge and a sprint up the last hill to the flag and circle up for

**NMS**

- The origin of the backblast title started after the first sprint up the hill. One of the PAX noted that his goal was to try not to poop himself. The BB just wrote itself after that comment
- Mumblechatter was pretty strong during the first 25 or so SSHs. After that, it started to wane. After the first sprint up the hill, it was nonexistent (except for the poop comment).
- Thank you to all the PAX this week who allowed us RESPECTs to lead you. Thanks for following and for keeping us old folks young at heart. As always when YHC Qs, it was my honor.
