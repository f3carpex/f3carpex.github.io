After yesterday's chest and shoulder Kitty Kluster at Sippery When Wet, YHC decided it to be leg and abs morning. With the Brave and Mighty Oliie posting for a solo 5-mile EC, the remaining 23 less motivated PAX assembled for the pledge and headed out on a mosey across High House for a warm up. Let it be noted that Pet Sounds posted, fresh from RDU and red-eye from Cali!

**Warm Up** Side Straddle Hops, Good Morning, Hillbilly's, Plank Jacks, Mountain Climbers

**Thang 1** Dora 1-2-3: 100 V-Ups, 200 Side Plank Crunches, 300 Freddie Mercs in 4-count; run the pickle with 10 squats half way each lap. Liverpool led an advanced course in high volume mumblechatter to entertain us all.

**Thang 2** 11's on the Big Hill: After a nice warm-up Dora, mosey back across High House, down the big hill to Jersey Mikes lot for a set of admittedly ambitious 11's - Star Jumps at the bottom, Monkey Humpers on 4-count at the top (modified by most and by Q on lap 4 to a single count for timekeeping purposes). We made it to 7 or 8 laps (it's about 0.3 mi round trip), stop and recover at the top with 5 mins to go. Plank hold for the six.

Partner carry top of the hill back to the flag for a quick LBC and Have a Nice Day Mary

**COT**  
Welcome FNG Bailout! Praises from visiting Double D for all the college grads (his is graduating Duke this weekend) and from Liverpool, as echoed by Kitty, for what F3 has brought to his family and family life. Prayers for our brothers Ausfarht and McCants.

Thank you men for the honor of leading you today. Next time we will be faster, better, stronger, and we'll finish all 11's on the Big Hill. SYITG
