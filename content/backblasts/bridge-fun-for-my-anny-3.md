I have an easy F3 anniversary date to remember -- May the 4th be with you! Thanks to my man, Flacco for bringing me out! Speaking of Flacco, he's doing the Murph-A-Day in May -- wondering if I may be able to help him out.... Anyway, he's what happened at FWD this fine morning:

Gather at the flag, have everyone pair up with a Get Better Buddy -- accountability partner for the day, Flacco brought us Star Wars props so we were instructed to pass along the lightsaber during the workout, jog to the pickle for a quick warm up -- set of good mornings, then we are off to the rock pile. Everyone picks up 10 rocks and we run the greenway to the bridge. On the near side of the bridge partner #1 puts his 10 rocks in a place he will remember and we go across to the other side where partner #2 puts his down as well. Long set-up for the thang:

Bridge Fun! Partner 1 leads partner 2 for 10 merkins then run to the middle of the bridge for 5 pull-ups, then to the end of the bridge for 15 squats, then removes one rock leaving 9. Partner 2 does the same bringing the GBB's back across the bridge. Back & forth we go until all the rocks are removed -- 20X if you are counting at home. We picked up the 6 & ran back to the flag.

2+ miles covered, 100 pull-ups, 200 merkins, & 300 squats -- maybe we should have a name for such a workout??

CoT: 12 pax, 2 respect, 10 meh

Announcements: Saturday at Phoenix -- Spartan 300 -- be there!, Memorial Day Murph at HFT

P/P: Callahan's son for allergy testing, friend of Flacco facing a cancer diagnosis & treatment battle

NMS: I love you F3 men! Thanks again for Flacco for introducing me -- my best days start in the gloom with y'all and I'm a better man for being part of this great group! Let's keep getting better everyday and be a light of energy to our families and beyond! May the 4th be with you!
