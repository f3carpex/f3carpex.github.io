12 HIM's posted on a chilly January morning for what YHC announced would be a Murph. Well, it turned out kinda that way, with legendary mumblechatter. Joe Smith - you shoulda bought a Maytag.

EC departed 0510 on schedule, route modified due to ice: YHC, Poolee, Wonderbread, Denali, Chanicleer, Joe Smith , Grease Monkey.

**Warm up:** Good Mornings, Windmills, Michael Phelps (in consideration of the Murph to come)

**The Murph:**

Mile 1: Mosey to the greenway, left on the trail, left on Kildaire, left back to the park.

Pull-ups, Merkins & Squats: Much mumblechatter about Joe Smith's new GE dishwasher (10/12 of the PAX own Maytags, some of which have apparently run continuously for 42 years). And apparently Grease Monkey is quite the Vitamixer, dispensing culinary advice (while suspended from a pull-up bar) about the virtues of Sorbet (making it ahead - it freezes!). Q called a recover with 12 minutes remaining, granting waivers to the PAX who modified or didn't finish (brother Grease, not among the slackers...)

Mile 2: Repeato

**Mary, COT:** LBC's, Low Slow Flutters (holding this position caused much whining amongst the PAX), Box Cutters, Have a Nice Day

Prayers for Oofta's M; Staubauch took us out.

Coffee with Joe Smith followed.

Thank you men for allowing me to lead you today. SYITG
