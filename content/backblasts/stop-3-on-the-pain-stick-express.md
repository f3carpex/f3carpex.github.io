So when Build-A-Bear messaged me on Monday to "ask" me to incorporate the pain sticks into my Q on Wednesday, of course I said yes. You've seen him right? So with my original workout put back on the shelf for another day, I started drawing up some new plans.

Big group this morning of Insomniacs, Vesperers and SNSers. The boot campers broke off and headed toward the community center to find the afore mentioned pain sticks waiting for them.

YHC took us out with a quote from author and professor Joseph Campbell

> "Where you stumble, there lies your treasure. The very cave you are afraid to enter turns out to be the source of what you are looking for. The damned thing in the cave, that was so dreaded, has become the center. However, if the path before you is clear, you're probably on someone else’s.”
