Upon checking the weather last night, I posed the 'more PAX than degrees Fahrenheit challenge' to the Twittersphere. This ended up being way closer a proposition than we thought it'd be! 25 > 22.

Pulled the main idea for this morning's Thang from a workout Squatter led at FWD last year. Knew that I wanted to 'climb a mountain' with the low temps, and his routine fit the bill.  
  
As I walked the course down ahead of the workout, I realized that yes, I had been inspired by Squatter, but Banjo's recent Phoenix course and routine was eerily similar - simply with less choice for the PAX this time. I potentially had enough time to change it up... but stuck to the plan any ways. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  
  
Way to watch out for each other and avoid injury out there, brothers. It was pretty treacherous out there.  
  
Special note: if you hit a rainy Rush Hour the night before a cold morning workout, dry out your dang gloves. I was making fists in the main part of the gloves by the end of the morning, and the fingers were legit frozen solid. But I digress, the Midwest had it ROUGH this morning. TAP in that direction.  
  
Thanks everyone!
