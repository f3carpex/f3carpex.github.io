YHC apparently forgot why Rush Hour got its name! Waze said 5:43 arrival and it was dead on.

Popped out the car and noticed a LOT of people waiting around for a Q. 19 to be exact. It was said that's a record, not sure the accuracy of that but YHC will take it!

Why so many guys!? 1. The weather, bro! It was gorgeous out there! 2. The beers that would soon follow. 3. Kids at swim practice. 4. Fartsackers. 5. Those that thought Disco Duck was Qing!?

Whatever got them out, YHC was glad to have the group we did. Everyone worked hard, got in a solid sweat, and many followed it up with fellowship afterwards.

Special shoutout to the Starsky crew: Liverpool, Franklin, Renaissance (BB run), Open Out (BB run), Road Rash, Spit Shine (in a suit). It's like it was its own AO!!

Here's what we did!

1745: Disclaimer / Pledge  
1750: Circle up in Pocketest of all Parks for a brief warmup: Good Afternoons, Hillbillies, Merkins.  
1755: Head to grass hill next to parking deck

**Thang 1**: Hill 7s with Alligator Merkins at the bottom (L/R = 1) and Big Boy Situps at the top. When you finish partner with a pax who hasn't and finish with them.

**Thang 2**: Partner 7s on the top deck of the parking garage. Get roasted while getting roasted! It was HOT!

- Partner up and meet in the middle. P1 runs to the right every time and does Aussie Mtn Climbers. P2 runs to the left every time and does prisoner squats. Meet up on your run back to the middle and do patty cake merkin burpees (1 burpee, then 2 burpees, etc for the 7s count.
- Now flapjack so P2 is doing aussies and P1 is doing prisoners. We kinda messed up the burpee count so YHC switched it to patty cake merkins for the 7s count instead of burpees.

**Thang 3**: Finish strong with a ladder at the pocket park. 1 dip, 1 aussie pull-up, bearcrawl the breezeway bridge, 1 vup. Next lap do 2 of each, etc. We got in 4 laps before we all passed out in COT.

Awesome job everyone, it was a pleasure to lead. I got a lot of positive feedback on this Q so I really appreciate it and it was great seeing everyone so ridiculously sweaty. GREAT WORK!

**Prayers**: Aristocrat's family, Frisco's family, those on IR, and anyone else I forgot.
