Workout date: 08/14/17

QIC: Fluoride

On the way to our warm up in front of Koko Booth, somewhere in the chatter I heard that Eddy Money had been playing at Koka Booth the night before. What a blast from the past, did not know he was still out there. I had another concert in mind as we began our workout, it involved not only music but lots of sweat and some pain. So we checked our "Two Tickets to Paradise" and headed lakeside for our warmup.

**Warmup**

Run to lakeside next to the Amphitheater

- Good Mornings x 15
- SSH x 15

Continue around the lake to the halfway point

- Mericans x 20
- Plank Jacks x 20
- Arm Circles x 20 each direction

Complete run around the lake back to the amphitheater.

**The Thang**

In planning this work out YHC realized that since its beginnings we have never done a workout inside of the actual amphitheater,  so today was the day we would break that trend. We assembled at center stage to get our marching orders. We couldn't work out in the amphitheater without music, so I pulled out the old mobile speaker to crank up a concert for the day. In honor of the upcoming Solar Eclipse our morning selections were from Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon.

Set of Elevens with:

- Burpees at center stage 1-10
- Derkins on the opposite deck 10-1

Balls to the Wall behind the stage with a 10 count around the circle.

Disengage the wall and run back to the flag to the tune of Money, classic Pink Floyd.

**Mary**

- Chinese Downhill led Low Slow Flutter x 20
- Burt led American Hammer x 10
- Grand Finale six inch leg holds with 10 counts around the circle.

**COT**

Had a great time putting this one together this morning and sharing it with the PAX. You guys are a blessing to me and it is a true honor to lead.

Hopefully this will be the beginning of a concert series at Koka Booth, and the concerts are free!!!!

You guys in CARPEX need to venture out some time and try a little Kryptonite on Monday mornings. That other work out in Apex is too crowded, and we finish early.
