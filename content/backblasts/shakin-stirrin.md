Warm & beautiful morning in Cary’s Bond Park for Shaken not Stirred – great group of hard workin’ men too!  It was my pleasure to lead such a group & I thoroughly enjoyed it!

No FNGs, only familiar faces.  Started with the pledge & moved out to a close-by parking lot.  The group was informed that this is F3 – modify as necessary!  We rolled into:

The Warm Up

Circle up for SSH, good mornings, windmills, cotton pickers, calf-stretch merkins, mountain climbers, etc.

Thang 1

Big crew so we sub-divided into 4 indian run lines to mosey to bottom of Bond Park Rd.  7’s were done sticking together in the run groups – Burpees at the bottom & scorpion CDD’s at the top.  

Thang 2

Mosey to the big shelter for 3 rounds of step ups, irkins, dips, & dirkins.  Mosey to the amphitheater for single file bear crawls out & sir fazio lunge walk back zig zagging from the top down to the stage.  Nice work gentlemen!

Head to the kiosk for some Mary – side plank star crunches

Thang 3

Back-to-back “all you got” sprints up the hill with mosey back down to get the heart rates up & back.  Do the second just a bit faster than the first!  Move on to main intersection for the classic SNS billy-run to the flag. 

Circle up for a bit more Mary – Tubeless let some boat-canoe, then LBC’s, & H-A-N-D.
