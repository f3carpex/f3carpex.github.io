Albert Reinhold Carmichael, for whom this Q was named, was an American football player whom “holds the distinction of scoring the first touchdown in American Football League history…”[\[1\]](#_ftn1)

12 men gathered in the gloom on Friday, Aug 20th at Dazed and Confused to pay tribute via two Al Carmichael-themed exercises. The group convened, heard the F3 mission and disclaimer, and recited the pledge.

  
**Warm up:**

Brief mosey, Good Mornings, Sir Fazzios, Reverse-Fazzios, Michael Phelps OYO, Imperial Walkers, and Side Straddle Hops.

**Thang 1: The Al Carmichael** (20 exercises, followed by 50-100 yard sprint, 20 exercises again, and sprint (or mosey) back the 50-100 years). Repeat 6 times with different exercises. We completed all six rounds with:

- ‘Mericans.
- LBCs.
- Squats.
- Star jumps.
- American Hammers.
- Carolina Dry Docks.

College Football Trivia Question #1: Which single-season college football team is regarded as the greatest team of all time? Heard lots of “Alabama”, “Ohio State”, and other misfits. **_Come on boys, I’m wearing their color and their logo is on my shorts_**_._ Then, the ever-studious Term Paper exclaimed, “The 1995 Nebraska Cornhuskers!” Ding ding ding.[\[2\]](#_ftn2) Time for the next round.

**Thang 2: Al Carmichael Returns**

With a partner running the pickle, tradeoff between:

- Balls to the Wall
- Squat Hold
- Aussie Mountain Climbers

Repeat once.

Here @Kitty and @simmons showed up for the fun. @Kitty surprised me with his impressive knowledge of the 1995 Huskers – Tom Osborne, Tommie Frazier, Lawrence Phillips. **_How does he know all this? Is he, too, a Nebraska fan?_** Nope. Alas, he’s a Gator fan.[\[3\]](#_ftn3)

College Football Trivia Question #2: What team has ever won a college football championship three consecutive times? More “Alabama”, “Ohio State”. Trick question – no team has ever won three consecutive college football championships (_the Huskers were robbed![**\[4\]**](#_ftn4)_)

**Thang 3, cause there was spare time:**

- Bear crawl width of parking lot and back
- Carioca width of parking lot and back
- Squat walk with of parking lot and back
- Fast feet (aka, the Butkus, because football) for 15 reps.

A brief, but sweet, sweet Mary, followed by 5 burpees (because.)

Count-a-rama, Name-a-rama, announcements and prayers concerns, and followed by a nice football prayer (recruited out loud, and shouting, by all men in the gloom):

**_Dear Lord, in the battles we go through life,_**

    **_We ask for a chance that's fair,_**

    **_A chance to equal our all our strife,_**

    **_A chance to do or dare,_**

    **_And if we win, let it be by the code,_**

    **_With faith and Honor held high,_**

    **_And if we lose, let us stand by the road,_**

    **_And cheer as the winners go by._**

    **_Day by Day, we get better and better!_**

    **_A team that can't be beat, WON'T BE BEAT!_**

AMEN.

Cheers to @dr.suess and @honeycomb. Big, good, life changing events headed their way soon!
