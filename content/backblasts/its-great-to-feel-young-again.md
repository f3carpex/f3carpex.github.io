It's Great to feel Young again

No FNGs, 12 men Indian run to community center for warm-up of some things that are routine.

Playground: Five rounds: 5 pullups, 10 merkins, 15 squats 4: Kiosk: American Hammers 5: 7:00 am, stop by start to pick up any stragglers \[Chappy\] Dying Cockroach 6: Highhouse Rd: LBCs 7: Main Gate: Flutter kicks 8. Playground: Five rounds: 5 pullups, 10 merkins, 15 squats 9. Kiosk: Hello Dolly 10: Billy Run Road was extremely busy with Easter Egg hunt traffic so line up on 6, back facing Community Center parking lot, YHC calls go, finish at the second trail entrance.

Announcements: no Refinery Wednesday, breaking of bread at SNS instead. May 6 convergence and picnic. Breakfast followed at FUMC with Fried Green Tomatoes talking Young Life. @F3Carpex donated $80. Nabisco, Pet Sounds + 2.0, and YHC attended

Prayer concerns: Ma Bell, M Sputnik, and

YHC took us out. Well done men. 2.9 miles piled up with lots of merkins. Wow, it's great to feel Young again.

NMS: In attempt to mix things up, YHC had the pax separate themselves into faster and slower runners, then partner with opposite speed. Few wanted to step forward to the faster side and YHC had to step in. The point was too mix people up.

Ma Bell was missed. Not sure how many merkins completed, but easily between 200 & 300

Everyone loves pull-ups

Bartman is a natural at covering leadership responsibilities

Earhart quite displeased with YHC placing him with the faster group.

Young Life Breakfast attended by Nabisco, Pets Sounds and 2.0, and Banjo: Fried Green Tomatoes had an excellent testimony, explaining his passion for discipleship and of of Young Life's missions to create strong relationships and to reach out to those youth furthest from wanting to receive God's word.

Extra Credit Ruck, Bartman, Banjo, and Q Ollie. With two pain sticks and one sand bag, mosey to Kiosk for warm up: wind mills, good am, little man jumping Jack's. Set of 11's; merkins at top of hill, squats at the bottom with midway break for Ruck rows, ruck overhead presses, triceps ext with ruck, and ruck curls. Return to pick up the pax.
