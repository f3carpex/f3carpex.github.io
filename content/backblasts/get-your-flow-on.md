Five stalwarts ignored the impending rain and the specter of a Bartman Q to post at A-Team. It always rains at A-Team.

YHC had visited the beach twice this weekend, [once for business](https://www.facebook.com/events/1696651733741496/?active_tab=discussion) and once for pleasure. On the second trip, I was thinking "man, I'm really looking forward to BroGa tomorrow." Then I remembered I had the Q. Well, if I couldnt't go to BroGa, maybe I could bring some BroGa to Carpex.

- Short jog, with slight detour, to batting cage parking lot.
- SSH, GM
- arm circles / overhead claps / arm circles / moroccan night clubs
- mountain climbers
- 6 minutes of stretchery, mostly focused on hip mobility and a little lower back. Short advertisement for BroGa at NCMA on Mondays at 0530: Light run / stretch / repeato. Give it a try some time.
- Run to basketball court rock pile, find an ego rock.
- Partner up: 100x curls, 200x 4-count flutter kicks w/rock overhead, 300x goblet squats. Partner runs the pickle.

That took longer than YHC thought, but everyone finished having run four times. Mosey back to front parking lot.

- Just one round of 6's in the lot, mercans x6 at each island.
- Mary it out - Freddie Merc's, CDD's, and American Hammer x40 to finish.
