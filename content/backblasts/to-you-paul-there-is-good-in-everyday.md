YHC took us out.

I have asked you men to pray for my high-school friend Paul in Louisville who lost his wife just over a month ago. The man is hurting: "

_"Hardest day ever to get out of bed. Why? Don’t know, just miss her so much. Don’t call and ask how I’m doing for I don’t have an answer to that question and have a lot to do today. I’ll be fine. Felt like reaching out to someone, but decided why bother. I have a hole in my life that will never be filled. I’m up and dressed and headed to work. I’ll keep going. Just thought maybe by admitting publicly today how sad I am it might make me feel better."_ and his daughter writes back; _"Mom always said, “every day may not be a good day but there’s good in every day.”_  

Go out and Make it a Great Day.
