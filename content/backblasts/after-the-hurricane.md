    **Prayers:** Those impacted my the hurricane, especially McCants. Disco's M having surgery. Unspoken.  
    **NMS:** It was a great group tonight. Lots of mumble chatter with Burt and the Captain, loved all of it. Excellent 2F provided by Press On. Nice way to end the workout. Learned: -Pro MS Caulk IS paintable; -new restaurant coming to Waverly: Chicken Salad Chick. High praise from Riptide and a place for the sandwich king Burt to visit; - WRAL weather is the best viewing, it may be accurate too...; - The Hurricanes are in the playoffs; and Press On must have a wide range of beverages in his fridge. Riptide "accidentally" broke his block setting it on the grass; hmmm...
