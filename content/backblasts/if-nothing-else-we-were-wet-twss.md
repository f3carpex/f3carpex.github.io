Mosey down the greenway to the hill Yoga Mat says all great FWD Qs stop at. Perform 10 L/R Jump Lunges, Backwards run up the hill, 10 L/R Jump Lunges, Mosey back down, 10 L/R Jump Lunges.

Mosey to bridge. Perform 1 pullup, merkin & CDD. Run to bottom of switchbacks. Perform 2 squats, LBCs & Supermans. Run back to the top to perform 3 pullups, merkins and CDD. Run to the bottom for 4 squats, LBCs & supermans. Continue this pattern performing ascending odd numbers on the bridge and even numbers at bottom of switchbacks until we get to 10. Recover. Then starting at the bottom with 10 begin descending back down. We ran out of time and finished up at 7 before heading back to the flag.

YHC took us out with a quote from Lao Tzu

> _“In dwelling, live close to the ground. In thinking, keep to the simple. In conflict, be fair and generous. In governing, don’t try to control. In work, do what you enjoy. In family life, be completely present.”_
