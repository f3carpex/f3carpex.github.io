We're all familiar with Burger King's long time moto "Have it your way". I don't know that I have ever personally exercised my right to have it my way with their burgers but the options is there I suppose. It's empowering to have options. There is ownership in the plan when those involved are given the option to choose what kind of experience they ultimately want. This fundamental idea was visited in this workout.

Several set their alarms extra early to get some EC. Snots ran circles around us while Parker, Sub and Hanson incorporated laps into their ECP. Rooney (thank you for the GNR), Shut-In, Frisco (almost FNG), and YHC stuck to the more traditional ECP. I think Red Ryder wanted to be out there but has been hitting it hard all week so elected for a few EW (Extra Winks).

Upon 0545, with no FNGs, we pledge our allegiance to the United States of America then mosied to the circle at the end of the road for the warm-up.

Warm-up- Side Straddle Hop, Merkins, Australian Snow Angels, Low Slow Flutter, J-Lo, Steve Earle and the Good Morning.

Thang 1 - Have it your way Indian Run. Two groups- A 9 min/mile pace group and 6 min/mile pace group. After some hemming and hawing each pax had chosen what kind of experience they wanted to have. The groups set out for the same destination but in different directions with the hope that all groups would arrive at the same time even though they were running at different speeds. I can take no credit for this but it worked! All three groups arrived at the exact same time.

Thang 2 - Sliding Tunnel of Love. 6 min group jumped up on the hand rails along the side walk forming a tunnel which each pax would then crawl through. The tunnel slowly works it's way down the handrail. 9 min group does dips and squats at the picnic tables. Flap Jack.

Thang 3 - 50/50/50. At the amphitheater we partner up for 50 Worlds Worse Dirkins, 50 Homer to Marge, 50 J-Lo. Partner 2 performs 7 Burpos on the amphitheater stage then flap jacks with partner 1.

Thang 4- All you got Pull-ups for one round. Great effort and great encouraging by the pax.

Form back into pace groups to back track to our warm-up location.

Mary - Pax Choice. Several HIMs were called on to include Trike, Parker, Sub, Disco Duck and Ashbury. Each came to the center and led the pax in their choice mary exercise.

COT- Count-a-rama, Name-a-rama, Announcements

Prayer- Ausfart is having his brace removed and soon will begin rigorous physical therapy to rebuild that leg.

We continue to remember Swag's M and her health.
