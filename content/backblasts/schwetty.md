There was a disturbing abundance of sleeves at the skate park this morning.

**Warm-Up** Mosey over to the Town of Apex parking lot and circle up for hillbillies, daisy pickers, arm circles, copperhead merkins, copperhead squats and burpees (one for each untanked pax).

**The Thang** Mosey over to parking lot behind the building with the stairs on the sides. 5 hand release merkins, 5 squats, 5 LBCs and trip up and down the stairs. Repeato with 10, 15 and 20.

20 dry docks, 20 squats, 20 Homer-to-Marge and a trip up and down the stairs. Repeato with 15, 10 and 5.

Mosey over to the soccer fields where we find Fenway. 10 Australian mountain climbers, run across the field, 10 burprees, run back. Repeato 9 down to 1.

**Mary** Circle up on the field for Mary, ending with Side Plank Star Crunches at the buzzer.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  15 **Name-a-rama**:  4 RESPECT, 9 meh, 2 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers lifted for our brother Free Bird, for Fenway's mother, for Spalding's grandmother. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**  Red Ryder rolled in late, probably on purpose fishing for more burpees. I wanted to give him what he was asking for, but we knocked some out during warm-up, and a bunch more at the soccer field, and letting Hi-Liter call Side Plank Star Crunches seemed like a worse punishment.

YHC added the long socks to the tank top in honor of Kwik Stop's anniversary week. I Pity The Fool joined me. Everybody else you owe Kwik some box jumps.

Holy cow was it schwetty out there today. By the time we got to the soccer field YHC was struggling to breathe. Might need to work on my hydration.

Love you guys!
