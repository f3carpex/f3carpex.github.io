YHC signed up over a week ago to Q Slippery When Wet and had my greatest Q to date, planned...then Thursday happened. A slight miscalculation on the cruiser bike sent me flying. A primarily upper body workout quickly transitioned to an all leg workout less than 15 hours from launch.

Moving on....H.D. Ritter Park was open for business, the ECers came in, we get started with the disclaimer (most of it, I think) because there is an FNG present, the pledge was pledged and 19 of us took off for some new parking lots (for me, at least) on Crescent Green Drive.

We circled for some warmups: Daisy Pickers, SSH and calf stretches.

The PAX split into two groups: Group 1 went to the far end of the parking lot and Group 2 gathered at the other end. On my go, Group 1 settled into the Al Gore while Group 2 lunge walked to them. Switch. Once Group 1 completed their lunge walk while Group 2 was Al Gore'n...we did it up again, only this time the Al Gore was tweaked to Twinkle Toes...an Al Gore while doing calf raises.

We ran over to another lot close by and did some sprinting....the PAX sprinted on a slight incline to the other end and began quick feet....first trip up was ten (left/right = 1) and did this seven times, ending with a 70 count of quick feet. Good times.

We headed back to the first parking lot for a quick ring of fire...all hold plank and one by one we do one merkin around the circle and then two and then three. The blood was pumping by this point. (Term Paper made the very welcomed comment that this FNG should not go home without at least a few merkins under his belt...RESPECT caliber comment)

We headed back to the flag for a few Mary...LBCs, WWIIs and American Hammer.

Announcements: Golf outing on October 5 benefiting Mabopane; TPC Sawgrass is on this Sunday...check out the 3rdF TCP Sawgrass channel to HC and get details.

Prayers/Praises: Prayers for a family Practice (FNG) knows who all have COVID except one of the 2.0s, prayers for a friend's wife expecting some medical test results today and all the unspoken prayers.

The workout was not what I intended, but we all ran around for 45 minutes and made ourselves better. WELCOME Practice!
