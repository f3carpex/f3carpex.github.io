So thankful for F3 and the chance to Q today, as men we need men to trust, lean on and be able to pray with. F3 has been a rock for me and can't thank everyone enough.

Warm up:

23 Merkins, Gibson you are always with me and I miss you like crazy.

10 Windmills

10 PlankJacks

15 LBC's straight from PlankJack position which created some mumble chatter from the young men in the PAX. Too high tech for me.

Rock Work:

Partner Rock, Standing back to back did some passing of the Rock, then partner 1 did curls while partner 2 did 2 laps weaving in and out of the circle stones, then triceps work followed by rows.

Bridge Work:

Partner 1 did Scorpion CDD's , partner 2 did a sprint to end of bridge and slow jog back, next was wide grip merkins with bear crawls. Last was prisoner squats wth sprints.

Slow jog back to Flag:

Low slow flutters
