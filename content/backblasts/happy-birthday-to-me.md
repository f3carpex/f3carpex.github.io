What a fantastic, cool, lovey morning.  And dark.  Good heavens Marla Dorrel Park is dark at 5:45 in the morning.  As it is so dark, 5:45 finds Chanticleer rolling in and undressing as we roll out of the park and up into the parking lot in front of Lowes Foods.  Also known as "The New Order Cross Fit's Front Yard".  Punks!

I had a birthday Sunday and I am now 51.  51 breaks down nicely into 3 x 17 and the theme is set!  Chanticleer catches up and we circle up for:

- 17 x SSH IC
- 17 x Good Mornings IC  -Hold It-
- 17 x Forward Arm Circles IC  -Hold It-
- 17 x Reverse Arm Circles IC
- 17 Merkins (more or less) On my down, hold for 10 count on the 5th down.
- 17 x Plank Jacks IC

**The Thang**

Suicides  (how could we not in a nice, lit, lined parking lot)

Run to the first line and back - 17 burpies.  Run to the second line and back - 12 burpies. Run to the third line and back - 7 burpies. Run to the next line and back - 2 burpies.  Once finished, squat it out and wait for the 6.

Repeat and substitute Merkins for burpies.

Repeat again and substitute LBCs for Merkins.

**Next**

Line up two lines and take a lap around the parking lot.  Last guy in line does 10 merkins and sprints to the front of the line.  Last guy in line stops, drops for 10 merkins.  We do one lap like this.  Hat tip to Hermes and Hi-Liter who dropped and did 10 more merkins at the end of the run.

**Next**

Run back to the park and pick up a rock.

- 17 x Rock Curls  IC (we did a few more as I didn't want to interrupt Hermes's jokes) Then we weave the balls and run the pickle.
- 17 x Rock triceps extensions IC Then weave the balls and run the pickle
- 17 x Chest Rock Bump Merkins On my Down then weave the balls and run the pickle
- 17 x Rock Rows IC Weave the balls and run the pickle

**Next**

In two heats, line up and sprint to the flag, around the loop and mosy back.  Line up and do this two more times for a total of three sprints.  On the last sprint, finish at the Basketball court.

**Mary**

- 17 x American Hammers
- 17 x Homer to Marge
- 17 x Box Cutters

Hermes was kind enough to allow us 17 one armed merkins with the right arm and 17 one armed merkins with the left arm.  FTL!

Finish up with a Have a Nice Day where I talked about the day ahead and being present for what comes.

**COT**

2017 kinda marks the beginning of me making a deliberate effort to make positive changes in my life.  I went from saying "sure I eat pretty good and I do get out and walk and yes, I have a bible on the coffee table" to actually eating better, exercising, and opening that bible and praying.  F3 has been a huge part of most of that.  Thank you guys, for standing in the gap for me those first few workouts and encouraging me.  I'm a high introvert but I find myself talking about "that group I work out with in the morning you should come" to everyone I meet.

I want to extend a big Thank You to everyone who came out to help me celebrate my birthday Q.  It's an honor and a privilege to lead you men and a brilliant way to start the day.
