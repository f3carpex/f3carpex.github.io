But it's not here yet! After 2 years of F3 I speak from experience when I say 28 degrees in not that cold. It may be colder than any morning in the last seven months but it's not cold enough to be used as an excuse. 7 extraordinary pax left the comfy confines of their homes to experience the best 90 minute bootcamp AO in Carpex. Disclaimer, Pledge, Follow Me.

Warm-up: After Qing 6 times already this week most of the pax had already been through my standard warm-up so they enjoyed taking shots at the Q upon going through it again. It was good mumble chatter. Side Straddle Hop, Steve Earle, J-Lo, Superman, Daisy Picker, Dive Bomber, Good Mornings. A quick mosey to pick up our coupons and off to the track.

Thangs 1-4: IPC Weeks 1-4. For those of you who participated in the Iron Pax Challenge you already have an idea of what this looked like. The biggest difference was that we only did one or two sets of each week.
