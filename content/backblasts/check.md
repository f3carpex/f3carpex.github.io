Slept in on a Saturday morning, but can still sleep in and make EC run prior to my Q at Off The Rails. The beauty of later starts on the weekend.

## Warm Up

We have an FNG, so make sure to give a solid disclaimer. Start off with The Pledge. Mosey to eventually reach the Thales Academy parking lot near the park. Hit the PAX with some SSHs, Good Mornings, Moroccan Night Clubs, Steve Earles, Calf and Runner's stretch, and 10 CF Merkins for good measure. All called with impeccable counting.

## The Thang

YHC's low running twist to the Standard Dora. Same sets of Merkins, Squats and LBCs. The difference is, PAX can only Bear Crawl, Lunge Walk, or Crab Walk across the parking lot. Flip flop until 100/200/300 completed.

A little time left so we do a set of 7s the long way across the same parking lot. Running must be backwards, and the exercises are World's Worst Merkins and Steaks' Star Jumps.

Mosey back to the flag, doing a PUT6 run along the way.

Time expired.

## COT

7 PAX, one Hate and two Respects. Welcome FNG Glee. YHC took us out.

## NMS

- Glee was once a performing singer, hence the name. He was EH'd by Triple Lindy, who failed to show.
- As always, there was an emphasis on proper form in performing the exercise.
- The Commish talked and never counted the entire 45 minutes.
- In addition, he left early for the EC run, so 2 EC runners headed in opposite directions.
- Ironically both EC runners were the 2 Respects this morning.
- Glee had a look of horror and disgust on his face in the middle of the Dora. I think he'll fit in just fine.
- MIAGD!
