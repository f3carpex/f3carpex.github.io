YHC and Michelob ran in to Peak City Beatdown. Monkey Nuts huffed it in too. The Pax was restless this morning. After witnessing a late night twitter war, they were curious to see who would lead them! YHC's goal of the morning was to be a pain in the ass, or at least make your ass have pain.

Freebird seemed to be clock free and was coming in hot, but he'd have to catch us if he wanted to feel some pain.
