## NMS

- Great running in this morning with Ma Bell, and glad he didn't make us stop for Merkins on the way.
- Swag gives a great disclaimer - no one could ever consider legal action after Swag's convincingly comprehensive disclaimer.
- Thanks to Vortex and Hope Solo for visiting & bringing FNGs - welcome Big Red & Wannacry.
- Biner is part wheelbarrow, part cyborg.
- Advance happy birthday to Sooey and Sooey's 2.0 who both share a birthday with YHC this Thursday (6/22).
- PAX were a little rambunctious around the wheelbarrowing fun today.
- Kilmer who on the long-long-long backward run, said, with meaning, those three little words...."I hate you".  This is the premium complement a Q can receive.  Thanks Kilmer for awarding me this prestigious honor.
- After PBX's Magical Mystery tour tweet, and our Abbey Road Lunges, it seems right to finish this BB on a Beatles theme (with apologies to Lennon/McCartney) - _What would you do if I Q out of cadence?  Would you stand up and walk out on me? Lend me your ears and I'll Q you a workout and I'll try not to Q out of Cadence....Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends........_
