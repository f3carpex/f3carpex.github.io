YHC started the morning with a nice little fellowship run with Hello Kitty. Got back to the flag and the PAX were already gathering. Nice mix of vets and new guys and guys we haven't seen recently. 05:45, let's roll!

**Warm-Up**

Mosey over to the parking lot next to Power Line Hill and circle up for hillbillies, side straddle hops, burpees, Sir Fazios and plank jacks.

**The Thang**

Mosey over towards Power Line Hill but take a surprise right turn and head down the stairs to the baseball field. Partner up for Dora 1-2-3, partner 1 starts knocking out 100 derkins, 200 dips and 300 squats while partner 2 runs to the top of the stairs, knocks out five merkins, then runs back down and flapjack.

Mosey down the hill then hang a left down the trail to the beautiful new pull-up bars. Unfortunately the storm last night left the area too muddy, so let's just admire them quickly and mosey back over to the hill.

Sevens on Power Line Hill with star jumps at the top and LBCs at the bottom.

Last trip up the hill, bear crawl as far as possible, lunge walk as much as necessary.

**Mary**

Mosey back to front parking lot and circle up for Mary with the PAX calling their favorite exercises, including low slow flutters, dying cock-a-roaches, American hammers and merkins.

**COT**

**Count-a-rama**:  18 **Name-a-rama**:  5 RESPECTs, 13 meh, 0 HATEs **Prayers / Praises**:  Praises for Hotspot's wife finding a new job, praises for Quiver hitting his one monthiversary, prayers for multiple PAX and families travelling over the next couple of weeks. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**

YHC was really looking forward to trying out those pull-up bars, alas the weather did not cooperate. Thanks to Notorious for putting them in, we'll make use of them soon enough.

Red Ryder is a monster. He reached the top of the hill first and bearcrawled the whole way. When I congratulated him he said he just wanted to get it over with as soon as possible.

Thanks to Hello Kitty for pulling me along during the EC pre-run.

Hotspot back in the gloom just two days after that brutal ride on the Crazy Train. Nails.

Burt showed up after saying he was headed for Kryptonite. He says he overslept, but we know he just wanted to get two scoops of Disco Duck vanilla.

The warm-up burpees were not my choice, my hand was forced when one of the PAX showed up at 05:47. But I did enjoy them.

Good to have Burt and Smokey back out in the gloom.

Proud to lead you men this morning. You guys are awesome and I'm so thankful I get to start my days getting after it with you.
