This morning was a perfect morning to get some good B.O. (The workout site not the stench...duh), and 8 pax got a healthy dose (of possibly both). The start time arrived sooner than expected, or so it seemed, not sure why. Maybe it was the Q-drinaline I don’t know. At any rate, after the mission statement was given, and the Pledge was recited, we were off and running to the big fountain at the top of Academy St.
