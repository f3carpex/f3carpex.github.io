Ab-stract:  existing in thought or as an idea but not having a physical or concrete existence.

Fear and Trepidation-

Gotta admit it fellas, SNS is like the Holy Grail (okay, wrong AO, that's Flying Circus) of Carpex workouts (sorry DZ) to me.  So much going on here on Wednesday mornings, that over the last 2.5 years YHC has been constantly growing more and more nervous about the possibility of ever Q'ing this site.  So this year, turning 45, I took a bold step forward.  I looked at the Q signup sheet for this week (Q swap week, maybe that helped my chances), and saw 4 open slots PLUS I already had signed up to Q Whiplash in Raleigh on the 13th.

So it was set.  With the Q swap week in high gear, I had already gotten wind of some exercises we would definitely avoid.  "Erebody" knows I'm more of a runner, so you have all helped round me out into a more balanced person.

Alas, you are learning this week that YHC likes to cram a lot into a workout.  Miles, workouts, reps, snowball fights, so time is a factor.  Kryptonite, we'll chalk that one up to the icy parking lot.  FOD ended right on time, thank you very much.  But we only eked out 1.NINE7 miles, so there is that.  Today, today was my big debut, my one shot.  And it ALMOST worked.

Fear and Trepidation-I looked up the reference, here's a verse that came up.

Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed--not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence--continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling, (Philippians 2:12)

Still processing that one a little.  Lemme know your thoughts.  All I know is, once we got rolling, and through those 45 SSHs (that didn't QUITE take 11 minutes), things got better. I'm still fearful of disappointing the PAX during my Q, and muscles still trembling a little from lugging that rock around.  Hope y'all enjoyed.

**Warmup**

Run around the pickle (on your way by it, grab a handful of snow and toss a snowball...a couple of them zinged by me with a WHOOSH!!!)  Carioca right and left along the way, then arc up for:

- Pledge of Allegiance in cadence

Follow me up to the Community Center for:

- SSH x 45 (yep, OM is officially on the other side of the curve now)
- IW x 15
- Cotton Picker x 15
- Std Merkin x 15

**Start of the Thang**

Run up to the rockpile, count off into 1s and 2s.  Pair up with another number.  (which basically meant look to your left and right and grab who's next to you)

1s grab a rock to share with your 2, and head to the wall.

Round 1:

- 1s 5 Rock Wolverines (kinda like a Rockee, but w/3 Merkins in there)
- 2s BTTW
- Flapjack x 3

Intermission was a run around the lot, with your rock

Round 2:

- 1s 5 LBCs, 5 jump squats, 5 Merkins
- 2s Rock Your Body
- Flapjack x 3

**More of the Thang**

Rocks back, follow me to the kiosk (6:06 fellas, that took longer than YHC planned.  Which means he did not plan well):

- At the Kiosk, assume the plank position
- Wave Merkins x 5 each counterclockwise around the circle while performing plank variations.  (T-claps Burt for being the last dude in the wave, and banging out the strongest Merkins...sorry Ma Bell, couldn't see yours)

Still at the kiosk:

- 1s Bear Crawl or Lunge Walk your choice to the sign 1/2 (okay, 3/4) -way up the hill, then run down
- 2s WWII x 10, American Hammer x 10 alternating until your 1 returns
- Flapjack

On the move again, this time to the shelter down by the trail for:

- 1s tabletop derkins x 10, tabletop irkins x 10
- 2s run the loop
- Flapjack

Knew we were getting close on time, as here came the Vesper crew.  Forgetting for a moment who was the Q, YHC said "Hey let's go catch the Vespers" and the herd was off to the races.  "Whoa whoa, just kidding guys!" and we proceeded on up towards our finale.  But we woulda taken them :)

Intermission at the gate to get everyone together, then YHC asked told LargeMouth to take the point up to the T-intersection and lead 'em through 15 diamonds and 15 wide grips.  2nd wave arrived to finish the last few widegrips :)  THX Large, I needed to heed Burt's advice (and leave no man behind).

Final run, 6:26 fellas.  Lightpoles.  Gettin' the stinkeye from every angle, lotsa talk about the 4th F (c'mon guys, I'm only half through "Freed to Lead", cutmesomeSlack...see what I did there?)

- Run to the lightpole, 5 jump squats
- Run to the lightpole, 5 Merkins
- Run to the lightpole, 5 jump squats
- Run to the lightpole, 5 offset left merkins
- Run to the lightpole, 5 jump squats
- Run to the lightpole, 5 offset right merkins
- Run to the billy run line and plank
- On 3, go...123go!

**COT**

Came in hot to COT (I think it was already underway since about lightpole 5) to all of Vesper back (when's the last time that happened??)  Vesper's getting fast (and it _was_ 6:31).  Wanted to give the PAX a full 45.  Countarama 31. Plus Callahan of course.  He always counts.  Honestly I don't know the Vesper/SNS split, but I know it was an odd number in SNS, as I was flying solo.  Had to have been 21 or 23 or so.  7 Respects, a hate, and a whole buncha mehs.

**Announcements**

BRR interest meeting tonight at Dohertry's.

Bond Brothers Beer Mile settled on 6:30 start time.

**Prayer Concerns**

Pierogi's coworker and friend with health issues.

Praise for Water Wings growing family.

Prayers for Hasslehoff's family displaced by water damage at home.

**NMS**

Y'all give it up for Smokey.  Remember early on when he started coming, today'd been a long day in the saddle.  As it was, he was all smiles as we were heading for the lightpoles, and was right there with the PAX all morning.  Really proud of his dedication and commitment.  YHC enjoyed seeing everyone working hard this morning.  Really enjoyed the grunts heard during the OMD Merkins early on.  And you can thank him for the backblast title.  We got into a discussion about counting reps or flapjack occurrence or something like that during the wall/rock work, and it degraded from there.  "The next exercise is the Abstract...".  What IS the starting position?  Sounds like a Picasso painting or some such.  Oh, and as men of F3, I would say that we are anything BUT abstract.  We have  a physical and concrete (sometimes hardened and chiseled, sometimes still setting up) existence, and we need to do the best we can with it.

YHC HC'd for Insomnia in a moment of weakness last night.  Said I'd take it easy, said I'd just work to make sure I was back by 0540.  Then Large and Chanticleer took off (and a few other eager beavers).  And Michelob didn't go with 'em, so I felt like I should go.  We settled in at a nice (read: breathtaking) pace within the first half mile.  I was pretty sure I'd pass out but miraculously did not.  Large and Shawn T. Clear were just chatting away, and I could barely breathe.  Then I notice we are being spotlighted from behind.  And hear a voice "hey, y'all mind if I shine my light?" Kinda like asking "Mind if I play through?"  It was Wonderbread, who broke ranks from the crew giving chase, and was just flying along right behind us.  "Gasp, pant, phew....sure"  from me.  Anyway, we finally settled in on a solid pace for 4.25 miles.

Big mistake.

YHC was toast at the start of SNS.  It's been a while (months) since I've had 3 consecutive posts.  Sad, yep.  But never have I Q'd 3 consecutive days.  Going for a 4th tomorrow at FC.  @sfleder offered to give me SWW Friday, but I turned it down.  Got a Whiplash Q coming up Saturday.  I've realized this week that I'm just not as young as I used to be.  Recovery takes longer.  It takes longer to warm up.

But today, once I got over the warmup, I started to feel alive.  Running around in the gloom with you all seems crazy to the outside world, but is just the way I want to start my day.  Everything else is easy when compared to the work we do with our bodies, our minds, and our hearts.  Even when faced with heavy stuff, we can lean on each other and grow into the trouble, the pain.  I made some resolutions this year that are going to be tough for me to keep.  And I've got some more that I'm still easing into.  I know that you all will help me keep them, just be continuing to push me when we're together (and when we're not).

In the words of the infamous Burt, MIAGD.
