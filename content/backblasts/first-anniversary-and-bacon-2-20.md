Is they a direct relationship on how long you put off writing a back blast and how good it is?  For me, the longer I put it off the shorter it becomes. Probably a matter of opinion if that make it better or not.

1 FNG - Disclaimer by Joe Smith. Nicely done for a lawyer.

Run to Chanticleer's for Warmup - SSH, IW, GM. Merkins+Mountain Climbers+Plank Jacks

Run back to the Park parking lot and partner up.  Run in opposite directions for Partner hand release Merkins. 10 count X 4.  This is for Glass Joe who thinks it is the perfect no cheating exercise.

Next Up Rock Work - 10 curls, 10 ohp, 10 tricep extensions, 1 lap, 10 rock rows, 10 curls, 10 ohp, 10 tricep extensions, 1 lap, 5 rock burpees.

Hermes Turn - "Run to the bridge, 10 monkey humpers in cadence while imagining a crossfit gym behind you, BTTW on the bridge competing for who can last the longest, LBC’s at end of bridge until the last guy finishes.  Repeat that.  Run back to park, get a ball for some Derkins Irkins and Dips in cadence.  5 penalty burpees for YHC letting out some class 2 profanity.  Jog back to the flag."

COT

Welcome FNG - Tofu

Your choice of Bacon - bacon or turkey bacon.
