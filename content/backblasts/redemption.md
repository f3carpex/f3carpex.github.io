So it was a day to redeem myself for my less than strong Q at Hells Bells the previous day. The workout was well designed—maybe the best is Carpex’s history—but I had not considered the effects of the Odyssey on my body.

5:45: We had an FNG (that’s my story and I’m sticking to it) so I rattled off the disclaimer (“we won’t leave you where we found you, but we will leave you in a well lit area. Probably.”). A quick count revealed a perfect dozen PAX including YHC. The day was starting off great...and then Skipper said he was leaving.

I ordered the other PAX to let the air out of Skipper’s tires but they refused and he escaped into the gloom.

Warm up:

A quick mosey to the right parking lot via the pickle. We did some warm up exercises. They were glorious.

The Thang:

Partner Up (look one lonely Q, alone, just like kickball, baseball, prom...thanks Skipper).

Grab an ego rock per team for a DORA

100 burpees

200 jump squats

300 V-UPS

Traveling partner lunge walks to the top of the parking lot with the rock and back down.

Mary: PAX choice

COT:

Count-a-Rama: 5 respects, 6 Mehs

Announcements/Prayers/Praises:

Still 3 shirts for the Odyssey to be purchased to fill the order quota (as of 10/15). Only 7 days left!

NMS:

It was great to lead today. Tomorrow is not guaranteed.
