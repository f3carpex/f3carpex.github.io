With expectations high for a sophomore Q and accompanying backblast, I opted for a simple schoolhouse theme in honor of the Hot for Teacher AO. A lovely, moonbright, 40-degree morning for a workout. Again, lots of ECers and although I was not one of them, I did show up a bit earlier to check off the [Carpex Core Challenge](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y3iN8sOgKgMIEh146kpgnuGVjiJ-umE8ZZHvz_c8cac/edit), courtesy of Prodigal.

## Warmup

Trick mosey, then:

- **Side-straddle hop** IC 15-count.
- **Imperial walkers** IC 15-count.
- **TIE Fighters** IC 10-count fwd, 10-count rev. A newer edition to the exicon debuted by Hello Kitty at Rush Hour this week. Sound effects encouraged.
- **Mountain climbers** IC 15-count.
- **Calf stretch** for 10-count each side.

## Pre-Thang: Timeouts

Mosey towards the park, and halt for some penalty burpees. I don't think anyone was late to the AO per se, but someone came into the circle after I had already begun talking at 0530 so...several Pax also suggested they were in honor of temporarily sidelined comrade Hamm.

At the shelter, Pax partnered up for something I called **Timeouts**.

- Partner 1 does **Bench Dips** for ascending 8, 10, 12, 15 counts.
- Partner 2 does **Balls-to-Wall** until Partner 1 finishes dips.
- I believe Suck Up and Queequeg were first to finish, so kudos.

## Thang 1: ABC Dora

At the far end of the parking lot, we settle in for a Dora. Unbeknownst to me, there was a tennis court that would have made for a more convenient location, but alas.

- While Partner 1 jogs up the parking lot and back, Partner 2 whittles away at the ABC's.
- **100 of A is for Air Chairs** (or Air Squats if feeling frisky).
- **200 of B is for Bear Plank Hold**, in 1-Mississippi, 2-Mississippi, etc. count.
- **300 of C is for Crabcakes**, originally left-right 1, but it was dragging along so I made the executive decision to switch to single-count, with encouragement from the Pax.

## Thang 2: Do-re-mi String of Pearls

For the return journey to the flag, we performed a musical string of pearls with 7 stations for the do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti scale, each exercise beginning with the same letter so that I could remember them all. Creativity encouraged, several Pax even sang the Sound of Music song...I believe 16 Steves was the only Boy Band member to do so, so I guess that makes him the frontman???

- **Do is for Derkins** 15-count.
- **Re is for Rockette Hillbillies**, IC 15-count, like regular hillbillies but with a kick, karate sounds appreciated.
- **Mi is for Merkins** 15-count with last hold. The Pax knew this was coming.
- **Fa is for Flying Nuns** basically Sir Fazio's while lunging, just until I called a halt. Unsure of the origin, but I did not make this one up, you can check the exicon.
- **Sol is for Scorpion Dry Docks**, a Carolina Dry Dock with one leg up, 10-count each leg.
- **La is for Lt. Dan's** ascending count until halt is called.
- **Ti is for Travolta Merkins** back at the flag, 15-count. Lots of Boy Band potential for this move.

## Mary

Already at the flag. A potential Jason Stratham-style heist was witnessed, so those in attendance, please check the local news.

- **LBCs** on the up for 30 or 40 count, can't recall.
- **Runner's stretch** goes without saying.
- Have a nice day.

## COT

Count-a-rama: 15 Pax. Tanktop Thursday was observed by about one-third.

Announcements:

- New AO! Hardlaunch of Piranha Park this Saturday 0645 at Apex Nature Park (same park as Dante's Peak but the other parking lot).
- Soft launch of 2021 Hills Challenge April 15th, Cary vs. Apex, along with counting towards Shield Locks and BRR groups.

Prayers:

- Disco Duck's grandmother's recovery
- Hamm's recovery

Praises:

- Yahoo's safe return

YHC took us out.

Thanks all for coming out, also nice attendance at 2nd F to the point where the staff asked what days we come so they have enough coffee. MIAGD!
