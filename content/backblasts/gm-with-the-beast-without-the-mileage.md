AO: The Green Mile

Date: 12/28/19

PAX: Biner, Crimson, Deuce, Disco Duck, Trike, WWW

This workout was a week beyond schedule. The original date was 12/21/19. Unfortunately, I picked up a 48 hr cold bug on 12/20 which, I could not shake off. I had to give up my Q to true HIM, Franklin. He was gracious enough to accept a Q swap on short notice. It was greatly appreciated.

I pre-blasted that GM would not be the normal mileage workout but pre-empted with it would be a full-body obliteration with your ruck or breath-taker.

The weather was absolutely awesome! 48 degrees, minimal wind, no rain in the forecast, and clear skies. Great day in the gloom to do a few rounds with the beast.

I got out early to prep the beast arena. Here is what the beast was like.

At 0530 hrs, only 6 HIMs was in attendance. No FNG, F3ministravia done, and we Pledged Our Allegiance to an imaginary Old Glory. We did not have a shovel flag planted. All is good because it definitely did not stop us.

With a ruck / breath-taker / bricks in hand, we moseyed to get the legs warmed up. Circle up for warm-up.

Warm-up: GM, daisy pickers, Sir Fazio, merkins.

After warm-up, we did a speed march until we get to the beast arena for the thang.

After round 3, we gathered our ruck / breath-taker and headed back to the imaginary shovel flag.

Since we had some time to spare before Mary, QIC/YHC grabs prepares the music and speaker for Thunderstruck.

For the sake of time, instead of Mary, we did stretching. Runner’s stretch, some yoga with dive bombers, hip flexor stretches, more GMs, lower back stretches.

Have a nice day!

It is always an honor to get out in the gloom with my Brothers who just want to workout and fellowship so they can accelerate in life.
