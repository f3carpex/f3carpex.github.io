Been to Claymore a few times lately as YHC was on the IR for a few weeks. Time to step up and lead - and to show that you can get a really great workout without much running.

## Warm Up

Mosey to the circle near the tennis courts following the Pledge. Circle up for SSHs, Sir Fazio arm circles forward and reverse, and Steve Earles.

## The Thang

Mosey to the tennis courts, head to a far corner. The routine: call an exercise, PAX do up to 100 reps. First PAX to 100 calls it out, all PAX finish within 5 seconds. Then mosey to the opposite corner of the courts for the next exercise. 10 exercises up to 100 reps each, 10 moseys. The exercises:

- Merkins
- Freddie Mercs
- Lunges
- Shoulder taps
- Sumo squats
- Plank Jacks
- CDDs
- Dying Cockroaches
- Mountain Climbers
- Flutter kicks

After the final mosey, complete 21 burpees

A little time left so head back to the circle - bear crawl around to the opposite side, complete 25 squats, bear crawl back to the start. Mosey to the flag.

## Mary

Complete 10 burpees as a reward for Chewie being late. Then PAX choice around the circle, HAND.

## COT

1 Honor, 4 Respects, 4 Mehs and 1 Kitty. YHC took us out after taking announcements and prayers/praises.

## NMS

- This workout is called the Millennial, and my M did this at a FIA workout. I let the studs know AFTER the workout was over.
- Kwik Stop is still fast
- Pierogi got lost on his way to FMJ, glad we found him.
- MIAGD, and be just a little better today than you were yesterday!
