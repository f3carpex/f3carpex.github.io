Following a night of unstable air and thunderstorms, 20 PAX descended upon Tortoises in the humid gloom for a 45 minutes of getting to know your coupon better.  Allegiance was pledged, and we circled up.

**Warm Up**

Standard fare of SSHs, Cotton Pickers, Sir Fazio, Plank Jacks, Merkins on my down AND up.  10 burpees OYO to get the PAX attention.

**Thang 1**

Lunge walk to the coupon pile.  PAX take either a block or 2 cores each.  Partner up, size doesn't matter.  Dora 1-1-1-1 with curls, rows, overhead press & squats.  Other partner does lunge walk with coupon across the parking lot, standard walk back.  Here's the kicker - at each partner switch, complete 5 bropees.

5 burpees OYO when Burt drops his coupon and breaks it.

**Thang 2**

Keep partners, half the group to the pullup bars to complete 5 pullups each, the other half to the picnic tables for L/R stepups WITH COUPON.  Flip flop X 2.

Quick walk to return coupons, completing 10 overhead presses on the way.  Once coupons are returned, bear crawl back to the flag.

American Hammers X 20, Have a Nice Day

**COT**

2 Hates, 7 Respects, 11 Mehs

Announcements: New rotating IR AO called Bruisers; check Slack for locations.  Per WWW, if you call it then you Q it.

Carpex Anniversary convergence at Danger Zone 8/31.  9/11 stair climb t-shirt orders needed yesterday.

Prayers/Praises: Quiver's friends dad passed away, praises that the mass on Spartan's M's neck was benign, Pickles' niece's health as well as his wedding anniversary, McCants' recovery, Lee Adkins with a cancer diagnosis & Robbie Helbert's recovery from double lung transplant.

YHC took us out.

**NMS**

- Strong mumblechatter from this group.  The usual offenders
- Probably need to separate Burt & Liverpool right from the start
- As stated above, we are down 1 block at Tortoises.  FYI
- The Pullup EC is growing - nice work.  T-Claps to Jonah for post-workout pullups, trying out all the different grips.
- Disco claimed we saw angry Ryder; I was just making a point, letting the PAX know who is in charge.  We were going to do those burpees anyway.
- Hotty Toddy has this Planet of the Apes-style bear crawl nailed.  If you call a Billy Bear Crawl, be aware.
- Strong group today.  Tortoises was the first spot I ever posted.  That first time out, I thought I was going to die.  But I posted again, then again.  And so on.  And here we are about a year later.
- Thanks for allowing me to lead today.  Be a little better today than you were yesterday.
