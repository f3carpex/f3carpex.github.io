So today is December 31st, so naturally the last day of the year 2020. What a year it's been, to say the least. I figured what better way to Q the first workout of the last day of 2020 than to use it as a theme. I decided to do 20 reps of 20 exercises in a 4 corners situation. Here's what we did:

**Warmup**: YHC and 7 Pax at the flag (almost) at 0515 on an extra gloomy day. No FNGs, quick mission statement and the pledge and we're off. 2 laps around the parking lot just to try and get warmed up a little. Circle up for YHC's standard warmup of:  
SSH x 15 IC  
Good Mornings x 5 IC  
Sir Fazio Arm Circles x 10 IC  
Seal Claps x 10 IC  
Imperial Walkers x 10 IC  
Plank Jacks x 10 IC  
Calf Stretch L/R x 10 silent count each side

**The Thang:** Mosey over to the big parking lot for the main event. As previously stated, we did 20 reps of 20 exercises in the 4 corners. Here are the exercises:  
Merkins   
Hand release merkins   
Scorpion dry docks  
Shoulder taps   
Peter Parker Merkins

Dying cockroaches  
Freddy mercury

**Mary**: We wrapped up just in time to head back to the flag for some stretching since we covered a good bit of Mary during the main event.  
Runners Stretch, Pigeon Stretch, Glute Stretch and butterfly were all called followed by have a nice day.

**COT**: Announcements- Carrying place this Sunday. Details on slack. Duck Donuts Dash Feb 6th.  
Prayers/Praises- Thanks for the push this year gents. For YHC, 1000 miles, first 1/2 marathon, first BRR, 27 Qs. Be thankful for each other, for our families and the extra time we had to spend with them, and for our health and the ability to come out and get better. YHC took us out.
