Welcome to the 3rd installment of Flaccoversary Week 2018, and only the 2nd installment Q'd by YHC! After an unexpected business trip to Virginia preempted the 2nd installment (that was graciously Q'd by Sabre), YHC felt the need to get swolt. (And my legs aren't working very well since the lungefest at SNS, so upper body seemed the way to go.) So my M went to Crate & Barrel to buy me something nice for my Flaccoversary, and she found Merkins on sale. I told her to scoop up the whole lot of them. So here's how it went down:

**Warm Up**

Mosey to the soccer field. Not being too familiar with Dante's Peak, YHC needed a little navigation to find the entrance. Circle up gents for some warmups:

Good morning x10 Let it Hang x10 ct Bi-Directional Sir Fazio Arm Circles x10 each direction Imperial Walkers x15

**The Thang**

We did a lot of Merkins. 24 varieties were written on cards and drawn from a Crate & Barrel bag. One lucky PAX rolled a Dungeons & Dragons die to select the rep count. Q got creative to add where necessary. Here's my best recollection of those drawn from the bag:

World's Worst Merkin Breakdance Merkin Standard Merkin Del Brown Diamond David Lee Roth Burpee Laney Vu Merk Mucho Chesto ATMs Anglers Ascending Testicles

Like I said, we did a lot of Merkins, with few moseys across the soccer field and back to give our massive pectorials a break.

Mosey back to the flag for a speed round of COT

**Announcements:** It' Friday, not Monday (thanks Shut-In); Odyssey 10/20; 11/11 Duke race (see Water Wings post on Slack); Our Carpex Tuna team is down a man - know anyone who wants to join the team? See Hotspot.

**Praise/Prayers:** Hot Spot's dad - continued recovery from fall/neck break; Red Ryder's mom recovering from pneumonia; Red Ryder's son recovering from car crash; Shut-In's brother Open-Out and recent heart scare/upcoming test; YHC's FIL and family starting to deal with dementia issues

**NMS**

- "Merkin Monday, but on a Friday" was inspired by Taco Tuesday from 'The LEGO Movie'. In case you were wondering. Or not.
- It wasn't really a Dungeons & Dragons die, but I really wished it had been. Next time.
- I hoped to make Ma Bell proud. But my chest hurts. A lot. That'll do.
- Many thanks to Pivot for his expert demonstrations.
- Crimson is a Bad-Ass Merkinator. And all around nice guy.
- Thanks to everyone that has made this past year such an amazing growth year for me, and I pray that I can always be there to support you guys the way you do me (even if you don't know it).
