YHC’s first stab at a last-minute Q as I have tended to start planning my Qs a week or so out. This was much less stressful, and I appreciate the support of all of the PAX.

Great to see some less familiar faces like Lawn Dart (who is easily recognizable due to his hat). Will he still wear it when the weather changes), Kilmer and Thurston.

Thanks to Biner for the timer support.

Badlands beard is legit.

Sabre was seen running towards the entrance and away from the shovel flag shortly before the workout, but he decided to return for the beatdown.

Speaking of shovel flag, there was none

Nature Boy is stubborn about getting his parking spot(s)

Always an honor and a pleasure to lead these fine men
