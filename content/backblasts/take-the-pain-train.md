Great to come home to my V post 5 ½ years ago and reminisce about Ma Bell 50TH birthday week Q fest.

Thanks to Voltron from Lexington, SC who introduced me to Pain Train at Point Break Wednesday. I was pretty sure that I could bring it DZ and not have anyone from PB in attendance.

Glad the field wasn’t too muddy. Just a little bit of frost

The derkins did me in as Callahan noted. But at least I was trying to do them

Props to Coxswain for being the king of the DZ pickle

Always an honor to lead. Love you guys
