A few weeks ago I wore my "Where the Heck is Ausfahrt?" shirt when I posted. And HIM Ausfahrt was not there. This prompted some to speak with a German accent... which eventually led to Hans and Franz and "Pumping You Up". What better theme for a workout than to play songs about girls and get pumped with kettle bells? With my Ausfahrt shirt on and music paused for the pledge we began.

Semi-disclaimer given and we plowed into the first exercise:

- Pledge to the flag
- Silence to Remember Veteran's Day

Run pickle & warmup:

- Good Mornings
    
- Strawberry pickers
    
- SSH
    
- Princess Francine Arm Circles w/make them bigger \[NOT Sir Fazio\]
    
- Mountain Climbers
    
- Seal Clap

#### THANG 1:

Tabitha (Tabata) w/ 7 stations, 2 rounds

- LBC w/KB
    
- Lawn Mowers

- Triceps

#### THANG 2:

Cindy (1/2 Murph)

- 50 pullups
- 100 Merkins

Time ran out on us - I didn't get to finish my Cindy, but others may have.

#### Prayers/ Praises:

- Veterans for their service to our country
- Yahoo's pending adoption - with God's help it will all work out.

YHC took us out. Thank God for the ability to push ourselves this morning. Encourage others today.

#### NMS:

I haven't Q'd in a while - I've been caught up Qing QSource leadership training every week. It was great to get back into it. There are many aspects to being a Q that you don't remember and practice unless you Q often. If you haven't Q'd in a while, it's time to step up! It was a pleasure being able to start Carpex's #respectweek off at Hells Bells.
