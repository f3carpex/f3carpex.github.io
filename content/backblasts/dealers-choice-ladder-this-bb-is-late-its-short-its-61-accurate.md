Date:  June 25, 2018

Weather:   101 degrees, Humid, Clear, Wet fields.

21 Pax showed up for a little cluster at Wolverine.   A nice little site located between a couple of soccer fields.   We had an FNG.....we named him Go Blue...which made Hi Liter happy.

**Warm Up:**  Mosey over to the soccer field.   Circle up for a warm up of the usual.  SSH, GM, SSH, GM, SSH, LBJs, Jump Squats.

**Thang:**   4 cones are placed on the field.    Pax line up on one end and a Pax calls an exercise and all of us do the move with 5, 10, 15 on the way down and 10, 5 on the way back.   8 moves were called including merkins, jump squats, plank jacks, lbcs, etc, etc,     We did 5 burpees at the end.

We did a Jack Webb at some point.

We ran back to the parking lot for Mary....which was spectacular.

Prayers.

Dudes,  I truly enjoy working out with you all.   I do not enjoy writing BB's.

Ya'll Be Good Now.

Out.
