Lots of mumble chatter on social media this week about parts of Carpex that we needed to tighten up. Somebody's gotta do it, might as well be YHC.

**Warm-Up**

Mosey over to the bank and circle up for side straddle hops, imperial walkers, copperhead squats, plank jacks and copperhead merkins.

**The Thang**

Mosey down to the library and partner up. Partner one will take a lap around the library parking lot while partner two alternates ten reps of two exercises. Flap jack until both partners have done three laps.

First Round

**G**orilla humpers (monkey humpers with a wider stance) **R**anger merkins (hands close to ribs)

Second Round

**U**p squats (similar to jump squats) **N**ormal merkins (similar to standard merkins)

Third Round

**D**ying cock-a-roaches **L**bc's

**Mary**

Running out of time so mosey back to the flag and circle up for

**E**leven homer-to-marge

**COT**

**Count-a-rama**:  13 **Name-a-rama**:  2 RESPECTs, 10 meh, 1 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for improved health for Captain Kirk's mother, prayers for Old Maid's friends with a daughter in the hospital, praises for Callahan's friends who just had triplets **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**

You ever try to find an exercise that starts with U or N?

Five of us got in a nice little EC run before the workout. By five of us I mean five guys other than me.

As we moseyed to the library an old lady on the other side of the street criticized us for running too slow. Callahan was behind us, walking with his bag of rice, and he got the worst of it. She asked why he wasn't even running and he explained that he was injured. She responded, "You don't look injured to me!" It was that kind of morning.

Callahan's leg may be injured, but his mind is still strong. I believe he was the first one to recognize today's theme.

I had a lot of fun out there this morning, thanks for letting me lead.
