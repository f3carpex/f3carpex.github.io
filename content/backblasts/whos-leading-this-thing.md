YHC had been tracking the rush hour Q spot all day waiting on my 2.0 to get home to see if he wanted to go to Rush Hour since his scout meeting was cancelled. Once work was finished and the plan for Rush Hour was decided we had a slack messaging stating the Q was none other than the Triple Lindy and site Q Kermit. After much discussion it was decided that the name on the Q sheet is the official Q so off we went.

Arrived at 5:38, traffic this time of day is terrible!

At 5:44:40 the PAX were anxious and it looked like we had our group. Quick disclaimer and off to the warm up.

Jog across the parking lot and circle up for:

- Good Afternoons
- Standard Merkins
- Mountain Climbers
- Sir Fazio Arm Circles
- SSH

Enough of that, off to the top of the parking deck!

Thing 1: Run down parking deck, stopping at each end. Merkins on the far side, squats on the near side.

Thing 2: Once at the bottom, grab some pain sticks. Two PAX carry pain sticks up stairs to top level and back down while PAX did 5 burpees and ran out and back to the stop sign. Repeato.

Thing 3: Mosey over to the Police Station and partner up. Bear crawl across the sidewalk while your partner does dips, derkins, and urkins. Repeato.

Thing 4: Mosey back the grass near the flag for Dora: 50 Merkins, 100 LBCs, and 150 Squats.

Quick jog around the parking lot then back for Mary.

Mary: PAX choice, even Q-bert called a Mary exercise!

Announcements: Trivia at Jordan Lake Brewery, Odyssey, BBQ Picnic. More on Slack

Praises for Qbert's interest and strong showing at his 6th F3 post!

Surprise guest appearance by Skipper, he just showed up for the beer!

YHC took us out. Always a pleasure to lead. Take time to make a difference in someone's life today! We are the hands and feet of our faith. Don't be afraid to lead and respond to the calling that you have to help others!
