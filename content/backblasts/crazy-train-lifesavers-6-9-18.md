Lifesaver: A thing that saves one from serious difficulty, a ring-shaped life preserver, a piece of candy.  AKA: Disco Duck, Yoga Mat and Dice!

The Thang: 12 Pax Met at Bradford's Ordinary 6/9 at 0745.  Scratch that the train is delayed (of course), make it 0845. Some got in some 2nd F at LeFarm and some just hung out at the house a little longer. Mosey over to the Train Station and wait on the 92 Silver Star scheduled to leave Cary at 0808 and arrive in Raleigh at 0834.

Welcome FNG Hate Barista and FNG Banana Boat, welcome the South Wake Contingency: WebEx.

The Thang 2, 3, 4 and 5: Wait, wait, wait and wait for the train. The Thang 6: Get off the train at 10:03 AM in Raleigh, left on Cabarrus, Left on Dawson, Left on Hillsborough Street, watch Barista turn all the co-ed's heads as he struts down Hillsborough Street.  Cut over onto Meredith College campus, take the greenway down under Wade Ave and up to the bridge over 440 to the art museum.  Begin contemplating all the choices you have made in your life that have led up to this moment, begin wondering how far it is to the Infirmary on NCSU's campus and if Flip Flop would be there.  Begin cursing the train for being late and the extra cups of coffee and inadequate amount of water.  Finally make it to the Art Museum parking lot aka Whiplash and see the most glorious site you have ever witnessed - The Trifecta of Life Savers waiting with coolers of water and a shade tent and towels and chairs and orange slices and bananas and granola bars and snacks and words of encouragement in a nice ring shaped life preserver.  Rest, notice that you have goose bumps and wonder if that is one of the pre-heat stroke symptoms.  (YHC bailed at this point and took the sag wagon to the next Aid station).  11 Pax continued on down Reedy Creek road into Umstead Park.  10 Pax made a left at the lake and passed YHC who had cooled down a little and started running back.  1 Pax made a wrong no-turn and was recovered by of course one of our Life Savers.  At Harrison Entrance at Umstead pause to take another break with the lifesavers.  Continue down Harrison stopping briefly for some more aid.  Left on Chatham, Right at the Pimento Cheese Crowd, left on Waldo back to BO for some more aid.

Roughly 14 miles covered for 11 Pax, YHC was more like 11-12 miles.

NMS: The link to the Lifesavers BB: https://f3carpex.com/2018/06/12/care-and-feeding-of-a-crazy-train/ How about that time Barista told us he did a half marathon earlier this year in 1:23 and his best mile time was 4:35?  What do you think about them apples Largemouth? Chanticleer?  Heck, i'd probably put him up against Michelob and Frey Daddy in non-ultra events.  Okay, okay, he was born in 1997 if that makes you feel better.

I need to again acknowledge Dice, Yoga Mat and Disco Duck for being the truly High Impact Men that I can only dream of being.  I appreciate you guys sacrificing your Saturday morning to take care of your brothers and make sure we survived!

Next time will be in cooler weather or maybe at night with a Ruck!I

The general consensus of the inaugural crazy train was that it was:

1\. Hotter than a billy goat with a blow torch.

2\. It’s so hot I saw a squirrel putting suntan oil on his nuts.

3\. Hotter than Satan’s house-cat.

4\. Hotter than two hamsters farting in a wool sock.

5\. Hotter than Satan’s toenails.

6\. Hotter than a four-peckered billy goat.

7\. It is hotter than a jalapeño’s armpit.

8\. It’s hotter than hell’s pepper patch.

9\. It’s hotter than Hell and half of Georgia.

10\. It’s hotter than the Devil’s armpit.
