On the drive home I started to think about what I wanted to title this BB, but I had too many possibilities running through my head. I didn't think it would be fair to just pick one, so feel free to chose your favorite.

1. Oh you're saying Lou's. I thought you were saying Lose. (see below)
2. Blisters Installed Here
3. If we were on American Ninja Warrior our shirts would say F3 Ninja
4. That was the "Worst Thing Ever!"

So when I pulled into the parking lot with only 8 minutes before GO time and just saw 1 car, I knew it was going to be a small crowd. But just how small? Slowly a few more HIMs arrived, and by the time our visiting PAX LB from Davidson ran up from the lower parking lot where he'd been sitting for 10 minutes we had 7 ready to take on the challenge.

But first. "So what does LB stand for?" we asked. "Lose Bitch" we thought he said. "Lose Bitch?" we questioned. "What does that mean?" LB responded "Well my wife's name is Lou, so I am Lou's Bitch." "Ooohhh that makes sense. It still sucks, but it makes sense." And we're off. A quick mosey to the lower parking lot.

**Warm Up**

Imperial Walker, SSH. Steve Earle, Sir Fazio Arm Circles (side note: Chanticleer and I met Sir Fazio last week. He's just a normal guy in Raleigh. I just always assumed he was some sort of Knight in the Queen's Royal Army.)

**Thang 1**

We took the greenway to the other side of the bridge and found ourselves at the bottom of the winding path for 7's. Jack Jack Webbs at the bottom Star Jumps at the top.

**Thang 2**

Finishing at the far end of the bridge, we needed to figure out a way to get to the other side. I had options.

Option #1: Inspired by American Ninja Warrior you can hang from the top of the fence and monkey-bar shuffle your way across. When tired you can drop, then get into the BTTW position and continue walking on your hands. When you can't go any further, stop and do 10 squats and start that all over again until you get to the other side.

Option #2: Crawl Crab stopping every 20 ft or so to do 10 squats and resume until you cross the bridge.

Both options were challenging in their own way, but the monkey-bar thing was a true test. It left us all with a sense of pride, multiple blisters on our hands and was deemed "The Worst Thing Ever" by Term Paper.

**Thang 3**

Giving our upper body a well deserved break, we ran to where the greenway splits off, and partnered up.

P1 ran backwards up the hill to the gate and completed 1 burpee. Regular back down. P2 started on 100 each of WWII, Freddy Mercury, Low Slow Flutter, LBC Switch with Partner until complete.

Mosey back to the flag.

**Mary**

Just enough time for some plank hold variations and (you guessed it) 100s.

**COT**

Announcements: Flacco's Party is Thursday; Night Train is Friday Prayers: For Flacco's grandmother & Mississippi's dad. Also for Chanticleer's child starting kindergarten today.

YHC took us out with Rudyard Kippling's poem "If"

> If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too. If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, Or being lied about, don't deal in lies, Or being hated, don't give way to hating, And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:
> 
> If you can dream—and not make dreams your master; If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim; If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster, And treat those two impostors just the same; If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:
> 
> If you can make a heap of all your winnings And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings And never breathe a word about your loss; If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there is nothing in you Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!"
> 
> If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch, If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, If all men count with you, but none too much; If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds' worth of distance run, Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son!
