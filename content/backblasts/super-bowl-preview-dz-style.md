TP and Flip Flop honored to have led this fine group of men this morning

**NMS** Many chose to get in the spirit of the theme and wear NFL gear. Well done! Sky Blue showed up in a futbol jersey Saban even wore a Brown’s jersey…those must be cheap on NFL.com The Dirty Bird dance was performed by everyone....even Term Paper. Large Mouth is a fast runner, but let me tell you......he is like Elaine from Seinfeld when it comes to dancing: Large Mouth's Dirty Bird dance was severely uncoordinated! The "Hail to Brady" exercise was deflating. Two footballs were carried by various PAX throughout the workout; actually think Angry Elf carried a football for the entire workout. One of the Qs needs to remember to bring a watch There were some seriously slow 40 times after the 3rd effort (and before for that matter) As far as we could tell there were no fumbles during catch me if you can. YHC totally blew the counterama. sorry Hermes
