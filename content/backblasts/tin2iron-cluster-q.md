No Q to start the workout so YHC took control and called out the cluster Q format. Each HIM will think about 2 exercises and will lead it for the amount of reps they liked to reach. 5 HIMs braved the cold but it was glorious.

Ausfahrt made the call to grab pavers so we obliged.

YHC: Called a mosey around the pickle and we warmed up using the pavers, Alleluias, curls, and tricep extensions. Once around the pickle we circled up for some more warm-ups.

Punch Card called LBC and flutter kicks,

Ausfahrt called American Hammers and Homer to Marge

Pinto called paver flies and lawn mowers

PVC led us to the picnic tables for L/R Step-ups and Irking

We all called more table work.

Ausfahrt led us to the octagon for irking and high angle dips.

YHC directed everyone to the wall for People Chair. While 4 PC, the other did an exercise, repeato until all did it.

Headed back to the flag for Mary around the horn. Each HIM called out their favorite exercise.

COR: 5

NOR: Honor, Respects, and meh

NMS:

It was really cold but to be out there with those men was a great honor.
