YHC's birthday fell on a Friday this year so of course I was planning to Q the best AO in Carpex, on Friday, in North Cary. To my delight, Saban has the same birthday and the same plans. The Co-Q fix was in. 14 arrived, one was a FNG - 13 on time, Flip flop was late. Come on bro, as a future site-Q, you are going to have to tighten up. Tardys and absences by site Qs are unacceptable at DZ.

Warm-up: 20 SSH, 10 GM, 20 PJs, 20 Mtn climbers, 10 IW, and 38 hand release merkins.

Thang: To the shelter for 20 ALRSU, 20 irkins, 20 T-bags, 20 dips. Repeato

Run down the hill to the greenway stopping for 20 merkins, 20 dips and bearcrawl the bridge. Plank hold for the 6. Run all the way up the mountain to the shelter. Squat hold. When all arrive, 20 LBCs. Run around the pickle back to the flag.

Circled up to start the 2nd birthday celebration with 44 Side Straddle Hops, then partner up.

Theme was to honor some of the other greats born on January 26. Partner 1 would run a lap around the parking lot in honor of race car driver (and sometimes actor) Paul Newman, while Partner 2 did AMRAP exercise that was (at least loosely) inspired by another person who shared our birthday. The exercises were:

Burpees (in honor of Jose Mourinho, manager of Manchester United who are generally known for their diving and other dirty cheating tactics)

Star Jumps (in honor of Eddie Van Halen and Van Halen's 1984 hit "Jump")

Abe Vigodas (a little pause to honor Abe Vigoda, who died on January 26)

WWII Situps (in honor of Louis Zamperini, WWII veteran and POW - subject of Unbroken)

Sumo Squats (in honor of Road Warrior Hawk, member of the legendary Road Warriors tag team)

Mosey over to the basketball court for Australian Mountain Climbers (since today is also Australia Day)

Suicides (traditional ending to hockey practices just like the Great One, Wayne Gretzky).

Circle up and one more honor for Louis Zamperini (who survived 47 days adrift on the Pacific) with some Boat-Canoes

COT: count, name-o-rama, prayers and praises. Welcome FNG Cap'n Crunch.

Saban took us out.
