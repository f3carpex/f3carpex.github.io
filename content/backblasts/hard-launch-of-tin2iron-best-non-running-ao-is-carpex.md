I am so proud to announce the hard launch of this much needed non-running AO.

How this all became is I wanted to start an AO and partner with Ausfarht to lead it. I approached him with my proposal and he was all about committing to it. The planning took sometime because we wanted an AO that would accommodate any workout from boot camp to weights, etc. as long as there was no running. It’s a non-running AO but it will have limited run for those who want some running.

The thought was partner up with another AO so BH was the original thought but there was no toys / coupons for us there. Then it became obvious that we need to use Sovereign Grace Church because it is the home of Hell’s Bells (kettle bells) and Tortoises (cinder blocks). It also has picnic benches and pull-up bars. It was the only choice after that. The only issue is we did not want to mix it with a limited run.

We pitched the idea to Disco Duck and Pet Sounds in March with a tentative hard launch date in April and they liked the concept. We had Monday as the day but DD said we needed another Thursday workout so we took it. The date for the hard launch was April 10th.

Unfortunately, we were plagued with COVID-19 hitting our nation like a ton of bricks in March so we postponed the launch until this pandemic would pass. To this day, we are still experiencing this pandemic with restrictions. But we are able to work through it and make it happen.

We did 2 recon workouts (5/21 and 5/28) with 4 PAX on each day. Our soft launch on 6/4 had 8 PAX (Ausfarht, EarharT, Intimidator, Reentry, Side Out, Texas Ranger, Theismann, WWW) + 1 FNG Hipster.

For the hard launch, QIC / YHC had a workout in mind until yesterday when Parker DM’s me saying he is bringing the BH PAX to Tin2Iron to support the launch. #HIMOTY

I had to come up with a workout to accommodate the extra PAX so I thought about it and it came to me. Read on to know the outcome.

We did the F3 admin stuff, no FNG, and did our Pledge of Allegiance. We SLOW moseyed to the backside of the business building to take advantage of the double hill. You guessed it, QIC called out double 7s (hill 1 - burpees and flutter kicks; hill 2 - Catalina Wine Makers and LBCs) after warm-ups (GM with hamstring stretches and daisy pickers, Sir Fazio f/b, overhead claps and seal claps).

Parker + 13 BH PAX arrived and they blended right in to do double 7s. Once everyone was done, we did ABCs with a WWW and the BH PAX headed back to BH. I truly appreciated Parker for bringing them by to help launch our newest non-running AO.

The Tin2Iron PAX moseyed back to the flag to pick-up their paver coupons for a modified Colt 45 (curls, presses, and tricep extensions) x45 each exercise. We ended with PAX favorite Mary exercise around the circle. We ended on time with have a nice day.

COR: 10 solids and strong HIMs

NOR: Honor (2), Respect (7), Hate (1)

Announcements:
