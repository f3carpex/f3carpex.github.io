Last night during dinner I was explaining to my 2.0s what the workout for the next morning was going to be and why. As I read to them the heroic account of Micheal P Murphy and his ensuing death I became immediately convicted of why I called the Murph for a workout. While physically it is quite a challenge, my hope is as we endeavor to complete such a feat that we are taking a moment to remember the all the great men and women who risk their lives everyday in defense of the United States of America.

0515 and 8 HIM have showed in spite of the 48 degrees and light rain. With much work to do and not much time we skipped the pleasantries of a warm up and went straight to the heart of the workout.

Thang 1: The Murph - Run 1 mile, 100 Pull-ups, 200 Push-ups, 300 Squats, Run 1 mile

From the parking lot of BIB to Ritter Park the home of Slippery When Wet, via the greenway, is almost exactly one mile. Upon arrival we partnered up, for encouragement and spotting purposes only, to commence the Murph.

Shout out to WWW and Frisco who, even though they were Bruisers, fought hard to run the mile, get as much work in as they could and battle back to the flag in honor of Micheal Murphy.

With just nine minutes to spare all have finished and we depart for the flag.

COT: This was a rolling COT as we performed Count-o-rama, Name-o-rama, and announcements in the last quarter mile of our run back.

Announcements: There will be Pre-Murph to the Krispy Kreme Donut challenge coming up in early Feb 2nd.

Prayers: Continued prayers for Ausfart and Swag's M.

NMS: 3 Jan 2018 was my first Q and was at Tortoises under the tutelage Hermes. I am grateful for his encouragement to get me out in front of the Pax. As a group of self-led men we grow as individuals and as a group when we challenge ourselves and each other to Q. Leadership is only a philosophy unless it is executed.
