Well the theme of my recent Qs has been Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V ala Hoppin John, but y'all had to know THIS one was coming. [**Last year on 1/21**](https://f3carpex.com/2020/01/21/great-scott/), Blowout joined me at Claymore for the least-attended themed Q in F3 history, and we had one heck of a time. When I saw a limited run Q spot open on 1/21 this year... I knew it was time.

Gather up, no FNGs, scoop up a CMU, and here we go!

Warmup consisting of:  
**G**ood Mornings  
**I**mperial Walker  
**G**oofballs  
**A**nnie

Head over to the 55-side lot with your CMU and get a spot on the slight incline.

THANG 1  
Go back in time – Clock Merkins (10 each position 12-9-6-3-12)

  
welcome to the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance. the coupon is your partner  
7s with  
Crab Cakes  
Earth Angels  
mosey with your rock in between  
  
and to cap off the dance, the Johnny B. Goode:  
play Chuck Berry’s Johnny B. Goode while extending the coupon over your head.  
Do a coupon squat on every ‘go’  
Do a coupon burpee on every ‘Johnny B. Goode’

THANG 2:  
Forward in time – Clock Merkins (7 each position 12-3-6-9-12)  
Sticking with our 7s route, lunge walk back and forth stopping at each end for descending LBCs (20-15-10-5)  

THANG 3:  
Back in time once more – Clock Merkins (5 each position 12-9-6-3-12)  
In honor of the Indians that chase Marty at the beginning of BttF3 (and the bear that eats his boots) – indian run bear crawl from one end of the main lot to the other.  

Mary:  
  
**W**W2s  
**A**merican Hammers

THAT'S IT

I remember at the end of the workout last year thinking that as long as there was a decent chance of Blowout not showing up to a particular workout, that this would be an easy recycle. Not having a baseball field lost a key element, but hey we made it work.

3 seconds into the IRBC, it was pointed out that this was not an indian run at all. Real IRBC incoming at some point (spiritual predecessor to the Battle of Hoth).

Should we pencil this in for next year's MASH on 1/21 now?
