Water Wings Week began on a clear, cool morning at the infamous A-Team AO. This roughly marks my One Year Anniversary, but since I couldn't remember the actual date, I'm Qing the whole week for prudence sake.

18 brave HIMs met at the gate while watching Mr Parks and Rec unlock the gate 2 minutes too late for the PAX to drive into the park.

5:45 ticked and YHC lead the PAX to the 2nd parking lot on the right for a little warm-up with SSH, Cotton Pickers and Imperial Walkers.

We headed deeper in to the park in search of some non-traveling rocks. Partnering up, one partner did rock curls while the other ran ~100 meters to the stop sign and back. Alternating turns, we did overhead press, then overhead rock lunges twice while partner ran to stop sign and back. 4 cycles total.

The PAX headed further to the shelter for 2 sets of 15 dips, 15 alternating right/left step-ups and 10 derkins; all in cadence of course.

Returning to our rocks, one partner performed rock you body while other partner bear crawled across the parking lot and back. Rinse and repeat.

After returning our rocks, we rejoined on the basketball court for some Balls to the Wall hold until all PAX counted off to 5. Then a Burpee suicide with one burpee at half court and two burpees at opposite baseline. Balls to the Wall again for all PAX 5 count. Burpee suicide with two burpees at half court and four burpees at opposite baseline. Moseying back to the parking lot near the park exit, there was very little mumble chatter...

The PAX circled up for a little 5 way modified Jack Webb: 4 air press, 4 forward arm circles, 4 reverse arm circles, 4 overhead claps, 4 merkins. repeat with 8 reps of each exercise after which YHC decide his shoulders had enough and we jogged a lap around the parking lot.

Fortuitously there were about 8 minutes left and YHC did not want to freeze his six doing Mary, so we added a set of 11s, one end fast feet on parking curb and merkins on the other with only a short distance in between.

Mary consisted of 40 LBCs
