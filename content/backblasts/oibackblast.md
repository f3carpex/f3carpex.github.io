Saturday. July 28, 2018

76 degrees, overcast, thunder, lightening

7 Pax gathered in the parking lot at OIB Pier.   3 from CarPex (Burt, CD, Kitty), 1 from the Dash (W-S) (Palin), 1 FNG from Durham (Palin’s FIL; now Mr. White),  1 From PA (Mr Dice Kitty’s Dad....AKA Red Baron) and 1 from Raleigh (Salt Life).

Lightening.

We passed on the Beach and headed to the carport area under the cool Drift coffee shop.  Jog over to Drift.    We each ordered a latte and avacado toast and we were off.

Standard warm up.  SSH, Burt Jacks, Merkins, Mtn Climbers, Cotton Pickers (funny story from Palin), butt kickers, high knees, skippers, karaoke both ways.  Squats came with an Al Gore bolt on which is arms out like you are holding a tree.

Thang.   Dealers Choice Pyramid.  7 Pax each call a move and we do 5, 10,15, 10, 5.   About 10 yard jog between pyramids.    We did.  Diamond Merkins, burbees, dying cockroaches, jump lunges, squats, jump squats, planks.  Jog to the parking lot.  Prisoner runs and dips, irkins and squats.  Something like 3 or 4 rounds with some fellowship.

Roll back to the lot for some Kitty led Mary.   Freddy Merks, boat canoe,  some variation on Freddy’s...with a hold after three, LBCs and Half A Nice Day.

COT

names, prayers for those with addiction (namely Palins mom who is getting treatment) and praises by CD for the F3 love.

Burt took us out.

NMS

Here is what we learned:  FNG is a medicinal chemist PHD, does a bunch of research.  Welcome Mr White.   Palin lived in W-S  born in Juneau Alaska.  Best form I have ever seen for all moves this side of Nabs...who worked in the dash.   Red Baron is in great shape and is a beast.  No joke.   Also all Jodice men have a dice tattoo.  Red Baron’s has stars.  Shout out for his military service.  Salt Life is cool so glad we have connected down at OIB.  And great to hang with CD and Kitty.

Coffee at the Pier with the locals not at Drift with the beautiful people.

Later.  MIAGD TY4YL
