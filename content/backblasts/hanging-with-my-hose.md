# Hanging with my hose

This BB is bought to you courtesy of Carl Schreiber, 42, @Frisco

While planning the birthday Q for the best limited run workout AO in CARPEX, Mr. @Frisco DM'd me that he had some extra hoses hanging around.  Initially, YHC had concerns about taking him up on his offer to use his hoses but decided to take a chance.  Hey, it's my birthday Q, what could go wrong?

To my relief, it was discovered the extra hose were actually twelve (12) leftover fire hoses from the 9/11 stair climb.  Now we had something we could work with.  Ideas started to flow.  And, as one would suspect, there was ample mumble chatter making references to the hose coupons:

My hose is long enough That is what she said It takes two hands to handle my hose i got hose in different area codes

5:30am sharp, PAX circled around the flag for a Pledge of Allegiance.  After a quick giving of thanks for our ability to get out in the gloom, It was time to  hit a brisk run to loosen up.  Just when we circle up for warm ups, who decides to come rolling in hot?  Intimidator and Ezekiel.  Ten (10) penalty burpees, OYO.  Moving on....

YHC is very thankful for the ability to post with his F3 brothers many times a week.  YHC is so motivated by the likes of @Intimidator and @Term Paper who continue to post and post hard at the age of 57.  Super Respect to these two HIMs along with many other RESPECTS who represent F3 very well.  They are motivating others with their presence and work ethic.

YHC used a recycled play list from Hells Bells and as we moved, the speaker and iPhone moved with us.  Thanks @Theismann.  80's rock is such a good thing to work out to.
