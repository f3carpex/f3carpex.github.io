Shakin' Not Stirred was the first place YHC posted with F3, and it's always felt like home to me, so I was very excited to Q here for the first time.

**Warm-Up**

Mosey over to the community center parking lot and circle up for side straddle hops, merkins, plank jacks, imperial walkers and burpees (at this point YHC really was just trying to get warm).

**The Thang**

Mosey over to the shelter at the boat house to find that there were more PAX and less room than YHC expected.  But we improvised, we adapted, we overcame.  Move the tables around a little bit and get after it.

Derkins, alternating left right step ups, dips and squats x 20

Quick lap around the parking lot (we're not gonna run that much)

Derkins, alternating left right step ups, dips and squats x 15

Quick lap around the parking lot (seriously, we're not gonna run that much)

Derkins, alternating left right step ups, dips and squats x 20 (YHC suprised the PAX by going back up to 20 instead of down to 10)

Mosey back over to the kiosk for Jacob's Ladder, run up the hill, do four burpees, run back down the hill, repeato adding one burpee per trip until we get to ten.

Mosey over to the Billy run starting line for the Billy run back to the flag.

**Mary**

American Hammers, box cutters (thanks, Ma Bell), Homer to Marge (left left up), Homer to Marge (right leg up), boat-canoe (thanks, Banjo)

**COT**

**Count-a-rama**: 33 **Name-a-rama**: 6 RESPECTS, 27 mehs **Prayers / Praises**: Prayers for Saban's neighbor Jim who contines to battle cancer after thinking he had already beaten it, prayers for Hello Kitty's friend's son who is recovering from getting burned. **BOM**: YHC took us out

**NMS**

I first posted at Shakin' Not Stirred over two years ago.  There were four guys who made an impression on me that day.  I'd like to thank Saban for inviting me, Wonk for encouraging me, Burt for entertaining me, and Ma Bell for naming me.

Thanks also to the HIM who got up early just to follow me around in the dark and the cold this morning.  It's an honor to be out in the gloom with you.
