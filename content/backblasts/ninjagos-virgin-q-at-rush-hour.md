- **When:** December 18th, 2018
- **QIC:** Ninjago
- **The PAX:** Theismann, Ollie, Mojo, Dice, Kermit, Ninjago, Traffic Cone, FNG Roy, YHC Earhart

9 HIM show up for an afternoon of fun with Ninjago and his first ever Q!  He had his winkie in hand and even brought a schoolmate as an FNG.  Theismann came in hot (man traffic was bad in downtown Cary).  Ninjago call time and we had out in a mosey toward the parking deck and take a right into the field and circle up for:

## Warm Up

  
Good mornings

Cotton Pickers

SSH

Hillbillies

## The Thang

Done with warm-ups, Ninjago takes into the parking deck and up the stairs to the top and we circle up.  Q instructs us to partner-up for DORA, 100 merkins, 200 LBCs, 300 squats.  Up and down the PAX go until we roughly finish with some PAX picking up the 6. 

Next, we look down the parking lot and see a row of lightpoles.  What do we do with lightpoles Olie?  We do ascending burpees up to 5.  Q then instructs us to head into the other stairwell for the next round of pain.

On the stairs, Q instructs the PAX to perform various exercises on each landing, including jump squats, rail merkins (up and down the rail 5 times), and irkins.

Down with the stairs, the Q leads us out and over to the atrium for a round of 7s, 6 starjumps and 1 CDD, running up the front stairs and down the back stairs. 

We still have time so Q calls a pain clock, classic exercises of dips, irkins, dirkins, quick feet with the various steps and low walls.

Done with the clock we head back to the flag and circle up for:

## Mary

PAX-led Mary included

Dying cockroaches

LBCs

American Hammers

Homer-to-marge

Merkins

Supermans

Bell tolls 6:30 and time to finish.

## COT
