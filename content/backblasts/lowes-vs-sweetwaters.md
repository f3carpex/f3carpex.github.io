16 PAX, one FNG, disclaimer given privately, perfect weather and we are off.

Mosey to a very unsafe place to warm up (sorry Shutty)

SSH, Sir Fazios, Good Mornings, Seal Claps and Mountain Climbers

Head to newly opened Lowe’s Grocery stopping at each light pole for increasing merkins starting from 1 and getting to 10

Christen the parking lot with a 4-man double pickle Indigenous People Run (IPR). During each lap, one of the 4 will remain in place doing an exercise, until all 4 have taken their turn. LBCs first set followed by Monkey Humpers

Continue the IPR back to the school area where 10 cones have been strategically placed approximately 10 yards apart. Modified 11’s with Merkins and WWII’s.

IPR to the stairs leading down to the track for stairs and Hand Release Merkins

Final mosey to the BB courts for Mary, consisting of Low Slow Flutters, Hammers and H2M

I’ve always been one of the proponents of continuing to write back blasts, but I confess that I got slack for my last 3 Qs. With an FNG posting, I wanted to be sure and memorialize his first workout.

Welcome Puddin’ and hope to see you back out in the gloom

Per the norm, I do a poor job explaining new routines, but props to the PAX for eventually figuring them out

Clementine arrived about 20 seconds late and we tried to leave him but Doggy Paddle did what a good site Q should, and waited for him.

Lowe’s manager met us at coffeteria, concerned about almost running us over during our laps. We reassured him that all was good. He was appreciative of the business.

There may be a controversy “brewing” for Thursday morning and evening 2nd F – Lowe’s or Sweetwaters. Stay tuned

Always an honor and a privilege
