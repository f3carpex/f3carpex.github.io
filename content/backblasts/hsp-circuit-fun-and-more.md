Lucky 13 PAX showed up at Hunter Street Park on a beautiful 60-degree June morning for my first Q since milestone birthday week a few months ago.  We were all about to confirm that the 0.5-mile loop around this AO lends itself pretty well to a nice little running circuit with a few pain stations.  0545 approaches, none of the prolific mumblechatterers in attendance (probably at BO with Burt), quick check for FNGs (none), and a brief announcement that there will be no awkward partner exercises today... and off we go.

###### Warm-Up

Short jog to parking lot and circle up for:

- 21 SSH, IC
- 15 Windmills
- 15 IW, IC
- 15 Hillbillies, IC

###### Circuit

Run counter-clockwise around 0.5-mile path with 3 pain station stops:

1. Behind right field fence: 25 star jumps, 15 Shakiras on each side
2. Picnic tables: 25 dips, 25 dirkins
3. Drinking fountain at skate park: BTTW with 10 Australian push-ups, 5 Australian MCs on each leg

Upon return to parking lot, bear crawl around the island before starting the next loop

All PAX completed at least 2+ loops

###### Dessert

Baseball/Softball field gate is locked so:

- Backwards run to end of fence outside of field
- 10 burpees
- Plank walk to your left half way back to the dugout, then switch to the right

###### Mary

- Set of 11s - knee ups, dying cockroach
- 15 Chilcutt Peter Parkers
- 20 LBCs
- Have a nice day

###### Announcements

- Deadline is tomorrow (6/30) to sign up for the Durham Bulls game on 7/23
- CarPEX 1776 Patriot Games - 7/4 at 0630 - Field of Dreams

###### Prayers

- The families of Earhart's coworkers who both passed unexpectedly
- Grease Monkey's M getting some heart-related medical tests done
- The family of Panama whose uncle passed recently
- Continued prayers for Cheech's family and everyone involved
- Safe return of Napster's children from camp

YHC took us out.  As usual, it's an honor to start my day with you all.
