Don't google that...

It's raining, quite a bit, but the 3rd core principle is outside, rain or shine, heat or cold.

10 head out for a bootcamp and 1 for a mother ruck.

Warm-up:

- Leave the lot and head to the front of the school only to do warm-ups right next to the covered walk way. Thank you, Shutty.
- GM, Imperial Walkers, Sir Fazio, Phelps and Overhead clap

The Thang:

- Run around from the school back to and around the track for a moist mosey of merkins. Stopping along the way for 11 variations of merkins including:
- RegUlar, wide, diamond, peter parker, eskimo, copper head, control freak, partner derkin, bench erkin, off-set merkins and world's worst merkins.
- Good times.
- Mosey the pax back to the overhand for partner core and laps to wrap it up.

Mary: Done during the end of that Thang

COT: 11 and YHC took us out!
