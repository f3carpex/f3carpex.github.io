With the promise of possibly the first meaningful rain in a few months, I thought I should remind all of our newer guys that we workout whether it's hot or cold, rain or shine. I mean, you haven't lived until you've worked out in a driving rain or snowstorm. So I posted it on one of the dozens of GroupMe channels. And though it was just a little mist (welcome as it was) apparently that kept some folks at home - or at the gym. Or maybe they all went to Pet Sounds' Q over at FOD, I don't know.

Whatever. 12 hardy plow mules showed up to do some work. The boys like to cut it close at FWD. 2 of them were jogging up with 5 seconds to spare.

0545, let's go. Jog over to the back parking lot circle drive where they've strategically placed concrete balls to apparently keep terrorists from driving into the bathrooms. There's 12 of us and 16 balls, so grab one for the

Let's roll. "What about those Wacky Inflatable thingies?" Crap, oh yeah. Halt. Next exercise is the Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm Tube Man x 10 in cadence-ish. Callahan refused to do them. Booooooooooo Callahan. Boooooooooo!

Mary

Oofta and Joe Smith, lead us in some Mary exercises, a little warm-up for your upcoming AO launch on Friday. They called 2 or 3 exercises each. I can't remember what they were, but oh the humanity. YHC finished us up with Dying Cockroaches.

COT

**Count-a-rama**: 12 **Name-a-rama:** 3 RESPECTS, 9 mehs **Announcements**: Slippery When Wet launch this Friday at 0545 at Ritter Park; 9/4 Labor Day Carpex convergence at 0700 at Bond Park; 9/11 Stair Climb at 0515 at Carter-Finley **Prayers**: People of Houston and SW Texas; Blue n Out's daughter. **BOM**: YHC took us out

NMS

I almost forgot the Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm Tube Men. Thanks, Term Paper. Boys, don't tell me that didn't add some levity to your day.

Except for Callahan or apparently left his sense of humor at home. Booooooo, Callahan!

The warm-ups were full of comments like "where's the Good Mornings?" and "why can't we just do SSH?" And Goose wasn't even there! Honestly, people, think outside your boxes.

I threw you all a softball when I told you to grab a ball. Nothing? I know it's early, but really, nothing? Callahan?

So, back to the Oofta / Joe Smith called Mary exercises. It was like a pitcher who'd just pitched 8-1/3Â  innings of beautiful no-hit shutout baseball, only to bring in a couple of rookie relievers who gave up some hits. Fortunately, we had a big enough lead we still got the win. It was comedy gold there for a while though.

In all seriousness, Oofta and Joe Smith settled in and did great. And they are to be commended for being Freed to Lead and launching an AO on Friday. They will be awesome Site Qs!

Thanks for coming out in the rain/mist, for working hard, and for making YHC a better man.
