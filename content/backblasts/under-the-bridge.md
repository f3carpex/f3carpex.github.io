Thang 2

Pax was not in the mood for Burpees at home plate even though the infield was dry and mostly sand. East Cary crew getting a little soft and whined like they were straight outta Apex. Denali had brand new pair of shoes and wasn't having it. We finished before he was able to change out shoes.
