Little soupy out there this morning, little soupy. Four Bruisers joined the Bounty Hunters for the Pledge, then headed to the corner of the skate park with our kettle bell coupons.

**Warm-Up**

Circle up for imperial walkers, Sir Fazios, squats, merkins and mountain climbers.

**The Thang**

Start at the light pole on the corner, each PAX takes a turn calling the exercise of his choice, then continue around the skate park stopping at each light pole for more exercises. We did multiple kettle bell exercises, multiple Mary exercises, multiple types of merkins and a few others. We didn't make it all the way around the park because in the middle of our trek we joined the Bounty Hunters for some bear crawl sevens, which produced many piles of sweat.

**NMS**

Nice of Hi-Liter to pull us in for the bear crawl sevens, enjoyed the fellowship with our running brothers.

I like the everybody calls an exercise at each light pole format for smaller Bruiser workouts. It gets everyone involved, and it allows the Q to join in on the mumble chatter.

Thank you for letting me lead.
