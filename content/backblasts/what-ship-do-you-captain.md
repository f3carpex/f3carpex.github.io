The original Q had a last-minute conflict, so I grabbed the slot last night. It's arm day.

19 Pax showed up for a Back-in-Black with no announced Q. Carpex 1stF Q Hermes was in attendance and took note.

5:15 start. I'm running a Q School 101 session in October, so I led with the mission and core principles, even though I was in front of the all-star team. Nailed the principles; work to be done on the mission.

**F3's mission is to** **plant, grow and serve small workout groups for men for the invigoration of male community leadership**.

**The core principles: (1) free; (2) open to all men; (3) outside; (4) peer-led; (5) ends in COT.**

Moseyed to the big Koka Booth parking lot for the warm-up. Captain Kirk asked me, "What ship do _you_ captain?" 41 years in, and I'm still trying to figure that out, Kirk.

Moseyed to the rock pile. Each pax chose three rocks, one big and two handheld. I'd stashed my Bluetooth speaker here before the workout (I upgraded from the much-criticized shower speaker). I threw on some tunes (mostly rap, sorry Blue) and led a 30-minute string of workouts (mostly bicep/tricep), at one point involving a circulating kettlebell. Each pax's initial rock selection determined how effective this was, so mileage may have varied. Personally, I checked the box and was pleased.

Moseyed back to the flag. Mary. Time.
