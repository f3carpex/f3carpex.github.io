15 Pax including 4 FNG's for Explored a new area at Flirtin With Disaster. Gloves were donated to each of our 4 FNG's. Great work Oofta in bringing out all these FNGs! I think this might be tied for a common era FNG record. The Warmup: Jog to the office park across the Parkway, a little Karaoke and backwards running, plank holding and one-arm merkins along the way to keep us all together. Jog around the "parking deck" which it turns out is only about 15 parking spots under a shelter. Circle up for some warm up including Good Mornings, SSH, Hillbillies, Plank Jacks, Mtn Climbers, Merkins at random quantities.
