Our bros in Louisville put a call out to the Nation this week.  To post on Tuesday, wear black, and get a pax picture holding up Ace of Spades to show support for Double Down, who is starting his fight against cancer.

For me, it's cool to see his name is Double Down, which we probably all know is a betting strategy in Blackjack.  Cancer can be a game of blackjack sometimes.  You know the cards you were dealt but there's still the unknown of what the dealer has in store.  Now, you can sit back and just hope the dealer busts and not do anything.  OR you can say, HELL NO, I GOT THIS!  I will beat the dealer!  I won't just sit here and see what happens.  It's go time!  **HIT ME!**

You got this Double D!  We're right there with you cheering you on.

So to theme it out we worked with the ole number 21!

0530, hit the pax with the disclaimer and the pledge then we're off.
