- Many thanks for Saban on the time keeping help.  On time and wrapped up COT at 6:31.  Not too bad for a dude with ADD.
- Also thanks for Co-Site Q Biner as a tour guide to the field.    Biner is such a nice guy.
- Wolverine has to be the darkest AO in all of F3.
- Term Paper was temporarily renamed Turks and Paper or Term Caicos...you pick it.
- It’s cool that all of the Coffeeterias are taking off.    2nd F Co-Q’s are happy.   Survey did not predict this.

Good stuff leading and picking up some extra energy from the Dudes.   Solid Group this am and I was thrilled to be part of the squad.

Later,

Burt
