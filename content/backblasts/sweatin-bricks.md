A humble group of 8 HIM's gathered early for the EC with Jiggly arriving even earlier at 0445 for his first of two laps around the lake. We dodged many a toad along the way. Today YHC Q-subbed for Peeping Tom who remains on IR recovering from an unfortunate cycling accident. He and Greenbow smartly chose to Mall Walk this morning's workout while ten of us sweat with some bricks.

Keeping the entire workout within the confines of Harold D. Ritter Park, we began with the Vanilla Bayonne warm-up, followed by a few parking lot lengths of Bear Crawl, Lunge Walk and Crab Crawl to get us started.

Mosey to the dumpster, grab a Brick (concrete masonry unit to be precise) for a round of arms and chest, then a big lap up to the entrance, round the pickle and back. We did that about four times with lots of (almost) Rock Row/Curls, Overhead Press, Kettle Bell Swings, Squats and so on. It's more work than it sounds, based on the whining among the PAX.

Mosey to the playground for a quick round of pull-ups to satisfy Bluewater's craving, then an extended PAX-called Mary with five or six well played ab exercises (yes, some Heels to Heaven, Joe Smith Style, were completed this day). There was some controversy between technology-enable HIM's about how far we actually ran, but estimates seemed to range around 2.5 mi - not bad for staying in the park.

Prayers for my brother, who's struggling with some challenges in life, and to Joe Smith's 2.0, who broke a leg recently and is on the road to recovery. Thanks to Chipper for taking us out.

Appreciate the opportunity to lead this morning. Thanks to all and SYITG.
