Oofta and YHC were especially amped for Kryptonite today, because we were the lucky two who get to take the SiteQ responsibilities for the next...ummm, how long is it? Denali and Wonderbread conveniently left that part out.

The EC was on, because, well, who doesn't want to run with the Beige Bros before a 3 mile minimum high tempo workout. We rolled back in to the launch lot with maybe 12 seconds to spare, the PAX gathered, no FNGs, we said the pledge and off we went....

Oofta led us to a "new" well lit section of the large parking lot for warmups, including SSH, Merkins, plank jacks, mountain climbers, IWs and Hillbillys. The 3 mile minimum ain't gonna achieve itself, so we headed off to another office building parking lot for 7's (American Hammers and WWIIs)....off again to make the big Regency Pkwy loop traveling in a two line Indian run. At each left entrance, we stop to do 15 reps of merkins, then

wide merkins, then diamond merkins, then offset merkins left, then offset merkins right. Indian run to the 'building on the lake' for a good time sprint drill. Oofta and YHC are on time...just like we drew it up. Another trip halfway around the lake and back to the flag. A few Mary and have a nice day.

Announcements: Denali and Wonderbread are all I've known to represent Kryptonite since I began coming out to F3...big Hokas to fill. I was all in when Oofta floated the idea of he and I taking SiteQ.

Prayers/Praises: The broken world always needs prayers. Grease Monkey's friend is going through a challenging time in his marriage and another friend with a young son who is fighting cancer. Oofta took us out.

Thanks for coming out today, we are looking forward to this. In closing, HELP WANTED! - the Q Sheet is open.
