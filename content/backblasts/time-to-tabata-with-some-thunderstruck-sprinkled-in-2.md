QIC: WWW

AO: Rush Hour

PAX: Disco Duck, Quiver, Theismann, Traffic Cone, WWW

On my quest to Q once a week which is my personal leadership challenge, I want to ensure the routine is well developed and not so vanilla. I try to think of routines to push the PAX. Read on to see what I decided.

We mosey up to Mr. Paige's sculpture for some warm-up. Warm-ups: GM, calf stretch with merkins x10 between each calf stretch, Sir Fazio, seal claps, overhead claps, air presses.

We mosey to my truck to pick up a coupon and my game gear. Mosey over to the open parking lot to begin the thang.

Thang 1

Thunderstruck

Thang 2

Tabata stations of pain (5 stations) 1 PAX per station. Each station is 1 minute with a 15 sec relax period and you rotate from station to station until all stations are complete. After each round is complete, mosey around the pickle.

After the mosey, we circled up for PAX call favorite Mary exercise ... 2 rounds.

It was a pleasure to lead a great group of HIMs!

We made it through the workout without getting moist which was in the forecast.
