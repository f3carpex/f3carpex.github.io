**QIC: Build-a-Bear**

2 (BAB and Banjo) for early-morning EC. 10 for the ME.

Pledge, then warm-up in Koka Booth main lot (lots of chatter --> shaky counting from Pax).

**Thing 1**: Catch Me If You Can around Symphony Lake

**Thing 2**: Pearls On a Hilly String in the Largemouth-Triple-Nickel neighborhood .

Back to the flag (hit 3 miles) for Mary.

**COT** **Announcements**: Mabopane Golf Tourney, Raleigh 9/11 Stair Climb, Michelob Ultra.

BAB took us out.

**NMS**:

Midway through the hill work, Francois asked BAB if he could provide a _little_ more sunshine instead of just laying down brutal exercise after brutal exercise. BAB responded with a sarcastic Tony Robbins-style motivational speech that I wish I could have caught on video, then called lungewalks up the steepest hill.

9 for Coffeeteria at NYBD3.
