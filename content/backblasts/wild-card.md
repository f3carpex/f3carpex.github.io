It was a special morning at Danger Zone for YHC, with my long-time good buddy Hacksaw coming over from Raleigh to co-Q.

**Warm-Up** Start with a lap around the pickle (including the stem at the entrance) then circle up on the basketball court for good mornings, windmills and imperial walkers.

With the PAX properly warmed up Hacksaw tells them he knew YHC before I was known as Disco Duck, he knew me when it was Wild Bill Deese. Therefore anytime YHC yells "WILD CARD!" we do five burpees. Which we did to close out the warm-up.

**The Thang** Count off by 1's and 2's, 1's run the pickle (including the stem) while 2's alternate merkins and dying cock-a-roaches. Flapjack and repeato with dips and LBCs, derkins and WWII's, irkens and Freddy Mercs, and another round of merking and dying cock-a-roaches.

Mosey to the soccer field rock pile and grab an ego rock and circle up for curls, extensions, presses, rows and squats, rotating after each exercise so that everyone gets to experience different sized egos.

Leave the rocks and cross the field, alternating between bear crawls and jogs.

Repeato with the rocks, then place them back where we found them and sprint back to the flag.

**Mary** Circle up for like a million American hammers, then Have A Nice Day.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  20 **Name-a-rama**:  6 RESPECT, 13 meh, 1 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Continued prayers for Ausfhart and Azul, and praises for the progress they've already made, prayers for Liverpool and his family with Hunter's birthday this weekend. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS** Even with all those Mumble Chatter All-Stars, Hacksaw was unshaken.

I completely enjoyed the Wild Card option, thanks to Banjo, Burt and Frisco for encouraging me to use it.

Trike's ten count is a work of art, one through six is like a melody, then seven is like a bolt of lightning.

Welcome FNG Mikey. Last name is Poe, we almost named him the Raven, but he liked it, so we went with Mikey from the old cereal commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYEXzx-TINc

YHC has been friends with Hacksaw since we were a couple of Hates with no wives, no kids and no clue. I only called him by his hospital name once, I think that's pretty good.

We had a great good of men this morning, thanks for letting us lead.
