Feeling like the ankle is getting back to full speed, and with the Thanksgiving convergence coming up, YHC knew he needed to shake a little bootcamp beatdown rust off. There is no finer AO on a Monday morning at 0530 on Davis Drive than Wolverine, for said beatdown.

Oh, but first HIM of all HIMs Build-a-Bear called a 0455 EC run and YHC felt obliged to join. Grizzly Bear Ollie was there to boot and it was a wonderful 3 mile loop.

Back to the lot as 23 men emerged, and here's what went down...

**Warm-up:**

- Run over to the far lot for GM, SSH, Arm Circles and Overhead Claps
- Get some curb for quick feet, merkins and dips... what's that Liverpool you think these little baby curb dips are funny? Cool, we'll do like 30 of 'em. Apparently he's now in peak physical shape thanks to F3, and as we now know, _**LIVERPOOL LOVES DIPS**_.
- We roll through that routine three times.

**Thangs:**

- Get a partner for Dora 1-2-3 (100 merkins, 200 squats, 300 lbc), but instead of splitting up do all reps with your partner and run the big track. Strong work men, put some mileage in on that alone.
- After the Dora it's back to the curb for 3 more sets including the invention of the Flanders (Hi-Liter will need to submit to the exicon), it's a curb dip into a homer to marge. Solid.
- Up and onto the street side walk to run back... a set of monkey humpers to keep the traffic honest half way back.
- At the lot it's a all you got around the pickle.

**Mary(ish):**

- 5 merkins
- Dying cockroach
- 10 merkins
- Hello Dolly... or was it Kitty?
- 15 merkins
- Some crap Hi-Liter called, it sucked
- 20 merkins
- Freddy Merks
- 10 merkins
- Boat Canoe
- Have a nice day... oh wait... 4 Wolverines in honor of the site... and we're done

Announcements were announced and prayers were prayed, lifting up Marshall and his family, specifically.

YHC took us out, as it is always my honor to do so! MIAGD!
