**Workout Date:** 04/28/21  
YHC needed to hop back on the Q train to get my momentum back. Tortoises was the second workout I was able to find on the Carpex Q sheet for this week. At Hell's Bells on Monday, I had heard about the pull up bars on site and hoped I could work them in somehow.

**Warm Up:**  
Give the mission statement, check for FNGs, give the disclaimer, and warm up:  
Side Straddle Hop x20 In Cadence (IC)  
Good Morning x10 IC  
Imperial Walker x20 IC  
Sir Fazio Arm Circles x10 IC Forward x10 IC Reverse  
Monkey Humpers x10 IC  
Standard Merkins x10 On My Down (OMD)  
Mountain Climbers x10 IC  
Downward Dog with calf isolation stretches  
World’s Greatest Stretch

**Main Event**  
**1)** **Rack Em Stack Em** in the parking lot. **Merkins** x10, **Squats** x20, **Carolina Dry Docks** x30, **Reverse Lunge** x40. Run to corner one for merkins, then back to start. Run back to corner 1 for merkins, then corner 2 for squats then back to corner one for merkins, then back to start, etc.  
**2)** Mosey to pull up bars and split into groups of three for **Pendulum**. Group 1 starts AMRAP **pull ups**. 2 and 3 run out into field to pick a point for Group 2 to start AMRAP **Imperial Squat Walkers**. Group 3 moseys back to relieve Group 1, Group 1 moseys to relieve Group 2, and so on. Repeat until all three groups have done five sets of both exercises.  
**3) Bat Wings**

Great group of fellows at Tortoises.  
The Cornerstone AOs have so many toys.  
I was glad to be able to incorporate the pull up bars this morning. I wasn't initially sure how I would do it with three bars and 8 PAX, but the Pendulum worked well. That's an exercise format I haven't called in quite some time.  
Onsite coffeeteria is a big win!  
This was my thirty-second #F3Q21 #2021Challenge Q. Next Q is tomorrow at Tin2Iron right here at Cornerstone in Carpex.
