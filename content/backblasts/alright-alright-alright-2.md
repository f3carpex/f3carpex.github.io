Without a doubt, that's the phrase that comes to mind when I think of Dazed and Confused. However, the PAX were none of that - they came raring to go!  
  
We had some great mumblechatter in the parking lot beforehand in throughout and it was great to have a couple new and relatively new to F3 PAX.  
  
Here's what went down;  
We started with the disclaimer, but also planted a seed for safety (to be revisited at COT). After the pledge to Old Glory, we moseyed past the school to the area in front of the parting deck for the CoP warmup. (SSH, Sir Fazios in both directions, Seal Claps, and Peter Parkers).  
  
From there we moved to the lower parking and set up to attack each corner. With a group favorable for fellowship, we were all able to work our way around together.  
Corner 1) Carolina Dry Docks, 2) WW Merkins (most believed that the merkin challenge was met here), 3) Star Jumps, and for 4) we took advantage of the incline next to the parking deck - a long bear crawl up followed by lunge walk down. Mumblechatter was more like a low grumble on the crawl, but picked back up nicely on the way down.  
  
A mosey to the tennis courts followed and PAX held balls-to-the-wall followed by wall sits through each PAX times 10 along the fence. The Joker kindly reminded YHC of my turn.  
  
When we moseyed right back to the hill, I perceived the PAX to be a little uneasy, but we weren't done yet. They stepped up to a solid pace during a Jacob's ladder with progressing burpees on top of the hill.  
  
Before getting back to the flag - a quick pitstop for some dips at the benches/bars.  
  
Mary included mostly standard core work (DC, HD, BC, HtM, LBCs, A-Rods) along with some windshield wipers. We started working in a couple of PAX before our final exercise - H.A.N.D.  
  
COT included our standard announcements, but a revisit back to the safety topic. Safety doesn't stop and we were reminded to look out for our brothers and to pass on observations to each other and/or site Qs. Some good feedback was volunteered from our morning and in general. Sharing observations is powerful and we agreed DAC is a pretty safe AO. Prayers for safe travels for all those travelling for upcoming vacations, etc.
