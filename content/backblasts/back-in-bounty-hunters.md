**Prologue**:

- A couple months ago, the Bounty Hunters shirt went up for sale. I'm both a Star Wars and F3 nerd, so I was all in, but I felt like I shouldn't wear the shirt of a Carpex AO where I'd never posted.
- Since I'm solo Site-Qing at Back in Black right now, I needed a flag at Koka Booth, so that I could head to Bounty Hunters and check that box.
- I reached out to Imp and Rooney to see if they'd be up for making the switch, and they were game. This was a _quiet_ week on the Q sheet, so I thought the Site-Q-bait-and-switch might liven things up.
- I'd never been to Hunter Street Park before, so last weekend, I brought my two youngest kids to walk it with me. It was 95 degrees and they self-destructed after exactly three minutes. I learned nothing.

**This morning**

Big crowd gathered by 5:30. EC runners are back. I get the flag posted, break the bad news that I'd be Qing today, and off we go.

**Warm-Up**

Mosey to town hall for the warm-up. Today was the day I was going to start a movement to switch "Good Mornings" to 3-count down/3-count up, like South Wake does it. But I was so focused on that announcement that I called them "Have a Nice Days." This was all a disaster. Onward.

**Thing 1: Silent Pearls On a String Mosey**

Ask the Pax to stay quiet because we're moseying through a dense townhome community. I didn't want to get Bounty Hunters banned from Apex the one week Imp and Rooney aren't there.

During the Hill Climb Challenge, I did the "Carriage Ridge to Peakway" route a few times. I remembered there was a pretty solid hill at the end. It's BRR season, so that was our destination this morning.

**Thing 2: Greenway 7s**

7s on the greenway hill, followed by a mosey downhill to the fork in the trail and an Indian run back up to Peakway. Mosey back through the neighborhood (a little less quiet this time, my bad on that). Monkey humpers to appreciate the sunrise. Back to the parking lot for Mary. Cross the 3-mile mark on the way.

**COT**

Announcements: golf tournament upcoming. Prayers for Alan's recovery and all affected by accident on I-87. I take us out.

**NMS**

I know this was a little self-indulgent, but July 20 Week isn't exactly F3 primetime, so I thought the Site Q Switch would be kind of fun. If you found it annoying, it was my fault, not Imp/Rooney's.

I starskied for coffee at NYB3. I was _not_ met as a returning hero (to put it mildly). It sounds like the Sharknado was every bit as punishing as you'd expect. I'm sorry I missed it!

What a great crew at BH. You've got runners, Carpex Legends, nantans, families, and Prodigal/Honeycomb setting the pace. I enjoyed being out there with you guys.

Kotters to fan-favorite Shank.

Next week, Kermit has your hijinx-free BH Q.
