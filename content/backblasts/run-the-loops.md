YHC pulled into the site of FMJ with a little bit of extra time to think about the route and routine I had planned out. The morning was nice, quite, and chilly (which its still winter, so thats not surprising). The only thing a little out of the ordinary was the bobcat and other construction materials in our parking lot, which they may have been there before then I don’t know. Perhaps they were working on the street lights around the school. If not I’d have to ask why, because they should have been.

In any case I didn’t have time to ponder all that because it was soon 5:30, the EC runners had come in, and it was time to start!

Ma Bell was off Q’ing FOD and thus the home flag was not there. Largemouth, however, had a backup flag. So we were able to recite the Pledge!

_**Warm Up:**_

After the pledge we ran a couple of laps around the main parking lot and then circled up for:

**Good Mornings**

**SSH**

**Windmills**

**Sir Fasio Arm Circles**

**Mtn. Climbers**

(We had to split the circle in the middle of the exercises for a brief second due to our favorite Kitty coming in hot).

_**The Thang:**_

When YHC Q’ed this site last year we failed to reach 3 miles, so I was determined not to let that happen again. This routine was very straightforward. Following the paved road, we ran laps around the entire school, pausing at three specific points for an exercise.

**Point #1 – 5 Burpees**

**Point #2 – 10 Jump Squats**

**Point #3 – 15 Merkins**

We kept running this routine till we had about 7-10 mins remaining.

_**Mary:**_

**LBC’s**

**WWIIs**

**Supermans**

**Piriformis Stretch**

**Hamstring Stretch**

**Bicep and Chest Stretch**

We then had to finish up with 10 penalty **Burpees** for Hello Kitty’s lateness!

**COT**
