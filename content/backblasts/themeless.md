~57 degrees and humid in early December.  11 PAX showed up to enjoy an unseasonably warm morning in the Carpex gloom.  My first Kryptonite Q since respect week of November 2017.  It's been too long.  Let's see if it's been worth the wait...

**Warm-Up**

- Circle up in parking lot
- 20 SSH, IC
- 15 Imperial Walkers, IC
- 20 Merkins
- 20 Mountain Climbers, IC

**Thang 1**

- Small group Indian Run to the parking lot entrance at top of the hill on Ederlee
- Plank until all in
- 20 Death Squats (Thanks, Largemouth)
- Continue across Ederlee to bottom of hill at Avenue of Estates

**Thang 2**

Hill repeats combined with rack 'em and stack 'em with the following exercises:

- 5 burpees
- 10 hand-release merkins
- Plank and plank jacks until all in
- 15 jump squats
- 20 dying cockroaches
- Squat hold and little man jumping jacks until all in

**Thang 3**

- Backwards run to Richelieu cul-de-sac
- Partner chase with 5 diamond merkins back across Ederlee and the long way around Regency Pkwy back to the flag

Things got a bit fractured and we almost lost one due to stomach issues. But we picked up the 6 and everyone was accounted for.

**Announcments**

**Prayers/Praises**

- None spoken but we all have something on our hearts and/or minds.  Remember how easy it is to make (or break) someone's day.

YHC took us out as best I could.  Always an honor to lead the men of Carpex.
