As the pax gathered, I was still driving to the AO, I'm assuming there was pleasant conversation had by all.  I popped out of my chariot and announced 1 minute, turned out closer to 15 seconds.  We are off on a warm up run to the fire station.  Warmups are a disaster, a car came, my cadence was apparently terrible, whatever, we did SSH/Merkins/Hill Billys/Good Mornings...on to the thang:

Ascending light pole B.L.I.M.P.S to the end of the road...

Start at first light pole and do 2 each of:  
 - Burpees  
 - Lunges (left/right is one)  
 - Imperial Walkers (left/right is one)  
 - Merkins  
 - Plank Jacks  
 - Squats  
  
Each subsequent light pole add 2 to each exercise. We got up to 10, then YHC realized maybe doing every other light pole might be wise.  
  
Ended at the dead end with one last set of 20, if my math is correct that is a total of 110 of each exercise.  
  
2 Lines of Indian run back to the bball court for a quick BTTW/Suicide then a mini broga session to finish.  
  
As always it's a pleasure to spend the early morning with this crew...till next time.
