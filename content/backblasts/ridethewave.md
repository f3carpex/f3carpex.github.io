2nd F event on Tuesday night prior to the Wednesday Q was bad idea.  Well the actual event wasn't a bad idea, but those last 4 Brooksweisers were prolly a really bad idea.  But hey, great opportunity for a 2nd F baseball game with your F3 brothers!  The mighty Holly Springs Salamanders, affectionately known by the locals as the 'Manders, are a force to be reckon with...sorta.  Anyhoo the plan was to carpool from some shady Cary bar called The 19th Hole Bar and Grill; leaving at 6:20.  Burt sent us a DM that he would be there at 6:00 to have a beer.  I got there at 6:15 and it appeared that @burtcarpex had been there for at least 2 hours----lots of empty Burtlites at his bar stool.  The only HIM there was @3dubs, so he piled all us up in his van and carted us out to Holly Springs.  Great game and fellowship, and WWW dropped us off.  That's when @burtcarpex and @brianjodice decided we should go back in the 19th Hole Bar and Grill.  Mind you, it was late (like past my bedtime), but I tagged along anyway.  We walk in and there is a dude at the bar.....the same dude that was there when we left for the game!  He was single handedly keeping the place in business (but was kinda sliding off his barstool and drooling in his fries)....no chance at all for an EH.  Anyway, Burt, Hello Kitty, and I had one more beer.  It was late.

Just a few short hours later, it's time to Q SNS.  I rolled in just in time at 5:44 a.m. and slurred through a disclaimer to an FNG that looked like he was ready to take on the world.  The PAX were already chattering way too much.  I had a headache.  Still laid a beatdown on the PAX tho.  It went like this:

**Warm-Ups**: Partner up with someone you perhaps don't know so well.  Get to know your fellow F3 brother during the warm-up jog, butt kickers, and side skippers. Circle up for these continued exercises, which were all performed in perfect cadence:  SSH, Sir Fazios forth and retro, GM, Phelps arm swings, Merkins, Wright Flyers, and Saturday Nite Stretch.

**Thangs**: 1.  Mosey to top paved hill across the street.  With your partner: Partner 1 runs to kiosk at bottom of hill for 10 Sumo Squat Jumps, then runs back up the hill.   Partner 2 is performing continued sets of x 10 each SSH, Merkins, Plank Jacks until Partner 1 returns.  Flip flop for 3 sets total.   Then x 20 Freddie Mercuries.

2.  Catch-Me-If-You-Can with x 5 Hand Release Merkins.  All the way to the rock pile at bottom of lake hill.

3.  Everyone get a rock that will further sculpt our already sculpted bodies. a.  Before rock exercises: x 20 Wright Flyers and a plank series, including chilcutts, chilcutt Shakiras, ,etc. b.  With rock x 15 in perfect cadence: RockRows, Curl4Gurls, OverHeadPress. -----leave rocks and mosey to the bottom of stairs at lake.

4.  Jacob's Ladder.  Burpee-Star Jump at top.  Up to reps of 5 at top.  A set of x 20 E2K to catch our breath.  Then one more rep of Jacob's Ladder all together.  Mosey back to rocks.

5.  Squat hold with rock for the SIX.  With rock x 15 in perfect cadence: RockRows, Curl4Gurls, OverHeadPress.  Return rocks neatly in their original spot (ChedderBo was watching).

6.  Double Applesauce from rock pile to the base of big hill at big field.  x 2o Dying Cockroach and x 20 E2K.  All in perfect cadence.

7.  **Ride-The-Wave**.  One big line of all PAX.  Traverse up and down the big hill from one end to the other.

8.  Mosey to Billy Line.  Billy run to Flag.  Circle up.  Burt called out a couple exercises to try to get a co-Q credit.

**COT Count-a-Rama:**  41 with SNS and Vespers **Name-a-Rama:**  A healthy mix of hates, mehs, and Respects.   And welcome FNG Prom King!  He is a 17 yo young man, who will be playing soccer at Gardner-Webb next year. **Announcements:**  July 4th CarPex convergence at Slippery When Wet.  @shutincarpex encouraged men to participate in 2nd F events "cuz we are cool to hang out with".   Thanks to Goose and Hello Kitty, there is a new CarPex Shovel Flag.....and it is _BadAss_!  Besides that Shovel Flag being at a lot of our events, Hello Kitty said the CarPex Shovel Flag's home will be with a deemed CarPex HIM on a rotating-type fashion.  HK did not go into deep detail on how one would earn the Flag, but "you'll know it when it happens". **Prayers/Praises:**  Water Wings newest addition yesterday.  Snots recovery (word on the CarPex street is that Snots ran ~2-3 miles the other day!) **Ball Of Man:**  Parker took us out like a pro.  Great words Parker!

**Nekkid Mole** **Skin: \*** I sweated out about 8 Brooksweisers this morning......only 3 more to go. \* Took a baseball glove and aluminum bat to the baseball game last night.....apparently you're not allowed to take bats into the venue.  The bat is in @3dubs van. \* There was a Saban-wanna-be by the name of McCants---he tried keep me on time----"we're not gonna make it back in time"; he was so worried! \* s/o to Bartman with the assist on all the names for the BB \* Ride The Wave looked cool a.f. !!!!!

Luv you guys, Flip Flop
