High, higher than Bond Park  
You know I like the dark  
I need you to elevate me here

At the corner of Norwell  
And North East Cary Parkway  
It's our premier AO, the first,  
The best, the one with all the sand

Don't be starting late  
I don't wanna be an object of hate  
Saban's watching the time  
The goal is elevation

Uncle, I think I've met you before  
Been calling you Buck more  
It's time, mosey out, Sosa grabs a light

Coney, Coney and YHC  
Leading on the mosey  
Skipping the pickle  
So hot, elevation

Cally, got up real early,  
He's acting kinda surly  
Nothing new, it's cool  
Maybe he could just try to smile once

Duck, is going for a walk  
Bringing Saban with him  
They don't like where we're going  
Going down, then up, elevation

Never been here before,  
There's a trail thar in those woods,  
It's dark, hope you brought a light  
Don't want you tripping on no roots now

Get to the bottom dripping sweat,  
It's hot, 78, and not yet six  
Explain the goal to all, it's simple, we're going  
Time to get some elevation

Ten squats now, then up,  
Try not to let legs stop,  
There's more, let's go, star jump at the top

Turn around, head down.  
Don't trip, don't stop or slow.  
At the bottom, pause, ten squats quick, then go  
E-le-va-tion

Repeats for 30 or so  
Each rep nets you 70'  
If you want to stop, that's cool  
Just drop three burpees and return

Want all this end?  
I do. You too. A few.  
That's all I got left.

Get back with 10 to spare  
Duck and Saban there.  
Circle up and see, it's time, for mary

Prayers for country, YHC's mom, Cally's grandma, Liverpool and many unspoken

Announcements: TCP registration & CSAUP

**NMS:**

- I think this was a record for elevation at DZ. I saw 528' on my Strava. Last year's Largemouth loop extravaganza netted ~500. They covered more distance though.
- Good times with Uncle, Cally, Coney and Sosa this morning
- Uncle tried to EH a dude by faking (we hope) a heartattack on one of the hills as a walker went by. The Good Samaritan offered assistance ... but also wisely kept on moving when he realized that we were doing this voluntarily
