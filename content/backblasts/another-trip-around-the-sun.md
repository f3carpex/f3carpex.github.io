13 optimistic HIM showed up in the gloomiest of glooms to ring out the old year in style. YHC was looking for a way to celebrate 2018 while looking into 2019 filled with hope. Being the 365th day of the year, a theme emerged. 365, you say? Could it be another Hi-Liter style burpee-fest?, the PAX wondered aloud. Read on to find out...

**Warmup**

After a quick tribute to our nation 'round Old Glory, we moseyed to the basketball courts. Circle up for some warmups:

- SSH x 18
- Imperial Walkers x 18
- Good mornings 3ct. x 6 = 18

**The Thang** - Around the Sun: after a spry mosey 'round the path to the far parking lot, we started a monthly tribute to 2018

- Merkins x 31
- Boat/Canoe x 28
- One-legged 80/20 squats x 31

Do you see a pattern? Jog the far side of the path back to the basketball court

- Merkins x 30
- WW2's x 31
- Prisoner squats x 30

Still looking for that pattern? Hi-Liter suggested the knuckle trick to count your months

- Merkins x 31
- American hammers x 31
- Squat jumps x 30

Seriously, haven't figured it out yet. Here's a hint...next up is October...and in honor of "Proctober" we mixed up the order a bit:

- Monkey Humpers x 31
- LBCs x 30
- Burpees, OYO x 31 - HAPPY NEW YEAR!

Wow, that went a lot faster than YHC anticipated, still a good 10 minutes to go...

- Mosey to the far side of the pickle, sprint up the hill and back around x4
- All you got sprint, 10 merkins, 10 American Hammers, 10 squats - GO!

Circle up for an impromptu Freed to Lead circle of Mary - started as a plank hold count-a-rama until Build-A-Bear challenged us to do the number of Merkins as your count. Which morped into PAX led Mary for the second time around the circle.

**COT**

**ANNOUNCEMENTS:** New Year's Day convergence, FOD - 6AM EC Run; 7AM Bootcamp; 8AM 2ndF potluck; Krispy Kreme Challenge
