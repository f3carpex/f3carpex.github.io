My 3 years of f3 celebration continue as I Q at the place I posted for the 2nd time, and my favorite Carpex AO, Bradfords Ordinary. What I remember from that post was that Disco Duck was the Q and the old lady that gave Callahan what was walking and carrying a bag of rice as he was coming off of IR a hard time. (Read about it [here](https://f3carpex.com/2018/05/17/tighten-up/))

**FNGs:** 2 Welcome Satchmo and Flavortown  
**EC:** Lots

Mosey to the best warm-up location the circle in front of the bank.  
**Warm Up:** 15 SSH, 12 Daisy Pickers, 10 Sir Fazio forward and backward, 15 Imperial Walkers, 15 Hillbillys, 10 Good Mornings ( the south wake way) During warmups the large F3 Mud Gear tank I bought specifically for TTT and had only worn once before revealed it was a little short. Thanks to Burt for the solidarity with the half shirt.

  
**The Workout:** After the belly show we mosey the rock pile picked up some rocks and headed to the church parking lot.  
**Thang 1:** Rock Tabata game. 30 secs on 10-sec rest. 3 Exercises. Curls for Gurls, Triceps Extensions, Squats. Add a rep if you are finished with the 3 before the 30 secs run out. Take away if you do not finish. We started at 4 but should have started at 8. 
Mosey’d to the lower entrance of the parking deck.  
**Thang 2:** Mosey to where the library used to be when I worked out at BO For a Dora 123. 100 Step-ups, 200 Dips, 300 LBC's

With 33 pax with us, I moved us to the flag with about 8 mins to go to the end of the workout.  
**Mary**: Freddie Mercuries Homer to Marge Have a Nice Day  
**Announcements**: TCP Sawgrass this Sunday at 2 pm. Tangs Going away Q/Party at Ragnorok.  
**Prayer**: MA Bell, Israel, and Palestine conflict and India’s covid issues.  
**TClaps:** 39 Pax showing up, was quite the sight. "It was a day" to quote Hello Kitty.  
**NMS:** The mumble chatter was off the charts and I was laughing a lot. Had to remember to keep the cadence going and the rest would work it out. 3 years since my second post and so much has changed, moved, in way better shape, both myself and my marriage. Being around men who are all pushing each other to be better men has been a blessing for me in many ways. When times have been rough the men of F3, both Carpex and Southwake, never fail to show that it is more than a workout. The last stop on the 3-year tours is SWW, see you tomorrow!
