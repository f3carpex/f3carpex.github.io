19 PAX, including some strong mother-ruckers, gathered round the flag at Green Hope Elementary in search of their morning Fs. It was a chatty group, so while the ruckers headed off on their journey, the rest of us moseyed around the trail to the other side of the big athletic field. But first, Hi-Liter met the challenge of reciting the mission of F3. The disclaimer was referenced, and allegiance was pledged.

### Warm up

Mosey around the field, find a spot the sprinklers aren't sprinkling. A few SSHs, Good Mornings, Plank Jacks, Standard Merkins, Runner's Stretch, Steve Earles and Moroccan Night Clubs.

### The Thang

7s around the fields. One one side, World's Worst Merkins. On the other side, burpees. LBCs as the 6 complete their final lap, then mosey back to the flag.

### Mary

PAX choice of various Mary exercises, stopping just short of Hi-Liter who wanted to call the infamous Side Star Crunches.

### COT

- 5 respects, 14 mehs
- Skipper has a big job interview Monday, Hi-Liter will be traveling to complete his Doctorate requirements, and continue to remember Disco Duck and his M after the loss of her father. YHC took us out.

### NMS

- The loop around the fields is a nearly perfect 0.5 miles
- Everyone ran the same way around the loop doing 7s. YHC was a little surprised by that
- This is definitely a nice spot for EC pull-ups. Biner supplied the music, which was not grunge.
- Skipper learned how to pronounce Fuquay
- Later during COT, there was a lesson in the correct pronunciation of Angier
- Post workout note - Excellent Starsky example by none other than the Carpex Nan'tan
- MIAGD boys! Be a little better today than you were yesterday
