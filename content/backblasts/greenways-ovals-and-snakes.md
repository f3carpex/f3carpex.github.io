Lion's Den! Only my second post there, but man is that a nice site. Just wish it wasn't a 40 minute round trip drive to get there. Ne'ertheless, here we go!

FNG check (one!), even numbers check (yes!), <16 people check (also yes!), clunky disclaimer, LET'S ROLL.

Mosey around the lot for Carioca both ways, backwards and forwards run, then continue the mosey to the north lot for GM / IW / SSH / CP / SM / PJ / MC. Follow me offsite!

Upon arriving halfway down a short segment of the Beaver Creek Greenway, partner up. Partners run in opposite directions, do 10 standard merkins at the end, run back to meet your partner for 10 partner clap merkins. Do 3 sets of that and recover to the end of the greenway where we entered. Then for a lunge-walk/LBC, nay regular run/LBC, vs Bearcrawl catch me if you can to the end of the segment. Recover to catch the leads, and follow me back through town to the Scotts Mill Green.

Partner 1 runs the ovular path, and Partner 2 does alternating Derkins and Dips. Flip Flop Repeato, then American Hammers for recovery. Follow me back to StMM.

Upon arriving at the edge of the first lot, do two sets of Serpentine Sprints (50% up/mosey down/75% up/mosey down/100% up) with some recovery Erkins in between.

Back to the flag for Mary consisting of BC / FM / WW2SU / LBC / HAND THAT'S IT

I had an idea of where I wanted to go, but it was 100% dependent on how many people showed. This was the perfect number - 16 was the max i had in my head. The greenway is SUPER residential, so anything above 16 posed the risk of being unruly... and forcing an audible.  
  
First of 2.5 Qs this week - come out to DP Friday for some more!! Appreciate you all working with me today.
