Slippery When Wet - home of the EC run as well as where YHC completed week 1 of the 2019 IronPax Challenge. In celebration of how much that sucked the first time, we're gonna do it again today. Several PAX did some kind of EC run, 2 PAX for EC pull-ups. At 0545, there were 15 gathered round the flag. First exercise, Pledge of Allegiance.

## Warm Up

2 laps around the pickle with some high knees and karaoke. Circle up for a fairly standard warm up consisting of SSHs, Moroccan Night Clubs, Seal claps, Steve Earles, Plank Jacks and Control Freak Merkins

## The Thang

Starting at one end of the parking lot, broad jump 2 spaces. Then complete:

- 10 burpees
- 10 Bonnie Blairs (count each leg)
- 10 Big Boi situps (WWIIs)

Repeat this sequence 2 more times, then bear crawl back to where you started. That is one round, complete a total of 5 rounds. Today, we all go until the first person completes 5 rounds. Take a quick recovery mosey then back to the flag.

## Mary

Varying counts of LBCs, American Hammers, Dying Cockroaches, Homer2Marge, and 2 Side Plank Star Crunches each side. Have a Nice Day

## COT

Remember the KKC - Feb 1 and a pre-Murph at 0630 @ Pullen. Prayers for Greenbow's family - his Aunt recently passed, and an Uncle just had a stroke. Continue prayers for Kingsley - has been hospitalized for an infection to go along with NHL chemo treatment. YHC took us out.

## NMS

- The reason for the random number of reps during Mary was so PAX could not anticipate when we were going to finish. No Hi-Liter, it was no more complicated than that. Mind games, if you will.
- Following today's workout, the site Qs at SWW have instituted a new policy - all workouts must be submitted ahead of time for approval
- MIAGD - be a little better than you were yesterday!
