Pulled into the parking lot and Hermes and High Heels were already there at 5:20am. High Heels was visiting from Knoxville and it was nice to have him. We then got to here a story about Khakis knocking a guy out in college and how it changed his life! Pretty interesting stuff but then we were late so we were off....
