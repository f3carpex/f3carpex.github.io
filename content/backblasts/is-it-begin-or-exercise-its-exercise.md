So a little less than 5 Months ago in May, an overweight, really out of shape FNG wandered up to Rush Hour. I was welcomed warmly by Old Maid and Disco Duck, and Riptide showed up to lead the Pax at 17:45. We went to the parking deck and ran the stairs with pain sticks and baked on the top deck of the parking deck.  Now I am less overweight and less out of shape so in honor of that work out we would not be going to the parking deck or getting close to pain sticks...

**Prayers and Praises:** Aristocrats recovery from labor last week. Continued prayers for the People Down east.  YHC took us out.

**NMS:** As I said above, and continuing the trend of VQ'ing at your first workout. Almost 5 months ago I walked up to Rush Hour, and F3 has done exactly what Is says, never left me behind, and has not left me the same. I still have a ways to go to get into shape both physically and mentally. I am proud to be part of F3 I even wore my F3 Carpex Shirt when we where in Disney World Last week. YHC made a few mistakes here and there but I knew that I would be picked up by the pax, so that made this a lot easier. Of course, I am sure you all were being a little easy on me... YHC will expect more ribbing for those mistakes next time I Q for sure. I has been an honor to work out with you, and an Honor to lead you today.
