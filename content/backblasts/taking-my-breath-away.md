On the 4th day, Breathtaker and I decided to Q Flying Circus.  Its been on my TO-DO list for awhile.

Forecast? Copious amounts of rain. Head for cover?  Heck no...

Roll up on the AO with five minutes to spare.  Not one around... uh-oh.  Luckily Biner keeps a spare shovel flag in his SUV as no site Qs were present.  Though I did get a drunken text from 1AM SkyBlue apologizing that he was "working" late.  Not sure if I was the intended recipient or not.

Anyways... it was perfectly gloomy and headlights started rolling in.

Avoid MaBell if he's eaten tacos the night before.

Need a sports bra when wearing BreathTaker.  Loose and very top heavy.  Maybe rename it Pamela ?
