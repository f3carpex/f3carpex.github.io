YHC always try and start his BB listing the number of Pax.  It seems the past few Qs that's been a feat of its own.  We had 21 when we left the flag.  We had 20 when we got back and we had 21 again when we got to our cars.

Let the Q explain (and tell ya what we did!)

**0530:**  Intro and Disclaimer (there was an applause of sorts even.)

**Warmup**:  Head for the business park, crossing the busy road under the lights.  Watch out for Flo sticks everywhere...  Warmup was YHC's Signature Sauce  (Good Mornings, Hill Billy, Merkins, SSHs)

## Thang 1:  5-5-5s

- 5 reps, 5 times, 5 exercises
    - 1.  **5 Merkins**, up the stairs, **5 merkins**, down the stairs, **5 merkins**, up the stairs, **5 merkins**, down the stairs **5 merkins**.
    - 2\. **5 Monkey Humpers**, same pattern
    - 3\. **5 Overhead claps**
    - 4\. **5 Burpees**
    - 5\. **5 Diamond Merkins**  

## Thang 2:  Jumping Ladder

- We ran to a new parking lot at a church heading towards Waverly Place.  YHC didn't know how we'd get miles in so this was the strategy.  Just go to a parking lot far away...
- Broad Jump 1 parking spot, run to end, do 1 merkin
- Broad Jump 2 parking spots, run to end, do 2 merkins
- ...
- Broad Jump 7 parking spots, run to end, do 7 merkins
- And we're out of time and breath.

That about sums it up!

### NMS

- OK so for starts Frisco fartsacked.  He pulled a YHC move and over chatted it up on Slack and then sacked it.  A classic from the Shut-In playbook, tclaps.
- Red Lobster made it!  On time!  His 5th week out so TCLAP to you for still going strong brother!
- Sparky you were pushing it today man, keep doing it!
- Lots of mumblechatter...which was expected.  Music to my ears.
- Fun fact:  YHC had a 3rd Thang planned that is similar to a Whiplash signature move but Google Streetview let me down.  It's coming though, don't worry...
- It's getting too dark out already.  Not happy about it.  It's like Wolverine summers right now.
- OK so at some point we lost Texas Ranger due to work.  He EC'd so he could leave early, well played.
- Then we get back to COT and we have 20 (and then +1 Texas for 21.)
- THEN YHC takes us out and we walk to the cars only to find Khakis running in!?!!!
- He was going to be late for FMJ so he decided he'd just do FWD.
- Uh that don't play no more... 0530 here too buddy.
- Last time he pulled that move he won the Halloween contest though so he's still a champ in my book!!
