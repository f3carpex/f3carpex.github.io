Early arrival only to find upper lot gate still closed at 515am, so headed to main lot to hang out. DD loitering so he can use the public restroom, but that is locked too. Other pax arriving and Cheddar Bo finally gets his act in gear about 5:20.

Challenge was put out to have at least 1.5 boxes of kids bandaids for each pax present. If we didn’t reach the goal, the entire workout was going to be done listening to Air Supply. With 19 showing up, the 35 boxes were enough to spare us. We still get to listen to them pre-workout and for Mary. The great thing about listening to Air Supply is that their songs age very well. They are just as bad as now as they were originally.

YHC was definitely nervous to Q a KB workout after only posting there twice. It went ok, but sounds like it was too much running for some. If we had enough Kettle Bells, my plan was that the running would be walking a smaller loop with bell held overhead.

Hope you guys enjoyed the music.

Looking forward to next my post at HB, where I can learn a little more leading a workout.  I have my eye on a 5 lb bell.

Always an honor and a privilege.
