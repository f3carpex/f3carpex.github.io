In the summer of 1993, YHC and his M had just graduated with our respective Bachelor's degrees from The Dub (UNCW). My dad was a building contractor with a small crew of 2 men, and had just signed a contract to build a house. I was in need of gainful employment over the summer before starting grad school at UNC. So the M and I spent 12 somewhat awkward weeks in the summer of '93 living with my parents and spending some weekends at our freshly rented apartment in Chapel Hill. Why do I tell this story? The summer of '93 was a hot one. So hot, we modified our work schedule to start the day at 0600 and knock off around 1430. When it's hot, construction crews tend to start their day early.

2 PAX for an EC run on the greenway to the Kelly Road Park pullup bars, then mosey and meet up with 14 other PAX at Olive Chapel Elementary. Shut-In has his own reserved parking space.

Pledge of Allegiance, F3 Mission and disclaimer, then mosey to keep an eye on Shutty's car for...

### Warm UP

SSHs, Moroccan Night Clubs, Seal Claps (you're welcome Liverpool), Good Mornings, Runner's stretch.

### The Thangs

Form 2 lines and Cluster Indian Run to the sidewalk adjacent Kelly Road. Continue mosey to the intersection with Olive Chapel. There we see the do not walk sign, and since YHC hates standing around, calls 10 merkins. As soon as we hit starting position, the walk sign appears, so RECOVER. This was a popular move. Continue across OCR to the sidewalk adjacent the Publix Pointe shopping center. This is a beautiful stretch that is perfect for double 7s. Except the sidewalk is blocked at one point, which the PAX point out quickly and loudly. This is where the infamous "Don't be bitches" is heard. I think maybe Sour Mash said it. Anyway, we still call Double 7s but decide against heading back up the hill on the other side, as such a move would require 5 yards of travel on Kelly Road. Safety first, right? One one side, Break Dance Merkins. On the other side, Steve Earles. At the bottom of the hill at the entrance near Glory Days Grille (which is quite mediocre, btw), we do ascending burpees up to 6 then back down the ladder. It's somewhere in the middle of this that we realize the construction crews are getting started early, hence the traffic. The PAX have a few moments of the waiting game at crosswalks.

Once 7s are completed, we have time for an abbreviated Dora. 50 merkins/100 squats/150 LBCs for Partner 1. Partner 2 does an Apple Turnover up a stretch of sidewalk that conveniently heads toward F45. Did you know they are open now? It looked very air-conditiony in there. Someone said they heard yelling coming from there, but I don't believe it. This is where Shipper was seen taking his 0600 work call while doing LBCs.

Once complete, buzz the tower by F45 and cross the street one more time back to the flag. The game of Frogger is nearly complete.

### Mary

YHC calls American Hammers, then turns it over for PAX choice until 0615. YHC calls Have a Nice Day, which seemed to prompt Sour Mash and Theismann to talk loudly while the rest of us were trying to meditate on our day. Not having any of this, I call the 2 perpetrators to the middle of the circle and the 3 of us complete 10 burpees. YHC punished himself for a clear lack of leadership, while SM and T got their burpees for insubordination.

### COT

Some respects and mehs. Welcome FNG Flat Stanley. It really didn't matter what you said, you were going to be named this.

Announcements: Labor Day 5k/10k and Speed for Need, 9/11 Stair Climb

Prayers/Praises: Captain Kirk, Parker and his family, YHC thanks PAX for your prayers for clarity and for making me get my ass out of bed even when I don't want to. Praises for Liverpool's testimony and if you haven't listed to it, you need to. YHC took us out.

### NMS

Most of the NMS is throughout this BB. One thing left - be a light unto the world, and be a little bit better today than you were yesterday. And be safe out there boys.
