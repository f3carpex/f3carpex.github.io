I went to Q school a couple of weeks ago. Since I am out of town and will miss the start of VQ week I decided to step up early and get this thang done. In my posts leading up to this I took lots of mental notes. Most of them were forgotten before the first exercise (do you really have to say 'Recover'?).

Thanks to those who helped with time keeping as my FitBit bit it this morning.

- ECPs were performed. I know not the names nor numbers. Ask Theisman
- I was on the edge of Intimidation myself when HIM after HIM arrived in the gloom. 25 strong! Great showing!
- We started slowly as we mozied to side of church, circling up for

Mozy to hill

    - Boxcutters at top
    - Burpees at bottom
    - Bearcrawl Up the hill

Somewhere in the middle of these BBB's there was a suggestion to add a 4th B - Ballbusters. But I don't know if I can write that on a backblast.

Mozy around pickle back to flag

- Spartan with work worries
- Others I can't recall and those unspoken
- YHC took us out

It was a pleasure to plan a Tortoises Q and attempt to follow the plan. Some of the HIM present made me change the BBBs from 7's to 11's to keep you moving. Thanks for the encouragement and reminders Disco Duck and Earheart.

Note for VQ's: don't forget to 'recover'

Thanks to Chinese Downhill (sadly not present) for his relentless encouragement to face the early  gloom and get involved in F3.

The endless rewards of being a part of this group of HIM cannot be described without experiencing it.
