Arriving at 25 mins before go time to the AO, I had a moment of, “crap, did this location get relocated?” As there were no cars in the lot and thus no one doing the “EC thang”. I then also recalled that this isn’t a school and there was no pre-blast sent! Someone else would eventually show up. Nonetheless, I did my own short loop of an EC and then 14 others rolled in to join YHC for what I heard was on task for no mileage and overall solid.
