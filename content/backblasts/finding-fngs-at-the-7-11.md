A crisp and beautiful Saturday morning at Bond.   

No FNGs.  YHC points out that there were 2 FNGs at SWW just yesterday, but I haven't had one since before the pandemic.  Pledge.  Mosey across the park to the parking lot by the boathouse.      

- 7 GM IC
- 15 IW IC
- 10 Daisy Pickers IC
- Calf Stretch with 15 Merkins x 2
- Runners Stretch

Mosey back to the kiosk for the start of 7-11's.  Run to the top of the hill for 11 Merkins and run back to the boathouse parking lot for 11 squats with 7 LSF IC every time you pass the kiosk on the way.  7 Rounds.  Halfway through Ollie tells me that we have just had two FNGs drop into the workout.  YHC obviously thinks that Ollie is messing with me based on my earlier bitching and moaning, but lo and behold there are two real FNGs.  It's a Saturday miracle.  LSF IC and American Hammers IC as we wait for everyone to finish.  The ladies' running club is highly impressed as they pass.

Next we mosey up the amphitheater trail to the picnic shelter.  Big Red is obsessed with how he is going to look during speedo season, so let's focus on some chest.  Partner up for a modified Dora with 100 Merkins, 100 Irkins, 100 Dirkins and 100 Dips.  Partner 2 runs to the playground for 3 pull-ups and back.

Mosey back to the flag for some LSF IC, WW2s and H2M IC. 

Welcome to FNGs Private and Raid.  Prayers for wisdom with some important life decisions.  YHC took us out.
