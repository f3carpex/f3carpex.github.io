Not tired, just getting cranked up.

Q 7 of 10 at THE Cary/Apex AO, Bradford's Ordinary.

Tclaps to Ollie and Term for escorting YHC in on the meow mile this morning.

A sack of tanks are at the ready, Mini Me is in the house, and we're off sans FNGs at 0545.

**Warm-up:**

- Mosey towards town hall stopping at the lot by the train tracks.
- Good morning, SSH, other stuff (I can't remember anything at this point...)
- Mumble is strong, even from the Q, this is gonna be a good time.

**Thangage:**

- Mosey to pocket park. No foot baths at this time. Bear crawl the park, L/R SU. Bear crawl back, dips. Do this 4 rounds.
- Intermittent Mary.
- Get the Pax back on their feet and head for the parking garage.
- At the garage:
    - 5 Merkin 5 Squats
    - Lunge to level 2.
    - 10 Merkin 10 Squats.
    - Backwards run to level 3.
    - 15 Merkin 15 Squats.
    - All you got to the top
    - 20 Merkin 20 Squats.
- Number off, 1s and 2s.
- 1s Amrap a Mary, 2s up and down the stairwell. Flip-flop 3 times.
- Get the pax out of the garage and back to a secret little pocket park in the interior of town hall. Hey, look at that fountain!
- 3 Mary exercises and a round of Irkins, before we're back on the move and head back to the flag. There was a Hey Girl, Hey Dolly from Callahan. Classic.
- Billy run from the line, back in time for Mary.

**Mary:**

- Mini Me is a dick and calls low Peter Parkers, they are terrible.
- 2 more Marys and a round of Boat-Canoes to wrap it up.

**COT:** 15 sleeveless stud, announcements and prayers. Burt took us out.

**NMS:** Coney is my hero for tossing me in the back of his truck and giving me a ride home. I'm smoked. 3 more Qs to go. I found an pair of gloves that I left at BO weeks ago and it literally is the best part of my week.

Xoxo,

Kitty
