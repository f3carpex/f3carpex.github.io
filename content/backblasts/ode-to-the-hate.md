We had a May the Fourth workout last week... so let's follow with a May the HATEth workout! It's all about the Hate today.

 

FNG Check

Mosey over to the Kids Together playground for our warmup. Half the pax do figure Hates around the playgrounds. The other half works on cadence GM, Cotton Pickers, and CDDs.

 

Gather up, and Indian Run back out to Thurston. Turn right and head to Cary Parkway. Turn right and continue until the recover call.

Halt and safely cross the street as a group to Parkway Professional Park.

 

THE [MILLENNIAL](https://f3nation.com/exercises/):

As a group, the PAX will run down the hill behind Parkway Professional Park (approx 100 yards). We'll do an OYO exercise until someone reaches 100, and then head back up the hill to do another exercise until someone reaches 100. Repeato until we hit the burpees. The exercises are:

Merkins / LBCs / Prisoner Squats / Air Presses / L-R Ankle Touches / Star Jumps / Overhead Clap +5 penalty burpees / Freddie Mercs / Sumo Squats / BURPEES - 20 each as a penalty, additional 7 (x15 PAX) to get our last 100.

 

Mosey back to Marla Dorrel.

Mary featuring Box Cutters, Homer to Marge, and Have a Nice Day.

 

THAT'S IT.

 

COR - 11, no 12, no it's 14, no wait it's 15

NOR - 3 RESPECTS, 11 mehs, 1 HATE

NMS

The playground circles at the beginning were supposed to be figure HATEs, but a large portion of the large loop was fenced off. Thanks, progress.

 

In retrospect, this was probably the worst week that I could have picked a relatively obscure location. Uber props to Oofta for tracking us down!

 

Strong work by the PAX this morning. Proud to be your brother.
