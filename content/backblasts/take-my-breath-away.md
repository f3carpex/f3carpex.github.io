You know what makes a Q feel good?  When that special someone says at the end of the workout, "That might have been the hardest workout I've ever done."  It really takes your breath away.  Thanks Tubeless.

12 PAX gathered in the "snow"crest parking lot of Salem Park, whose students get to enjoy quite possibly the most ridiculous two hour delay ever, awaiting this so called "Lap of Pain" YHC promised.  Once Khakis screeched into the parking lot, we were off for our traditional warm up jog.  Of note, CK, in his new vest, the Breathtaker.  Strong, CK, very strong.

Warmup: SSH, GM, IW, Sir Fazio, Overhead Clap, Retro Sir Fazio, Quick Feet, Curburkin, Indian Run Lap

Lap of Pain: 100 yard bear crawl, 100 yard gorilla hop, 100 yard broad jump burpee, 100 yard crab walk.  Run back to start and then to finish line after each segment.  Failure to finish any segment = 20 Merkins, 50 LBCs.

Cool down: 100 yard wind sprints with 20/15/10/5 Merkins in between each segment.

Praises go up to CK's uncle, who passed after many years of mission work in Uganda.  We never know when this glorious thing we call life ends, so make every day count.

YHC out.
