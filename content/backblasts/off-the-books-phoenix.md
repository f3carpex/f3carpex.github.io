YHC put a call out on the slackline to pax with shorties doing Saturday school and in need of an earlier Phoenix start.  5 rang the bell...

Technically the title to this backblast doesn't work because by writing a backblast it then, by definition, is In The Books.  We won't worry about that though.  YHC probably wouldn't have written this but was persuaded by the BBBB (BackBlast Boy Band) "Frisco n' Disco".  TY4YL and the pre bootcamp dance moves (or were those penalty exercises for fantasy football??)

### Warm Up

- Frisco, Disco, Texas, Sooey, Horatio, and YHC jog it down to the Comm Center parking lot.
- Shut-In Standard Signature Warm-up - replacing standard merkins with Copperheads.  SSH with arm circles.

### Thang 1:  Kiosk

- Group 1 - Dips at the picnic benches
- Group 2 - Lunge walk around the kiosk
- Flapjack
- Group 1 - Urkins
- Group 2 - Bear crawl Kiosk
- Flapjack
- Repeatoe the entire setlist. (#TAP Repeatoe)

### Thang 2: Boathouse "Blimps"

- Texas departed to meet up with some EC runners.  And then there were 5...
- Blimps only by counting style...
- 5 Derkins, run a lap
- 5 Derkins, 10 Monkey Humpers, run a lap
- 5,10,15 Dips, run a lap
- 5,10,15,20 Merkins, run a lap
- 5,10,15,20,25 Dying Cockroaches

### Thang 3:  7s

- Run to the baseball fields next to the playground.
- Pick up Ollie on the way as he looks for the EC runners but then joins us instead.  And then there were 6 again...
- 7s on the road to parking lot (a bit of a hill)
- Burpees at the bottom. Raised arms squats at the top.

 

Indian run outta there back to the flag.  Lose Ollie as YHC has us a smidge behind schedule...

COT back at the parking lot.  Good times!
