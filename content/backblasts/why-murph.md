"In an interview, Daniel Murphy said that he was not surprised to learn about his sonâ€™s actions. 'What Maureen and I always worried about was that he would put himself in danger to help someone else, which turned out to be true,' he said. "

If you're not familiar with the story of Micheal Murphy and his final heroic acts that ultimately cost him his life I invite you click below: [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/22/us/22medal.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/22/us/22medal.html)

Memorial Day allows us to take a step back from our normal daily doings and reflect on the men and women of our armed forces who have paid the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our great country. This morning over 60 strong came out to Olive Chapel Elementary to test their mettle in a workout that Micheal Murphy himself did and called it "Body Armor". While most of us attempt to complete the 1 mile run, 100 pull-ups, 200 push-ups, 300 squats and 1 mile run without body armor or weighted vest Murphy, like so many in our elite forces, sought to push himself to the limits of his physical abilities. It is at those limits that the true training begins as the mind must take over where our body fails to us beyond our self-imposed limitations.

Having partnered up for the sake of spotting and encouraging our fellow brother through this test YHC read a small bio on Micheal Murphy and then we observed Taps.

You already know what we did but I'll say this, the effort was tremendous. So many guys pushed harder than they would have individually because their brother was going through the same grind right beside them. That is the essence of F3. Let's identify something that's really hard to do and let's do it together. Men love this stuff!

COT - Many of us carried with us in our hearts a memory of a fallen American as we worked today. During COT a few of shared who that person was and what made them an American hero.

NMMS- While I personally no longer stand a watch I still believe I and we have part to play as we come alongside those who are actively serving our country by a way of prayer. May God bless our troops and may God bless America.

Welcome FNGs Meltdown and Bagger!
