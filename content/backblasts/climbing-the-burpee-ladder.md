AO: CLAYMORE

QIC: WRENCH

PAX: BADLANDS, BARTMAN, CHEWIE, FREE BIRD, FRSICO, HEADROOM, KNEECAP, KWIK STOP, PICKLES, PRESS ON, QUIVER, SKIPPER, WHITECLAW, WRENCH, WWW

For my anniversary week, I have 5 winkies set. As I was thinking about Claymore yesterday, I was worried that it would be too much running for a limited run AO, so scratched it and started fresh. And it did not disappoint.

545 hits, mission statement and disclaimer, and short mosey to the tennis court. Warm-up consisted of:

SSHx15

GM x 10

Micheal Phelps x 10

Thang 1:

11s on the tennis court (parallel to the nets). 4 count Sumo Stomp Squats and 4 count shoulder tap Merkins. Bear crawl in the middle.

Thang 2:

Moseying burpee ladder. Basketball court 1 wolverine, 10 vanilla squats. Tennis court parking lot, 2 plank jack burpees, 10 vanilla Merkins. Baseball field parking lot, 3 tuck jump burpees, 10 4 count mountain climbers. Grass behind baseball field, 4 navy seal Burpees, 10 WW2s. Mosey to the flag, 5 standard Burpees, 10 Dan Taylors.

Mary: Pax led. Frisco pulled out the Kwik Stop Eskimo Merkins, Homer to Marge, and what follows up Homer to Marge better than Monkey Humpers. BARTMAN led the "have a nice day".

Announcement: More limited run/no run AO options available. 4 July standard business, with exploratory AO option.

Prayers/Praises: Kwik Stop Unspoken (voiced by Chewie, KS had to take off). Quiver's friend called in hospice. Our nation.

NMS: limited run/no run AOs are fun.

HIMs always pushing themselves and others are an inspiration to me, and great company to have around.

MIAGD!
