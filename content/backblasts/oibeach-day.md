With a solid crew at OIB for the Memorial Day weekend, we summoned the best of the best for a Saturday get together at the pier.

6 Pax in toe including an FNG, plus a pup ta boot and we're off.

YHC took the reigns to start us, the '76 bicentennial shovel flag (OIB's official unofficial shovel flag) looked on, as we ran the pickle and met up for SSH, Imperial Walkers and Mountain Climbers. A set of shuffle drills through the wood blocks and then we made our way to the beach.

Thang 1: Kitty Q

- Sevens to the bridge and back to the flag for Merkins + Star Jumps

Thang 2: Burt Q

- Jack Webbs
- Series of other beat down favorites
- Back to the pier for 4 sets for runs (backwards, high knees, butt kicks, etc) with Mary exercises rolled in

Mary

- A round of Pax call it ending in Burpees and a solid COT

- Welcome FNG Banner (aka Adam Bruce Pfanmiller -- an App State bro of YHC and Repeato)
- Burt is the Mayor of OIB, YHC is his PR man
