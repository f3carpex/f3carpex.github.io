At 05:28, YHC and the site-Qs were standing there wondering if the running of Tobacco Road yesterday was going to cause an extremely low turnout for Apex's Premier Kettlebell workout (on Mondays at 5:30).

When the clock ticks 5:29, what do we see but the Ma Bell chariot coming in hot, with Goose as the co-pilot.  One minute later, off we go.

**Warm Up**

Mosey to the end of the drive, so anyone going past can question our sanity.

- Our favorite warm up exercise,10 Burpees OYO
- Joe Smith arrives (conveniently)
- SSH, Cotton Pickers, Good Mornings, Hill Billies, Sir Fazio front and back, and Overhead Claps
- Mosey back to the shelter

**Thang 1**

Partner up, select a kettlebell for your team (25# recommended), and head to the pickle court for the kettlebell version of Bearcrawl 1-2-3.  Partner 1 will work on 100 curls, 200 kettlebell swings, and 300 squats.  Partner 2 will bear crawl from endline to endline, then crawl bear back.  Flip flop until complete.  This sucks.  Many of us have removed one layer of clothing by now.

**Thang 2**

Keep partners, with Partner 1 working on 50 tricep extensions.  Partner 2 in the Chilcutt position.  Flip flop after 25 reps.  Next, we move to 100 front rows, except this time while Partner 1 is completing that, Partner 2 is BTTW.  Flip flop as many times as necessary until complete.  Time for...

**Mary**

PAX choice of various exercises using kettlebells.  Finish up with our favorite Mary exercise, the Merkin.

**COT**

- 2 respects, 4 mehs
- The Bull is April 14th, maybe some other stuff I forgot
- Prayer requests: Hi-Liter's dad, Disco Duck's M, Red Ryder's mom.  YHC took us out.

**NMS**

YHC thought about asking Earhart and Monkey Nut if there were any guidelines or restrictions on doing some other stuff in a kettlebell workout, but then remember that I'm a "ask forgiveness, not permission" kinda guy. Ma Bell appreciated that we didn't run after the warm up.  I'm just impressed he posted after TR.

It was fun to break out a variation of the Bear Crawl 1-2-3 for Hell's Bells.  Go on the F3 lexicon and you'll find this gem of an exercise.  YHC was expecting some sort of congratulatory email from the national website Nan'tan, but alas none ever arrived.  Same result, I'm satisfied it's posted.

If you haven't checked out Hell's Bells, give it a try for something different.  These guys have launched an excellent workout, and it was a pleasure to lead today.
