Hand Release Ranger Crunch Merkin:

Starting with chest on the ground, a 4 ct hand release ranger merkin: 1 -up, 2 -down, 3 -hands off ground pinching shoulder blades together while pushing elbows to butt, 4 -hands on ground; all while looking forward \[best if the 3 is held longer such as 10-15 secs\]. Great for those of us with lower back pain. 

3.1 miles covered.  Pax needed just a little more encouragement to best the 3.2 from Half at Ateam.

NMS:

Nice to meet Chipper. It was his 2nd F3 post following his naming the prior Thursday in South Wake.  Good Dude.  But aren't we all.  He has embraced the suck and unknowingly declared war on @Franklin with his high tempo run pace on the Indian Run. WVU grad, Ohio native, Atlanta transplant.

4 Kryptonite pax \[Chipper, Pet Sounds, Squatter, and YHC\] and several Ateamers \[they should've posted at Kryptonite to be mentioned here\] enjoyed regular American coffee, sizes small to large, though I would never get a large because Franklin's Barista buddy \[female\] was giving out free refills, at the Costco Starbucks.

We had a man fall behind today on the return to the flag, pax was winded and could not catch his breath.

It reminds me of last Christmas.  My sister and I were running the Jingle Bell Jog alongside the mayor.  With 1/4 mile to go, Mr Mayor mentioned he wasn't feeling well. Granted he is an avid runner, but he said he had not been feeling well but wanted to come out and support our newly minted rail trail. And besides we are pretty close. Sis and I didn't think much of it at the time.  A couple hours later his wife DMs me to share that Mr Mayor had a heart attack.  He was in the hospital not 30 minutes after we went our separate ways.

No man left behind means so many things. Helping a man push himself beyond his perceived ability. Hanging with him for encouragement. And looking after his well being.

I FAILED that day.  Thank the Lord that he was able to get himself home.

YHC will never leave a man behind unattended, ever. YHC will never not ask the questions to the Pax. Guys. That's what we are. We push pain aside and muscle through adversity. And we will often not be completely honest with one another when we are truly not feeling well.

I challenge you to be honest with yourself and with others.  If you are not feeling it, back off. If you are in discomfort, share it. We help one another.!

Thank you Ma Bell for your continued concerns over YHCs feelings. It is heart warming to know that the Nantan has your back.

It's like $4!22'5g your pants. No one can see it, but you get all warm and fuzzy inside.
