14 Men showed up to celebrate my 51 st Bday.  At 5:45 we did a slow jog to the bball courts to warm up. We opened with a moment of silence for Cheech and his family. Sorry Ma Bell I didn't see that we were supposed to do that by the flag at 5:45. I also challenged the men to reach out to someone that we might owe an apology to and also to reach out to someone and say I love you. As men typically we don't do a great job of expressing ourselves. My dad had never told me that he loved me until Gibson passed away and I hadn't told him either.  We shouldn't have to go through a tragedy to start expressing our love for each other.

 

The warm up, 23 Merkins, 10 Windmills, 15 Plank-Jacks. We then jogged to the soccer field to the rock pile. Ego rocks were selected and first exercise was Colt 45's, followed by jog around field. Next was Rock Row followed by jog around the field. Then Tricep extensions with jog around the field. Repeto.  We then jogged back to Ball court for some Lt Dan's and planks times 4. We then did some CDD's and Dying Cockroach. Next was 51 Wide Grip Merkins and LBC's. We circled up and finished with some Low Slow Fluters and LBC's.

Closed with announcements and prayers. Cheech's family needs all our our prayers. Let's push ourselves to be better men and reach out to people needing love and support.
