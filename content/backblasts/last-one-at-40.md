YHC had originally signed Two Factor up to Q this morning, but he was still recovering from his back hurting so it was only appropriate for YHC to lead. Today was my last F3 workout in my 40s since my birthday is right around the corner. Without a great plan in mind for today, it worked out pretty well. Everyone seemed to get their money's worth!

Gather at the flag, disclaimer for the FNG, quick pledge, and off we go!

Warm up - Mosey to the lower parking lot for:

- SSH
- Good Morning
- Windmill
- Daisy Picker
- Mountain Climbers
- Merkins
- Imperial walkers
- (or something like that)

Thing 1: 4-corner BLIMPS

- Mosey to corner of the parking lot. Run to each corner and complete the following:
- Burpees x 5
- LBCs x 10
- Imperial Walkers x 15
- Mountain Climbers x 20
- Plank Jacks x 25
- Squats x 30

Thing 2: Merkin/Burpee Light Pole Challenge

- Starting at the first light pole, do 1 Merkin, next do 2, up to 5 and then go back down. Stop at the gate
- Transition to 2 x Burpees every other light pole to stop sign and pack to community center parking lot

Thing 3: Rock Routine

COT:

- FNG is friends with The Commish, just passing through Carpex on his way from Ohio to Myrtle Beach. They both do wordpress stuff, so of course he gets Yoast, our favorite wordpress extension!
- Prayers for The Commish's cousin that pass recently, for Yogi's transition to a new job and helping his son, and for YHC's family as our neighbors recently moved to Kansas and its crushed my 2.0s.
- Closed with a prayer of thankfulness for this group

NMS:

- Phoenix (Bond Park) is a fun site to Q with endless options
- Solid group, Kwik Stop is QUICK! Hermes brought solid MC today!
- Happy Father's Day all!
