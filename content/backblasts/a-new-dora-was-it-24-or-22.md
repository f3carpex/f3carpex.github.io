Great morning a Wolverine -- excellent group of high impact men! All familiar faces - no FNG to to brief....

**The Warm-up:**

Start with the pledge, mosey around the pickle to basketball court & circle up

Good mornings, windmills (tough to count for some reason!), SSH, calf stretches with merkins, air chair with chinooks

**The Thang!**

Mosey south along the running trail to the big parking lot. Fast feet, bear crawl, curb dips, crab back.... repeato with crawl bear & lunges.

Modified Dora was next -- 100 merkins, 100 dying cockroaches, & 100 squats split up over 5 cycles. 20 of each exercise, sprint across the soccer field to the track & jog the track back to the start. Repeat 4 more time to get your 100 of each.

Mosey to church lot for a wave of merkins, then side plank star crunches.

Mosey to playground as we need some back work -- 20 quality pull ups each.

Head back around pickle & billy run to the flag -- finished up with LBCs, Homer-to-Marge, & Have a Nice Day......
