## Preamble

Good thing Kittibonz posted the Q sheet on Slack Sunday or I might have forgotten I had the Kryptonite Q. Once reminded, I was all in pre-blasting my intention of throwing some blue collar beatdown on these one-trick ponies that gallop around the AO. Not to worry; I know these thoroughbreds gotta eat. That said, methinks they were all a'skeered they weren't going to get their miles in - which is why the parking lot was unusually full of cars and devoid of PAX when the West Cary clown car arrived. Anyway, FNG Justin was in the circle so disclaimer was given and off we went.

## Warm-Up

Break into groups of 3 or 4 for a jaunt of catch-me-if-you-can around Symphony Lake, alternating 4 x real sumo squats and 4 hand release merkins. We took a left on the far end to head out to Regency Pkwy and over to some parking lot with a hill. Somewhere along the way, word reached YHC through the grapevine that Burt was wondering when the warm-up was. I was pretty warm myself. Maybe he was issuing a challenge. Guess I need to ramp up my Q game. Anyway, 1.25 miles later, we reached our warm-up spot at the bottom of the parking lot hill and did

- 20 x SSH IC
- 10 x Abe Vigodas IC
- 10 x Diamond Merkins IC

## The Thang

Crazy 8s up and down the hill - world's worst merkins at the top, dying cockroaches at the bottom. Either plank it out or pick up the six when done. Six is in, follow me. On around Regency Pkwy we went. Along the way, there are 8 stops where we did a set of 8s at each - descending froggers, ascending squats. When you reach the stop sign, either stay and do SSHs or go pick up the six. Six is in, follow me. The PAX had warned me that we would be cutting it close. We had about 3/4 of a mile to go and 7 minutes to get there. So, next exercise is follow me. We hot-footed back to the flag and got there with 20 seconds to spare. Well, most of us. As I told FNG "despite what I said during the disclaimer, we apparently do leave some behind." At least YHC did. Thanks to more worthy HIM, no one was actually left behind. The PAX who got back to the flag on time amused themselves with some Mary and count-a-rama until the six was safely in

## COT

- Count-a-rama - I thought it was 25 but apparently it was only 23
- Name-a-rama: Quite a few RESPECTS out galloping with the thoroughbreds. No Hates
- Announcements: trunk coffee afterward.
- Prayers - Old Maid 2.0's teacher who was in a car accident Sunday

## NMS

- Not many announcements lately. Must be the slow season.
- Trunk coffee is much appreciated. It's a lot of work for somebody
- Despite me joking with the runners as elite (they really are) or one-trick ponies, I truly admire you guys. Ima still mix it up with running and cycling though mkay?
- Welcome FNG "Heartbreaker." His first concert was Tom Petty. Not much else to work with. Kidding, of course there was. Thanks to Honeycomb for EH'ing him.
- It was an honor to lead. I was told by Denali I graded out as "adequte." I'll take it.
- MIAGD
