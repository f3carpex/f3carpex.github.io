YHC and 4 members of the F3CARPExDIEM BRR Team spent the weekend battling mountains, so there were to be no squats today. While the PAX waited at the locked front gate, a local seasoned citized walked up and informed the PAX the he had just seen a video with a self driving bike. He couldn't belive we would send our kids to school on a self driving bike. What's next? BONG - 6:45 sharp - after a quick scan for FNG's we were off (Whoops)
