It was a special type of Tank Top Thursday at Bounty Hunters as a few followed in the footsteps of Cameron Poe played by the electrifying Nicolas Cage and wore sleeveless undershirts. Well... his picture electrified Slack for about 10 minutes anyway. In all, about half of us were in tanks so a good showing.

We Pledged our Allegiance to Old Glory and then moseyed over to nice spot between Apex Town Hall and Apex Community Center to get warmed up.

Warmup

- Cotton Pickers
- Good Mornings
- Bat Wings
- Annie (would have deeper meaning by the end)
- T-Claps
- Superman

Mosey over to the pickle by the huge white water tower proclaiming APEX for Thang1

Thang 1

- 11's (Diver Bombers and Peter Parkers)

Mosey back to the baseball diamond for Thang2

Thang 2

- Dora at the Diamond
    - 100 Diamond Merkings
    - 200 Carolina Drydocks
    - 300 Dips
    - Partner runs the bases like he just jacked one over left field wall

Sometimes it's necessary to call an audible so we picked up a little half way through and headed back to the flag for mary
