With Yogi on the sideline (rest well sweet Prince) the run-and-gun (hold on that run) duo of Hello Kitty and Pierogi were the next men up to lead an All-American beat down at Danger Zone.

**Warmup:**

Kitty led the PAX for a warmup lap around the pickle at a noticeably low-slow tempo. Circle up in honor of the 10-year anniversary of the Mighty Mountaineers defeating the #5 ranked Michigan Wolverines IN THE FRIGGIN’ BIG HOUSE, 34-32:

- Good morning (some count not tied to 34-32)...ok now to the theme
- Merkin x 34
- Imperial Walker (Kitty took the liberty of modifying for a Hilly Billy) x 32
- Sir Fazio Arm Circles Forward x 17
- Sir Fazio Arm Circle Backward x 17
- Merkin x 2 (as in 34-32=2)

**Thang 1:**

With storm clouds looming, and the Kitty not interested in a rain game, the PAX shuffled to the shelter. To keep the other team on their toes we called a play rarely seen in the 1st Quarter… a Hail Mary, “on your six!” for:

- LBC x 34 in cadence
- Plank on a 32 count (Hi-Liter… nice and slow)
- Freddy Mercury x 34 in cadence
- Plank on a 32 count
- WWII (PAX love you Yogi) on my up x 17
- Plank on a 32 count
- Merkin on up x 17
- Plank on a 32 count

**Thang 2:**

With Hello Kitty still reliving the glory that was the 2007 App State Mountaineers, Pierogi took the PAX through a series of celebration routines. We have a lot to celebrate in CARPex!

Celebration Merkins:

Split the PAX into three groups of 5.

1 PAX on the table with remaining 4 PAX lifting HIM up.

10x ‘merkins on table with remaining 4 PAX squatting (with table!) in cadence.

Rotate through all 5 PAX

Mini DORA (it’s a celebration ‘cause it’s shorter):

50 ‘merkins

100 dips

150 lunges (each leg one)

Touchdown starts with a “T”:

Starting position move:

IC, left arm only, right arm stays out:

10x ITY-bITY Sir Fazio arm circles

10x ITY-bITY in reverse

10x bigly arm circles

10x ylgib arm circles

Repeato with other arm. Although simple, there were a lot of droopy arms at the end.

4x 5-count flow sequence of Arms Up (TD signal), Al Gores, Plank Hold, Lunge Hold, Warrior-1

**Announcements:**

- Next F3 Dads is 9/16
- Pet Sounds PAX weekend (not broke back at all) is 9/15

**Prayers:**

- Hi-Liter and his M on a safe trip celebrating their 19th – congrats you two
- Flip-Flop’s friend who was hurt
- For Houston and strength/prayers to Texas

**NMS:**

- Hello Kitty: As always, it is an honor to lead the PAX through a post, and happy to step up and step in for Yogi while he heals up that tweaked back. Today I hope you all got a little stronger, I know I did, physically, mentally and emotionally. For that I thank all of you HIM and let’s go out and attack the day with an enthusiasm unknown to man.
