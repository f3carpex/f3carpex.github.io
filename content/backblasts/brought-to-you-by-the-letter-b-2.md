**COT**

- Welcome FNG, Mudgear

**NMS**

- Reposted from Shank yesterday: @McCants closed COT this morning at FMJ and said something that struck me, because I know I am guilty of this. I think we take for granted how lucky we are to be able to do this - to do F3 - to challenge our bodies in the early mornings, to be around other HIM’s like Mccants, and lift each other up. So the next time you think about fartsacking, don’t! Get up, push yourself, and be grateful you get to do this...and bring that friend that keeps popping in your mind too. He needs F3 too.
