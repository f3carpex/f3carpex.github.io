Thank you BO Site Q/ Twitter Owner whoever you are for reminding me of my Q this am.  I was well on my way to Cave Workout until I saw the tweet.   Whew.

Hating that I will miss the 1776 workout on the 4th (no, not really), I thought it would be fun to do a thematic workout this morning.    I busted out the red-white-blue apron and wore it over my USA Tank.   Budweiser Flag Trucker Hat.    Boom.

A beautiful morning it was.  Low 60's clear.    Shovel flag planted.   Extra tanks displayed for those who want to experience the full effect of TTT.  WKRP, Mississippi and Jiggly Puff donned them.    WKRP put his tank over his shirt...kinda like wearing socks with sandals.   WKRP is rocking the workouts these days...pushing it.   Good work my man.

Country Club Car shows up....Nabs and Term Paper pop out fresh from mixer at the Club.
