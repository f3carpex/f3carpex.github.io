**NMS**

- A big thanks to all the Carpex Pax.  After a couple weeks of Water Wings telling me about F3 I skeptically gave it a try for the first time around Memorial Day.  I've been posting on a regular basis since and the results (physically, spiritually, relationships, the list goes on) speak for themselves.  I'm grateful for this group of men and the impact it's had on me.  Thanks for putting in the work and following my lead, it was an honor to lead this group of HIM.
