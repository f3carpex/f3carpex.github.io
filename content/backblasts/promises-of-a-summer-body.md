Upon checking the Q sheet, YHC noticed no one grabbed Hells Bells. As Site Q, I could’ve pushed this to another PAX member but decided to step up and grab it. I’m still working on organizing a workout without the assistance of a winkie. Arriving at Cornerstone I noticed it was raining, I didn’t check the weather so whatever, gloomy is fine by my standards. Pulling out the bells the PAX started rolling in at 0520. Realizing I pulled too many bells out of the box, I decided we could put the extras to use during the workout. As promised during the preblast, we worked on our summer bodies in an effort to continue looking good (partially) naked.
