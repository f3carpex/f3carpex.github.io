For our Wednesday version of the CarPex/Southwake Q-swap, we "limited" our running to Shuttle Sprints and Agility work. We started on cones and ladder drills, moving into shuttle sprints. In between each group of 5 shuttles, we did merkins, flutterkicks, WWIIs, Burpees,  mountain climbers, and something Theisman called. We ended Mary with American Hammers.

COT: Prayers for family going into surgery, South Wake's Crablegs battling ALS.

Announcements: Upcoming CSAUPs, F3 Chatham The Gambler Mar 3, Churham The Mule Mar 10, South Wake The Crawl \[Rucking Pub Crawl\]. BRR info session tonight at Dohertys in Apex.
