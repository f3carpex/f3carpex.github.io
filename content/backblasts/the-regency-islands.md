Drew the Back in Black Q for the second time in its short history, and I didn't quite get to do what I had planned the [first time](https://f3carpex.com/2018/12/06/ost/)... so after a deeper recon dive, let's hit it.

8 HIM gathered after the flag, and after a site-Q recommended disclaimer, off we go for a

- quick lap around the lot
- enter the Symphony Lake greenway, but then turn left back toward the road
- cross the street using the crosswalk and circle up in the lot for GM/IW/CP/SM

Thang 1 - PARTNER UP!

Using the three tucked-away-from-the-major-thoroughfare-of-the-parking-lot islands and the associated parking sections, Partner 1 will circle the island while Partner 2 paints the lines to the end and runs back. For the island circles:

- bear crawl the first one
- lunge walk the second one
- crawl bear the third one

Recover, 10-count, follow me out to Regency Parkway, heading north. Pause at the first light for 10 standard merkins, and let's continue.

Thang 2 - STILL PARTNER'D UP

Collect one non-travelling rock per partnership, and gather offcenter of the first lot. Each partner is responsible for bearcrawling 6 islands, while alternating with the performance of a rock exercise of the PAX choice. No need to micromanage there.

Return the rocks, mosey back out to Regency Parkway, and line up for Indian Run back toward the turn toward our lot. Pause to cross together (using the crosswalks), and mosey back to the flag.

Quick Mary featuring Boxcutters and LBCs and a mini HAND. THAT'S IT!

COR - 8  
NOR - 7 meh, 1 RESPECT

Great to meet High Splits today! Keep at it, bro.  
  
No hate meant here at all - I'm not sure that BiB has ever been problematic. And that is this AO's great strength. 5:15 is a tall order... but props to those who push to get out there (and double props to Repeato and Joe Smith for hitting that 4:40 EC).  
  
There will be NO props however for the man occupying the one stall at the nearby Harris Teeter at 4:55am. Left a solid 25 minutes post-recon/pre-workout for a specific purpose, but my plans were thwarted hardcore by that resource constraint.  
  
My recon led me down a path to a swamp... hoping to get over there in the future when it's not quite so swampy.  
  
Almost unlocked the 'using a porto-potty twice at the same AO' acheivement (albeit a different day (vs Krypto) and at a different potty (in the warmup lot)), but, alas, the need was fleeting (PTL).  
  
I had a blast. Perfect jumpstart for a packed Thursday. Thank you all for helping me to get better.
