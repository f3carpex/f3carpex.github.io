Decided to do a BLIMPish workout called BRAVES. Perfect timing to call this since their playoff runs tend to be brutish, nasty and short. Was going to do all exercises in increments of 5 but due to their 9th inning loss the night before we did increments of 10 instead.

Run around pickle each after each exercise

Burpees 10

Reverse Lunge 20

Alternating shoulder taps  30

V Up 40

Elbow to Knee 50 (Should have told everyone to wear their elbow pads)

Squats 60

Hmm. Still 10 minutes left so did 100 yard sprints, backwards run, and Karaoke

Big Boy Sit Ups 12
