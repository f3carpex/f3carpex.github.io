We Murphed. It was glorious. Almost exactly 1 mile run to a playground at Mama's Boy's neighborhood pool. There were tunes. Hello Kitty doesn't much care for the Rolling Stones. Nobody argued with him. Joe Smith is STRONG at pull-ups. STRONG.

By the way, Dazed & Confused is back at Apex High School. Try to park as far away as possible as not to upset teachers with assigned parking spots. And circle up off to the side so incoming teachers don't run you over.

NMS:

- Collared shirts are the up and coming standard attire for a respectful Q.
- If ever in need of a Q plan, just Murph it. But make sure you or the site Q knows where to find some pull-up bars.
- Thanks to you all for the encouragement to finish this May challenge. Could not do it without you. No way.
