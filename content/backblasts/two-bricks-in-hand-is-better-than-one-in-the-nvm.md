When Frisco asked me to Q Claymore, I was more than happy to oblige him. We settled on a date until we didn't. In typical Frisco fashion, he had already promised the agreed upon date to another PAX. So YHC happily shifted to the right on the calendar and here we were. On a lovely 62 degree morning, Annie Jones Park was our oyster. Twelve gathered for the Pledge of Allegiance where in the shadow of Old Glory sat a yard cart full of landscape bricks YHC pulled from his garage that morning.

NMS -- so much to say when Frisco is involved..... But seriously, I continue to be amazed by this group of PAX on a daily basis for a whole host of reasons. It really is quite encouraging and comforting. We all carry our own burdens and challenges and we also frequently carry the burdens of others. What starts out small like a 1.5 brick can end up overwhelming us and our abilities in just a short amount of time. Seek to release those burdens. Seek to rely on your fellow man to help you with those burdens. We are better together. All PAX achieved and held their bricks. Recover.
