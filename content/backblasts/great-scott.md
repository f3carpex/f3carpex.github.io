Saw an empty Q spot on Sunday night, so I scooped it up. I knew it was meant to be when I saw Pickles at Wolverine and he needed to pass the flag along. That was heavy!

Now I planned this workout while watching the Bachelor last night. There's always a temptation to bring in some rose-themed flair to the morning, but I took a peek at the date for inspiration. 1/21... see the hidden message for that connection.

VERRRRRRRY thankful for Blowout this morning. If he wasn't there, I can't say that I would have done the Johnny B. Goode by myself. Two guys holding rocks in the air while playing Chuck Berry on a bluetooth speaker in a park at 6AM was adventure enough. Props to you for coming out, I had a blast!
