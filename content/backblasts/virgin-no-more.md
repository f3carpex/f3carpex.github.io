Woke up early for my VQ at 4. Anxious to get started I guess. Decided it was too early to get up, and slept until my alarm went off.

What’s that I hear? Rain? Great, need to modify already. I planned on doing step ups on the bleachers but did not want to risk the safety of the PAX so had to come up with an alternate. More on that later.

16 showed up. Claymore is drawing a nice crowd. Frisco brought an FNG. Where does he find so many friends? Maybe friend is a bit harsh, acquaintances. Yeah, that’s better. Give him the briefing and disclosure and then we’re off.

**Warmup:** Run up the parking lot around the loop. Claymore is the brightest AO in all of Carpex, too bright after coming from the gloom of Wolverine the day before. Up to the gloom of the basketball court we go. GMs, WMs, Chill Cut MCs, LBCs, AC, SC, OC, Reverse AC. On to thing one

**Thang1:** The lower parking lot is sloped, took advantage of this natural slope to do a round of 11s with Irkins at the top on the curb and derkins at the bottom, no help needed with the slope. Although some felt it necessary to put their feet on the curb, so it was more of a merkin for some. These were the Copperhead variety, 1-2-3 down and quick up. It was good we did them together, since Frisco was having a hard time counting.

**Thang 2:** Count of by 3. Great you can all count to three now partner up. Just want to make sure no one forgets the cluster of Frisco’s Q from a few weeks ago. DORA 1-2-3 on the bleachers. 100 London Bridges, 200 Dips, 300 LBCs, depending on which bleacher you were on you either ran up to the upper parking lot first space or across the lower parking lot to the farthest space. 100 LR Step Ups would’ve been much easier than 100 London Bridges, especially after 110 combined irkins and derkins. Crimson called 20 LBCs to help teams finish out.

**Thang 3:** Head over to the tennis court, line up in Peoples Chair, run to end of line to a chill cut BTTW and call next PAX in line. 16 PAX was a long time to stay in BTTW. I had another exercise planned, but there was no time for that. There’s always next time.

**Mary:** Back to the flag for Mary, YHC called FMs, EarhardT DC, Frisco AH, Crimson HD, and Pickles Merkins, like we hadn’t already done enough of those. Have a Nice Day.

**Count-A-Rama:** 16

**COT:**

The Mule, Q Source

**Prayers:**

Ausfart – continued recovery

Swags M – surgery yesterday went well. She should be coming home today.

Sooey – surgery on Friday. He will be missing the gloom for some time afterwards.

YHC took us out.

It was truly an honor and a privilege to lead you this am.
