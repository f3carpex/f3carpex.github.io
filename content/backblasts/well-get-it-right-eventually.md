The gloomiest AO in Cary in downright pleasant as dawn starts to creep in.  A nice crowd is already gathered around the flag as YHC rolls in.

Pledge.  Take a lap around the parking lot and circle up on the basketball court.      

- 5 GM IC
- 25 SSH IC
- 15 Imperial Walkers IC
- Calf Stretch
- 15 Merkins OMD
- Calf Stretch
- 15 Merkins OMD
- Runners Stretch

Move over to the jogging path and line up behind YHC.  A traditional Indian Run with a stop for exercises every time YHC makes it back to the front.  Ascending Merkins OMD for the first mile and ascending LSF IC for the second mile.  I believe we can safely say that our execution on this portion of the workout is less than crisp.  Part of the issue could be that we have an FNG who has snuck into the workout late.  Once this is discovered, he is informed that he can't sue us and the rest of the detail will be filled in at a later time.

Move over to the playground and partner up for a Dore Murph with 100 Pull Ups / 200 Merkins / 300 Squats and a parking lot pickle run.  We likely don't have time for this, but a man needs a stretch goal.  We don't finish.  And I'm not confident anyone is even counting by the end.   

Mosey back to the basketball court for Heels to Heaven, American Hammers and Chilcutt. Welcome FNG Wreck.  Prayers for a safe upcoming surgery for Red Ryder's Mother.  YHC took us out.
