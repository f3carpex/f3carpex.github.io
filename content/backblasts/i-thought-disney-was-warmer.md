Day 4 of #QSwapWeek had YHC and Yoga Mat repping the squad.....with no Carpex flag. Whoops...

Lots of guys showed up for this one. We can recount them in the blurry picture to be sure.

**Warmup** \- Yoga kicked things off with a warmup that by the end felt more like a beatdown! **Merkins** and **shoulder work**.

The Thang

Run to the big giant parking lot one would typically only find in Orlando pulling up to the most magical place on earth.

**Monkey Humpers** around the parking lot stopping and escalating your count at each median. 1,2,3,4........18. There are 18 medians around the border of the parking log.

P1 - Start **Broad Jump Burpee**(ing) the long length of the lot. P2 run a skinny lap around the medians to meet back with P1 and flapjack until as a team you've burpeed the entire length.

4 Corners of **Hand Release Merkins** - 5, 10, 15, 20.

P1 - **Start Bear Crawling** the long length. Same as the other P1,P2 exercise before.

Head back the flag and stop for some Shut-In Signature **Aussie Mtn Climbers**

**Mary** \- Yoga Mat finished us off with some **LBCs**, **Freddys**, and **Boats n' Canoes**. A comet was spotted during Have a Nice Day.

If you were there and I missed your name it's because I'm writing this late and the picture is blurry. My bad!!
