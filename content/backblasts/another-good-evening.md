Another adventure in the Chronicles of Rush Hour was commencing as a pax of 6 gathered around for the beatdown.  So, jumping right into it, after the Pledge of Allegiance we were off and parking lot next to Academy street for warmups.

**Warmups:**

- Good Evenings
- SSH
- Sir Fasio Arm Circles (forward and reverse)
- Cotton Pickers
- High Knees

**Thang 1:**

Running along Academy Street, we did **Ascending and Descending Merkins** at each lightpole.  Starting from 1 going to 5, then coming back down from 5 to 1.  We stopped at the fountain.

**Thang 2:**

**American Hammers** on the fountain, then three rounds of Fountain exercises:

- Round 1: **Irkins, Dips, Dirkins, WWII, Squats** (10 reps); 5 **burpees** OYO
- Round 2: Repeato (15 reps); 5 more **burpees** OYO
- Round 3: Repeato excepts **American Hammers** instead of WWII (10 reps); 5 more **burpees** OYO

**Thang 3:**

We made our way back the way we came by doing 5 **jump lunges** at every third lightpole, and **Left right step ups** at the bench areas.

**Thang 4:**

In our favorite grassy area, we partnered up. Partner 1 did **LBC’s**, while Partner 2 **Bear Crawled** from one side to the other, did 10 **wall jumps**, then **bear crawled** back, then switch.  After that, Repeato.

**Mary:**

- Heels to Heaven
- Boat Canoe
- Hello Dolly
- Freddy Mercs
- Homer to Marge
- Fludder Kicks
- 100’s

**Announcements:**
