It's a beautiful day in downtown Cary, and YHC plants the flag, armed with a workout plan that might involve the pain sticks. But as the the clock ticks 5:45 YHC realizes this will be a solo adventure, so the original plan gets shelved for a later date and today's workout becomes an exploratory run. With the longer days we have parts of the area available to us that we couldn't use in the darkness of winter. So with Meriwether Lewis as my inspiration YHC explored new territories, making mental notes and mapping out future workouts.

Back at the flag for COT, YHC reflects on the moving homegoing celebration for Hi-Liter's father this morning and prays for my M and her continuing health issues.

Just before departing there's a familiar face, it's Captain Kirk! So we shared a nice conversation about F3, Slack and the history of downtown Cary.
