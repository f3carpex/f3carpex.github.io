**NMS**: Before I joined F3 a little over a year ago, I would have never imagined working out on my birthday. Last year the first convergence after I joined Carpex was memorial day. After that workout, I still did not think I would Q a workout, but hey here we are. If you are on the fence about Q'ing, do it. Getting my name on the Q sheet keeps me motivated to go to workouts, and I generally push myself harder when I am Q'ing as I don't want to let anyone down.
