First, let me start with what we did NOT do. I got a little flustered right at the start as I was introducing myself to Backporch only to realize that it was already 5:45 on the ol' Garmin. You can't be tardy to Q School! Let's Go!

So here's what you missed... a quiz about the formerly most famous Q of them all.

Nowadays the anonymous Q is probably more famous but for men of a Meh-generation... and of a particularly nerdy disposition... this guy was the man!

So here goes... a quiz about the most famous Q of them all (answers in the NMS):

1. What is the name of the actor who played Q?
2. What is the name of the ST:TNG episode where Q first appeared?
3. Where does Q hail from?

But sadly the PAX were spared from this experience as it was time for the pledge and time to get started. But before we go anywhere, we need to recite the F3 Disclaimer. This is Q School so it was time to bust out the official version. I'm trying to figure out if it was Texas Ranger or Captain Jack who wrote this. Too many big words for it to have been Joe Smith. And too many words period for it to have been McCants.

Anywho... starting position Squat:

I skipped the paragraph about the F3 Marks, which I am 99% sure Captain Jack wrote, but you are welcome to enjoy that [here](https://f3nation.com/use-of-f3-trademarks/).

**Warm-up**

Moseyed to the middle of the road leading into SNS to demonstrate to the PAX where not to circle up. You have to show people you know what not to do just as much as what to do. Otherwise they think you're just getting lucky all the time.

YHC led the PAX in a couple perfectly executed cadence demonstrations. I think F3Nation needs to pay me to update their clearly 9 year old version here. Check out the cargos on Dredd! But at least we know that Mudgear always came in size Schmedium and Short.

Mosey across the street to St. Michael's in honor of Ash Wednesday today.

**Cadence Practice**

To get the PAX in the spirit of practicing cadence counting and calling out exercises, we played a round of "Decipher the Hashtag". Get it right and you get to call the exercise. Get it wrong and I forgot what we had to do.

#DOAH

#43F

#3S2T

#NPIP

#DTWR (note: Cally guessed Do The Wrong Thing. Which he did)

Nice job from Back Porch and Gambit jumping in with a few of their own.

**7's**

It's getting cold so time to warm up with 7's in the parking lot with Diamond Merkins and Star Jumps. Saban was happy at the mileage. Up to that point I think we had hit 0.3.

**More Cadence Practice**

Over to the other side of St. Michael's we circled up again for a round of "Who Said it?". I dug up some quotes from the Twitterverse and Google and the goal was to figure out if the quote was from Dredd, DOAH or Alexander Hamilton. The PAX were 50/50 on this one. Unfortunately my cheat sheet got washed in the laundry again so you only get one:

> Men give me credit for some genius. 
> 
> Alexander Hamilton

This was fun. I wonder if the new guys knew who Dredd or DOAH are though. They probably thought we were weird. Hope the come back.

**Mary**

Back to the ol' flag to meet up with Vesper and Maynard crews. Some Mary to fill the last several minutes. Back Porch took us out with calf stretches on his down.

**COT**

Solid group. I enjoyed the time with everyone. No announcements.

Prayers for winter weather in the South, tornados in the East, the passing of loved ones, healing for sick friends and a happy return to school for the little ones.

**NMS**

Thanks for the nudge Disco Duck. I enjoyed it. Hope yall did too.

Answers below. Highlight the text to reveal what I know about 2 1/2 of you actually care about... being right:

1. John De Lancie
2. Encounter at Farpoint
3. The Continuum

Fun fact... the answer to #3 is the name of the SciFi club my friend Christy and I formed in college. We had one meeting. Two girls showed up. It was a success.
