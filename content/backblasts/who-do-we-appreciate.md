Burt shows up with his big box speaker and plays the soothing sounds of the Rick Dees classic Disco Duck while we wait for all the PAX to arrive. The clocks strikes 05:30, play time is over, time to get to work.

**Warm-Up**

Mosey over to the Global Knowledge parking lot and take a lap, then circle up for side straddle hops, mountain climbers, standard merkins and plank jacks.

**The Thang**

Using the corners of the lap we just took around the parking lot, let's play Who Do We Appreciate?

Run to the next corner, two reps of an exercise.

Run to the next corner, four reps of an exercise.

Run to the next corner, six reps of an exercise.

Run to the last corner, eight reps of an exercise.

Five rounds, here are the exercises.

Mosey over to the bottom of the hill next to the office building.

Mosey back to the flag along the amphitheater side of Symphony Lake.

**Mary**

Circle up for and go around the horn for PAX-led Mary exercises until we run out of time.

**COT**

**Count-a-rama**:  19 **Name-a-rama**:  4 RESPECTs, 13 meh, 2 HATEs **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers and praises for Half, his M and their new son, prayers for Texas Ranger's mother as she has a medical procedure later this week, praises for Water Wings' grandmother who received a pace-maker recently. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**

Chanticleer had never heard the song Disco Duck. These kids today, they think they know what bad music is, but they don't know. Respects and near-respects, we know what bad music really is.

Kotters to LuLu, good to have him back in the gloom.

If I hadn't stopped Hermes we might still be doing LBCs.

I counted at least three men making their Kryptonite debuts. Hope you enjoyed it Red Ryder, Shank and Yoga Mat.

It was a championship celebration, we had Khakis and Red Ryder there this morning, less than 24 hours after their victory in the Haven House cornhole tournament.

Also over $40K was raised for Haven House.

The PAX seemed pleased to get through a Disco workout with no burpees.

I looked around this morning and I saw 18 men who I love and respect, and for those awesome men to follow me around a giant parking lot at 5:30 in the morning is just humbling for me. Thank you for being there, brothers.
