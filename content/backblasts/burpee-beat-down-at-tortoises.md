Disco Duck said it best, "It wouldn't be tortoises if we weren't doing burpees."

Five came out for a burpee beat down at Tortoises. Warmed up with side straddle hop, good mornings, windmills, merkins, mountain climbers, plank jacks. Jogged over to "the hill" where we started the burpee 11's. Sumo squats on one end, burpees on the other. Then, some WWII's and flutters. Next, we grabbed the cores for sets of curls, overhead press, rock rows, and merkins intermixed with lunges while we traversed the length of the parking lot. Then, wonder bra and balls to the wall before doing the sets of curls, overhead press, rock rows, and merkins again. Finished up with American hammers.

COT: Announcement that a special Father's Day workout gathering is being planned for dad's to bring their little ones. More details forthcoming. Also, Sovereign Grace Church, Apex, where Tortoises meet is having a Block Party this Saturday, June 3rd, from 12 noon to 4 PM with free food, games, inflatables, and all are welcome to attend. Prayers for "Sarge," a friend of WWW who has throat cancer, and for Earhart.

Next time you come to Tortoises be prepared for some burpees.
