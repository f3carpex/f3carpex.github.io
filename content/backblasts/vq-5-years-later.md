**47 degrees** in September...yes please!  
**21 pax** left their warm cozy beds to suffer a bit in the gloom _(even 1 high schooler! William "Braveheart" Wallace Marriott IV)._

* * *

So here is how this Beatdown was birthed...**YHC VQ'd at FOD back in May of 2015.** This past month I've been back to FOD a couple times and was excited to see the path around the baseball fields was FINALLY finished! We used to run the mess out of that loop and it got me thinking back to the early days of FOD...which got me to look up my VQ backblast...which got me to copy it for this morning and not have to think of something new!

Let's see how well it aged. For some (ahem, Beaker), the verdict was in on Slack pretty early. Maybe the fact we did **1.99 miles** left people wanting more?

Warmup

- Side Straddle Hops
- Good Mornings
- Mountain Climbers
- **INVISIBLE JUMP ROPES** - a crowd favorite! Even **a double dutch started up**! Highly recommend you add this to your standard warmup sequence.

Thang 1

- Urkins, bench urkins, derkins, dips x 10
- Run a lap with stops for 5 burpees, 10 knee tuck jumps, 15 prisoner squats, 20 ALRSUps
- Urkins, bench urkins, derkins, dips x 10
- Run the lap again but up each rep count by 5

Thang 2

- Grab a rock and a partner and head to the bball court
- P1s line up on the **wall** fence
- P2s line up on the **baseline** sideline
- P1s will do rock reps, P2s will run sprints
- Set 1: Curls / 1 sprint (flap jack)
- Set 2: Curls / 2 sprints (flap jack)
- Set 3: Overhead presses / 3 sprints (flap jack)
- Set 4: Hold the rock straight out / 2 sprints (flap jack)
- Set 5: Curls / 1 sprint (flap jack)

Mary / COT

- WWIIs **done the right way**
- Low Slow Flutters (done slow)
- Dying Cockroaches

NMS

- FOD could be an hour long. It's a great site with lots to do...and I'm not even including **breaking in to the baseball stadium!**
- Mumblechatter was in abundant supply, thank you guys for that.
- It was nice to see some newer pax got to hang out with **angry Shut-In**. Hopefully they liked him - he means well, he just likes to yell at a few pax he doesn't particularly like.
- **He won't name names** though.
- Term Paper and Braveheart shared a **quarter zip** pull over.
- FOD has the **cutest shovel flag** in Carpex, that's all I'll say. You have to post there to see it - or hopefully it's at the Odyssey.
- The screwyness of the basketball court sprints and rocks stuff was due to the large number of pax. Sometimes you gotta adapt your plan to a larger crowd and **the outcome is less desirable** than you had planned.
- Seriously, if you haven't Q'd or have only Q'd once, it's time to get on the sheet! www.f3carpex.com/q - **go do it!**
- Glad to hang with you West Cary boys. Venture south sometime and **see some new faces** if you haven't yet.
- _Liverpool and Franklin are who Angry Shut-In doesn't like._
