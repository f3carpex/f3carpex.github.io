No FNGs. We're off to the bottom of "Miss Hill" with stop on the way to warm-up: SSH, IW, Sir Fabio arm circles, Mtn Climbers, Merkins

Lets celebrate C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S. Run to Green Level Church Rd, 10 of exercise, return, "Penitent Lunges" till the 6 completes 10 \[slow knee to the ground lunges, with slightly bowed head. Get the picture?\] Flapjack.

C Chilcutt Peter Parkers H Hand-release Burpees R Reverse Crunch IC I Imperial Walker IC S Sleeping Hillbillies T Travolta Merkins M Merkins IC A Alphabet - 1 round S Squat Jumps

Out of time, back to flag for COT.

Announcements: FMJ Murph on Boxing Day after Christmas 7 am, New Year's convergence at A-team 7-8am with Qs Disco Duck and Parker.

Prayer concerns: Parker's father moving into retirement home on January, Hi-Liter's father's recovery, those traveling for Christmas. Gomer with bum knee.

YHC took us out. Let us remember the reason for Christmas and continue to act with and spread love, grace, forgiveness.

NMS Ma Bell, Sky blue, and Tubeless, you sirs received all the praise with your EC run in from FOD. Tclaps to the Tobacco Road 1/2 Marathoners with EC run in from and back to FOD, Ma Bell and Sky blue. Tubeless, though offered an almost valiant effort, relegated to "attaboy" Parker snuggling up with Saban, calling out the time. Let's just chalk the extra time up to CHRISTMAS spirit. Biner, the "alphabet" is with legs and not the tongue. This is not a FIA workout. Goose complaining about BURPEES. As site Q, did you even check the Q sheet? Always good to see the men picking up the 6. Literally. Tclaps Sky Blue and Parker.
