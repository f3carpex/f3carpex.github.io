Most call it a shield lock - others call it a boy band, but one thing is clear. When your fellow boy band member calls you in from the bullpen due to being placed on the temporary disabled list, you step up. Hamm may appear to be invincible and has often used the motto "You can't hurt steel," but he does pull up limp from time to time despite all of that. When asked to cover for him, I did a quick check of the weather, saw a balmy 57 degrees in the forecast and said, "let's do this!"

After a quick check for FNGs (seeing none) and warning the group of my unforgiving unprofessional-ism, we pledged allegiance and I took off on a stroll to our old Disturbing the Peace stomping grounds at Apex Baptist Church. Everyone seemed to follow.

**Warm Up**

Haven't been able to post with him in a while so we had to honor my man Crimson.

- Crimson Good Mornings (Just like regular GMs but no cadence, just go down…stay there…moan a little…come back up…maybe)
- While in Crimson Good Mornings, Michael Phelps
- Plank (16-count, because…you know)
- Following 16 count, and staying in plank position:
    
    - Annies
    
    - Wax On/Offs
    
    - Calf stretch
    
    - Control Freak Merkins

**Thang 1**

Mosey to the bottom of the hill next to the church parking lot while avoiding the 5:45am traffic in downtown Apex.

7's with Robert Kraft Merkins and Sumo Squats. These Robert Kraft Merkins (otherwise known as Massage Parlor Merkins) are quickly growing in popularity. Some would say they're "contagious."

**Thang 2**

After a short mosey from one side of the tracks to the other (was really hoping for a train to climb over/under), we made our way to the rock collection at Apex United Methodist Church.

Round 1: Shoulder Burnout (needs a new name) - Includes 10x straight arm rock raises to the front, 10x shoulder presses, 10x clockwise behind the head rotations, 10x tricep raises behind the head, 10x counter clockwise behind the head rotations, 10x shoulder presses, 10x straight arm rock raises. You end with coca-cola pumping through your shoulders.

Short mosey around the church with arms (and other things...aye Big Red) dangling.

Round 2: Colt 45's -- Round 3: Bolt 45's -- Round 4: Colt 45's -- Round 5: Bolt 45's

Tossed the rocks (we hated them by this point) and made our way back to the flag.

**Mary**

One-legged Homer to Marge (both legs) followed by Captain Thors (up to 8 x 32 since we ran out of time).

Have a nice day!

COT: Raleigh CSAUP and praises for healing and Schroeder making his second post. Worth praising, right?

16, out.
