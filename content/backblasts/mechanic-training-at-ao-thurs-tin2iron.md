PAX: Ausfaht, Left Cheek, Zamboni, Bootlegger, YHC/QIC

We did not have a Q so it was up to us to provide for our Brothers. YHC/QIC ask the HIMs to retrieve cinder blocks, KB and weighted rope while I got the tire. We set-up for a tabata crusher. As I was rolling out the tire, Left Cheek asked if we needed a sledge hammer. I replied ecstatically, “ABSOLUTELY!!!”

Before the festivities, we Pledged our Allegiance to Old Glory and did a quick warm up. GM, runners stretch, calf stretch, seal claps, shoulder stretch, and tricep stretch.

Now that we warmed up the right muscle group it was time for the thang.

Thang 1:

5 stations with the tire flip and sledge pulverized as the pacer (flip 5 forward and 5 flips back to start into 10 sledge pulverizers into the tire) then switch. Mosey after each round.

Weighted Rope work

Cinder Block Swings

Modify as needed to work around a nursed injury.

We did 3 rounds with Classic Rock encouraging us in the background.
