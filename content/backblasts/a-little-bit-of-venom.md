QIC: Bartman

YHC was happy to grab a Q spot at Hell's Bells, and even happier to stumble upon some inspiration for the workout on the facetubes. F3 Little Spoon [posted a quick "while your M is off doing top secret bond girl stuff" workout,](https://www.facebook.com/100025053784358/videos/739849480193505/?extid=eBUze3s62uhcK1IV) and while clearly his lifestyle is not typical suburbia, it sounded like a good "while your M is yelling at the kids to get out of bed" material. He dubbed the workout "Venom" for reasons unclear. It doesn't have to make sense.

### Warm-up

Bartman (by way of Pavel)'s warm-up routine:

- Hold your KB in goblet position
- Do a deep squat, use your elbows to wrench your knees apart
- Do 5 curls with the KB #countwithinacount
- Stand up, do 5 slow halos each direction, keeping core engaged.
- Repeato all x5
- 5x [Single-leg Romanian Deadlift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoKjrvJi-Iw) each leg. Y'all, these are so good for your hamstrings..

### The Thang

- 10x back squats with the KB between your shoulder blades
- 10x KB swings OYO. 1-handed if you can. Switch sides each round, or each swing.
- 10x hang/clean/press. Start with the KB on the ground, squat to pick it up. Clean it up to your shoulder, and then do an overhead press, and recover back down to a low hang for the next rep.
- Repeato with 9, 8, 7...
- We ran the pickle, or an extended pickle, after every 3 sets.
- Doing just one rep is silly, so we did 10 for the last set.

### Mary

We finished things out with some KB pullovers, American Hammers, and flutter kicks.
