**AO:** Claymore  
**Workout Date:** 08/10/21  
I scoped out the park on the internet, but arrived too late to scout. With only a couple of minutes to spare, I peppered site Q Skipper with multiple AO-related questions. Hopefully this did not worry him too much.

State the mission, check for FNGs(0), and give the disclaimer.

**Mary:**  
Mixed in with rocks, I think. I don’t remember.

**COT:**  
8 PAX  
Announcements and Prayers

**Naked Moleskin:**  
My favorite part was the rock work. Sharing the lead with the PAX raised the 2nd F factor, and I learned a couple of new moves to boot!  
Pinto is tough! Guy was modifying with pull ups on a tree while we were doing sevens.  
I know on-site coffeeteria is a whole ‘nother level of Site Q effort, but it’s always so nice to have the convenience and the high attendance numbers!  
This was my eighty-ninth #F3Q21 #2021Challenge Q (ninety-third overall). Next Q is Wednesday (tomorrow) at To Be Determined in South Wake.
