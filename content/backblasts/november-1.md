19 Pax showed up to the POGL newest Friday AO. No FNG’s this morning and no time to waste so let’s get started.  
Quick mosey around the lower parking lot and circled up. SSH’s, good mornings, calf stretch, sir fazio, and goofballs were called. Now that we are warmed up let’s begin.  
Most of my Q’s have some sort of theme, so we are going to spell out November. Partner up.

N- No Surrender. Partner 1 does 5 No Surrenders while partner 2 plank holds. Repeato times 4.

O- O.P.P. Mosey to top of parking lot and partner 1 does people’s chair while partner 2 does plank jacks. Repeato times 4.

V- Vacuum Cleaners.  
E- Empty Wheelbarrow- belly up plank walk with partner holding ankles for 5 parking spaces. Switch with partner.  
M- Mucho Chesto. 10 reps each with standard merkin, wide, diamond,stagger left, and stagger right.  
B- Bernie Sanders- backwards run up the parking lot entrance driveway.  
E- Elevens. Mosey to other side of school. Break into stairs. 11 rounds were called but became short on time of 10 reps underdogs on hand rail with a lap around railing and 2 flights of stairs. Run back to flag.  
R- Red Bull Smurf Jacks. 20 cadence count high tempo SSH in squat position.  

Mary- Gas Pumps, and 5 burpees were called as one Pax showed up late.
