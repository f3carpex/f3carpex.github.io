14 men, inlcuding an FNG - Rob Hann - hereafter named Shoe Horn, participated in a fitness event at North Cary Park otherwise known Danger Zone. It was 49 degrees, a little damp and otherwise a nice morning. The group gathered at the flag for small talk. BTW: Several men, perhaps Flacco and Rob were in the the old Site Q’s (me) parking spot. Tighten up.

Warm up lap around the pickle. Backwards run and butt kickers (asses kicked...just like at DAC in Apex).

Stopped at the entrance to the office park. This is precisely where Press On saved my (notice I did not type the three letters that begin with Y) life. He is amazing. We then jogged to the bottom of the hill for a set of hill Jack Webbs. 1 to 4 ratio. 1 at the bottom, 2 at the top and so on. Press On was sporting a Ragin’ Cajun shirt....is that La Tech? So PO counted a set of Jack Webbs in Cajun. After the JW we circled at the bottom of the hill for Plank-a-Rama so we could share a little about how we got into F3 with Rob. Headed back to the Flag with 3 more sets of Incline Merkins on the rail.

Mary. Squatter drove 22 minutes so he led his signature Mary 100’s. Wahoo drove 23 mins so he led a 5 round Capt. Thor. Then I led a few standard Mary moves. LBC’s. That’s its. A spectacular 1.6 miles. Thanks for posting on Strava - Pete Alberse.

Count a Rama, Name a Rama....named Rob - Shoe Horn - cause Hahn. Cole Hahn. Shoes. Shoe Store. Shoe Whore. Shoe Horn. We were almost as good at naming as Dark Helmet.

Closed with a prayer. Micah 6:8 - "You have been told, O man, what is good, and what the LORD requires of you: Only to do the right and to love goodness, and to walk humbly with your God."
