I know we have a newfangled method of tracking workouts with attendance and what happened on slack with PaxMate, but part of me still enjoys typing it out for posterity. Anyway, as Triple Lindy and I were discussing running plans for this morning, I remembered I had a late softball game Tuesday night. It's cool we can just run Friday. And then our boy Happy Gilmore dropped the SNS pre-blast and I was reminded I did indeed have the Q. Awesome. Well, my softball season ended last night so naturally I was convinced to go to the local watering hole for one last bevvy to celebrate the season. Well, 1 turned into more than 1 and before I knew it, YHC was climbing into bed after midnight. Surprisingly I sprang right out of bed when the alarm went off at 0500. I even had tine to go do a little scouting before it was time to get started. Anyway, here's what went down:

**Warmup:** 0545 and there's a couple people I don't recognize, but the only person that says they're new is Liverpool. That guy always has jokes. Quick mission statement and a pledge and we're off to the community center lot. Circle up for:  
SSH x 15 IC  
Good Mornings x 5 IC  
Sir Fazio Arm Circles x 10 IC  
Seal Claps x 10 IC  
Imperial Walkers x 10 IC  
Plank Jacks x 10 IC  
Calf Stretch L/R x 10 silent count each side

**Thang 1:** Mosey back out to the road. Head to the stop sign stopping at each light pole along the way for ascending burpees to 8. When the 6 is in, partner up for catch me if you can to the far lot by the small shelter. When caught by your partner, 4 plank jacks and then go catch them.

**Thang 2:** Starting from the far corner of the lot, double 7s. Start with 1 (L/R) Steve Earle, run to the corner for 5 merkins, then down the other side for 6 Star Jumps. Continue in this fashion adding 1 Steve Earle and subtracting a star jump with 5 merkins each time through the corner.

**Thang 3:** Once the 6 was in, we headed down the hill to the kiosk and YHC called shoulder taps. Burt requested Nipplers instead as it went more with the flow of the mumblechatter at that time so I obliged him. 20 nipplers IC. Then mosey to the rock pile. There seemed to be some concerns regarding the time at this point, but we were good. Everyone grab a non travel rock for:  
10 Tricep extensions  
15 goblet squats  
20 curls  
Mosey to New Hampshire for 20 squats OMD. Mosey back and repeato the first set of exercises. Put the rocks back and head for the flag. Even though YHC consulted with the site Qs, we somehow missed the turn back to the road, but we made it eventually.

**Mary:** Prodigal did us the honor of getitng us going with some flutters. YHC then called some E2K x 10 each side and then finished with Have a nice day.

**Announcements/Prayers/Praises:** Prayers for The Commish's 1.0 as she recovers from her stroke. Prayers for Banjo's 1.0 as he recovers from his recent medical issues. And Praises for Cosmic's M as she recovers from a procedure last week. YHC took us out with a good ole' fashioned BOM. MIAGD!

**NMS:** I knew it had been a while since I Qed a workout on my own. I had no idea it had been since JUNE until I looked to see when the last time was I used my warmup cheat sheet word doc. I will say I have been busy training for various races and whatnot, but so has everyone else. That's a poor excuse. I was just too lazy to put my name on the Q sheet and come up with a workout. I just let the other Pax handle it. That's not how we get better as leaders. Honestly, I feel as though I need to sharpen my Carpex skills as I prepare to take them to the Sandhills. Leading this morning actually felt great and I now remember why I Qed so many times last year, because its addicting. Well that and the Carpex Challenge of course. If you haven't Qed in a while or if you just had your VQ, get back on the Q sheet. I'm already back on next week. You don't get better by letting other guys do it!
