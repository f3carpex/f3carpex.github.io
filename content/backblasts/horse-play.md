Glorious morning!  Moon to start, Sun to Rise!  HOT HOT HOT! With YHC no show a couple of months ago this date was weighing on his mind.  Had to try to make it special in some way. Came in early additional recon everything. Expected to see Sky blue however he was a no show - scared I guess.  Speaking on no shows, Liverpool was a no show, but the interesting thing his 2.0 SpitShine was there to throw down with the best of Carpex! Interesting, I bet he was just really busy.  Back to what was originally stated, great morning! On the track Pivot+ YHC worked on EHing a runner…  

Thank you all for being the influence I need,  No Idea where I would be without you all.
