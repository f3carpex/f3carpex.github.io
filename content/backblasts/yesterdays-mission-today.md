Last week I was in a COP with Repeato, and somehow Chumbawumba's earworm Tubthumping came up. He said "oh yeah, you can do burpees to that song." It inspired me to cook up a Q where we did the three musically-synced workouts that immediately come to mind. I figured my birthday Q would be a good time to debut this.

I was a little aggressive on the "filler material" yesterday, and we only got one song in, much to Hotspot's disappointment. Undeterred, I yanked the Claymore Q from Frisco's starbucky (white-clawey?) hands and sprung my creation on the 10 PAX.

Mosey to the pickle for a quick warm-up (SSH, MC, merkin, Bartmarmorama). 1975 tunes-a-blarin' (in a neighborhood-acceptable way, natch. Don't want too much paperwork awaiting Pickles' return.)

With our heart rate up, head to the tennis court for...

### Thang 1: Tubthumping

Play the song, do SSH, modify to Imperial Walker if needed. When you hear "knocked down," do a a burpee. There are 30 "knocked down"s in the song.

After a ten-count or so, slow mosey to the rockpile for a one-per-customer rock, and do 15x each of curls, overhead presses, tricep extensions, rows. Mosey a lap, repeato with 20-count. Leave the rocks and head to the tennis court for..

### Thang 2: Thunderstruck

Play the song.. slow mosey around the two tennis courts. When you hear "thunder," do a burpee. There are 49 "thunder"s during the song.

Ten-count, mosey back to the rock pile for 10x rock-your-body, 8-count IC. Take a lap and return the rocks.

Back to the tennis court for...

### Thang 3: Sally

Play the song (Flower by Moby). Start in the front-leaning rest, and when you hear "Sally down," go to low-plank hold. "Sally up" to go back to FLR.

I did not count the down/up, but suffice to say Sally needs to make up her mind.

Mosey back to the start

### Mary

Flutter kicks, x45 IC. Have a nice day.

### NMM

That was hard. Harder than I would've done OYO. That's the point. Thanks for being there to suffer together.
