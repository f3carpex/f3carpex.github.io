Measure Twice. Outside of DZ, my most frequented - and most Qed - AO in 2021. So might as well keep that distinction going in 2022! Oh the plans I had this morning. The running ... the trails ... the hills ... not to mention the yoga! Oh the yoga! The PAX were going to be beaten down, broken up and then yoga-glued back together in ways the rest of the AOs could only dream of. The flexibility. The stamina. The endurance. The strength.

But alas, the weather had other intentions.

So we hung out in the shelter, watching the wind push the rain in sideways.

Maybe next time.

ME: dips, step-ups, merkins, dips, burpees, core work. Repeat. Alot. Plus 52 IC SSHs.

Yoga: vanilla stretching.

**COT**: started with 6. ended with 6. Prayers were lifted, especially for back-to-school and those in healthcare. Prayers for our man Schroeder as well.
