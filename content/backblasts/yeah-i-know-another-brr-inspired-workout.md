Denali, bless his heart, he means so well, introduced Bagels (owner of Duck Donuts) and Greenbo to all the other pax. That guy has a heart of gold, and a penchant for making good coffee, but more on that later. Thank you for your leadership. Since there are no FNGs, we are off. Mosey to the HCL America parking lot, hopefully we won’t get kicked out, and do a little warmup, various exercises including runners stretch and pigeon pose.  I believe it’s Grease Monkey’s favorite. Mosey over to the top of Avenue of the Estates. YHC has it on good authority the BRR committee has warrantied and sanctioned the following as part of their official BRR training plan.Official BRR training plan is as follows:

AMRAP continuous loops on Avenue of the Estate hill with AYG on every even number number run up. At the top of the hill, at the gate, 10 balls to the wall presses, modify with CDDs. At the bottom of the hill complete 10 prom night merkins and 10 boat canoes. It seems there are neighbors lacking the same heartfelt qualities as Denali and deliberately foiled our training. We finish the aforementioned on Ederle, going to the fifth light pole. Indian run back to the flag for COT and a few LBC’s waiting on the six. Done.

14 pax  
Announcements: Fourth of July convergence 7 AM, Bond Park. Me thinks there will be an extra credit run announcement as well, stay tuned.  
Prayers and praises: Disco Duck’s M, Kelly. Earnhardt. Chippers friend with heart problems. Two of my girls traveling in Europe. Greenbow and promotion opportunity.

Excellent coffee choice Denali.

Men thank you for the opportunity to serve, Banjo

"No pain we suffer, no trial we experience is wasted.  It ministers to our education, to the development of such qualities as patience, faith, fortitude and humility. All that we suffer and all that we endure, especially when we endure it patiently, builds up our characters, purifies our hearts, expands our souls, and makes us more tender and charitable, more worthy to be called the children of God . . . and it is through sorrow and suffering, toil and tribulation, that we gain the education that we come here to acquire and which will make us more like our Father and Mother in heaven." - Orson F. Whitney
