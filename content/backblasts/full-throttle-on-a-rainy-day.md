"The best laid schemes o' mice an' men / Gang aft a-gley." Since New Year's is around the corner, I thought I'd start off with a quote from the estimable Robert Burns, author of _Auld Lang Syne_. Also befitting since YHC had planned a Q without looking at the weather, and then at 10 o'clock post meridiem, looked at the weather and saw it'd be 40 degrees with 100% chance of rain.  

A mix of cardio exercises, some from the lexicon, most made up, was pulled together by 11. An in-depth analysis for an ad-free & open-source [tabata timer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jbscript.timerapp) was conducted around 5 ante meridiem. The 6 o'clock start was certainly appreciated.

This was the first tabata workout YHC has led, and I enjoyed the pacing of it, plus liked having some time for stretching afterwards. Also my first time posting at Full Throttle, and I appreciated the welcome, as well as the community feeling amongst the Pax there. A great site for a rainy morning, what with the later midweek start, coming-in-clutch pavilion, and mumblechatter!

Post-script: Initially, wasn't planning on writing a backblast, but couldn't let down my audience of 1. So Schroeder, this one's for you even though you didn't post, and also we still have to find a time to practice ðŸŽ¼
