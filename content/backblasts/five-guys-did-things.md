Five men gathered in the dark cold morning of North Cary's finest AO to do things.  If you really want to know what we did, then you could've joined us.  Let's just say it was spectacular.  Moreso was closing down the Q with hearing from each what each man was thankful for.  Couldn't have started the day off better.

YHC out.
