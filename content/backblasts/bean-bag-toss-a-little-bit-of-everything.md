Some workouts seem to focus on one particular thing: today is leg day or arms or abs, etc. I like to do a little bit of everything with a Q, and that's how this morning went at **Point Break**.

Warm-up: started with the mission of F3 and the pledge, then moseyed across the street to a long parking lot. Stopped for several rounds of some quick feet and curb merkins. Moseyed again down to the back parking lot and painted the lines until the end of the lot where we stopped for SSH, GM's, and Hill Billy's.

Thang 1: Bean Bag Toss - we counted off 1's & 2's. One pax from the 1's tossed a bean bag over his should as far as possible into the parking lot. 2's had to bear crawl to the bean bag and back while 1's did burpees. Then pax switched. Another round with crab walk and LBC's, and final round with broad jump and WWII's. After 3 rounds YHC could tell from Francois's complaining that it was time to change things up.

Thang 2: We moseyed to the parking garage area under the office buildings for 3 rounds of sprints: 50% run 50% of the way, then 100%. Ended each run with 3 burpees.

Thang 3: Went into Waverly Place where the fountain is. We split up 1's and 2's again for social distancing and each group went to a stair-way. We did 10 rounds up the stairs and back down with merkins at the top and squats at the bottom counting down in reps from 10 to 1. After that we met in the middle and each group took a turn doing derkins while the other group ran a lap.

Then it was back to the flag for freddy merks, hand release merkins, and 10 burpees OYO to finish it.

COT: TCP Sawgrass this Sunday, sign up. Prayers / Praise: prayers for Snips' family his MIL passed away unexpectedly Monday night; prayers for kids returning to school; prayers for Oofda's trip to Arizona w/ the family.

Thank you, fellas, for the opportunity to Q. It's always a privilege. Make it a great rest of the week!
