It was cold.....  
We had blocks.....  
We had 80's Rock.....(See NMS for playlist)  
Let's do this.....  
  
With a starting temperature of 22 degrees, there was no time to hang around. Today's workout was meant to move quickly and keep moving.  
  
18 PAX, No FNGs

**Warm Up  
**After a quick Pledge of Allegiance, it as time to get the blood flowing and temperature up.  
  
Two loops around the parking lot then a circle up  
SSH \* 15  
Sir Fazio \* 15 forward and backward  
Good Morning \* 10  
15 Squats  
Left/Right Calf Stretch  
15 Merkins OMD/OMU  
20 Plank Jacks

**Thang 1 - Hill Work  
**Pax double timed over to storage shed to retrieve cinder blocks.  
Blocks transferred to the top of the hill to be used in 11's.  
Star jumps at the top of hill.  
Run with blocks to bottom of hill (with blocks held overhead).  
Burpees at bottom of hill.  
Lunge walk back to the top (with blocks held overhead).  

**Thang 2 - Obstacle Course  
**Blocks lined up in two rows, 10 feet apart.  
PAX divided into two groups to traverse the blocks.  
Group 1 does bear crawls while Group 2 does crab walk.  
Flap Jack so everyone gets a change to negotiate both obstacles.

**Prayers  
**Ausfahrt recovery  
Dave's family recovery after Joanne's death  
Swags M  
Snots M  
Close friend of Imp  
Spartain took us out

**NMS  
**Without the motivation of F3, there is absolutely NO WAY YHC would work out at 5:30am at 22 degrees. Thanks men.  
The PAX did a good job of moving those blocks. You certainly don't need a gym and a monthly fee to work out.  
The most disturbing event of the entire work out was when the Rock Legend, Mr. Bob Seger himself, was rocking out to Hollywood Nights over the blue tooth speaker. A PAX comment of "Is that Foreigner" came from a middle aged PAX who should have known better.....Red Ryder took great offense. YHC just shook his head. What do you do with that.....  

Play list:  
Nickelback - Rock Star  
Ozzy Osbourne - Crazy Train  
Kansas - Carry On Wayward Son
