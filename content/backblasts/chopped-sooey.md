QIC: Chops!

14 Pax are right on time. Pledge, mosey, warm up at Dude Solutions.

Thing 1: Indian Run for a mile around the lake.

Thing 2: Three-man DORAs in the Chiesi parking lot. Partner one handles the DORA (100 merkin, 200 lowslowflutters, 300 squats), partner two runs across the parking lot to relieve partner three. Partner three is monkey humping.

Thing 3: Pearls on a string back to the flag. We pass the 3 mile mark.

Mary, COT: announcements (signups opening soon for Carpex golf tournament) and prayers/praises (school uncertainty).

10 for a long coffeeteria at NYBIII.

NMS:

Tclaps to Wax for posting 3 straight days after getting named on Tuesday.

Great to have LaLoosh at BiB.

We really need to stay out of the road when doing plank exercises.

A Regency homeowner was yelling at us from his back deck about mowing his lawn. Strange.

Next week YHC has the Q.
