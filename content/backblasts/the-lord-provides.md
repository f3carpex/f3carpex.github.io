The last few weeks at Hell's Bells has been great as we've been pushing 20+ PAX several times. The issue this creates is we are always on the edge of having enough bells, and the site Q's (Lindy and I) are working on getter more bells (Send Money to Lindy's Venmo @Joeldangerfield if you can help, $5 goes a long way). Fortunately, the Lord always provides, this time in the form of cinder blocks.  
  
0530 start on time. Only two PAX 30 seconds late, pledge and quick mosey around the parking lot. Warmup was side straddle hop, imperial walkers, sir fazio forward, seal claps, sir fazio reverse and inch-work merkins plus 15 penalty burpees (Trike said him and Water Wings were worth more than 5 each).  
  
**Thang 1:** KB exercises AMRAP while two PAX grabbed cinder blocks and did 15 man-makers between them. Once they were done we recovered, and the next two went, so on and so forth. Every fourth exercise we'd take a quick mosey around the parking lot.

- Squat Thrusters
- Merkin with Bell Touch
- KB Swings
- Rows
- Goblet Squats
- Around the World to Curl

**Thang 2:** We got through all of the exercises with about 15 minutes to spare, and when I began to repeat them there was an "observation" made by some of the PAX we were repeating exercises. I decided to call an audible of partnering up and 50 pullups/100 manmakers as a team. The PAX were quite excited especially Theismann who cannot wait for IronPAX next fall (not kidding). When everyone finished a quick Mary with Red Ryder doing dying cockroaches and Captain Thor.
