This week has been crazy. I am a day late in writing my backblast. Monday I found out one of my work friends died over the weekend. My volunteer work has picked up. Deadlines in my day job. And yet Crimson brought up the fact that Tortoises didn't have a Q and I felt compelled to put my name on this Q sheet. I did not really plan the workout. I did not have the time to do it. But yet I did. I got more out of it than I expected and I've Q'ed a fair amount of workouts.

Sometimes we need to remember we have more to give to those around us. Sometimes that we have to remember when we are helping light other peoples way we are also lighting our path.

So here is what I think we did. It was yesterday morning. I've had a lot going on. I was tired. It was early. But yet we did it (at least this is how I remember it).

5:30:30 realized I was late starting since we were getting out some kettle bells I had just decided we needed.

Pledge and a quick jog around the parking lot.

Warm up:

- SSH
- Good mornings
- Merkins
- Mountain Climbers
- Sir fazio
- Some other stuff

Mosey around to the flag.

Thing 1:

- Dora: 100 Merkins, 200 Squats, 300 LBCs. Jog around the parking lot.

Thing 2:

- With your bells - 20 curls, 20 presses, 20 tricep extensions
- Bear crawl 1/2 the parking lot
- Repeat bell exercises at 15 count
- Lunge 1/2 parking lot
- 10 lawn mowers each side, repeat bell exercises at 10
- Bear crawl
- Rock your body - 15 count

Jog the parking lot - you have energy to keep going even when you are tired

- Bubba hang in there buddy. God has a plan.
