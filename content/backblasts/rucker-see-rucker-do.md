Rolling Stone 2/15/18 at BO

YHC had a plan for Rolling Stone today, I swear.. but I also had a feeling that it might be a good day to join Banjo. And so it was.

While the rest of the group paired up to complete sets of 100, the three of us split up the work in thirds. It seemed a fair trade with the addition of 30 (or 45) pounds. Tip-o-the-cap to Term Paper/Breathtaker getting in on the spirit of the ruck. Among the stops on our tour:

- Mericans
- Squats
- Burpees, which we did a few of, but modified to overhead press
- A bunch of parking deck stuff

Good 1st and 2ndF, fellas.
