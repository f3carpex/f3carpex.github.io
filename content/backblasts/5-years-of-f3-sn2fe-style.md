As many eye rolls and sighs of exasperation YHC received last night for, arguably, emphasizing the "DA" in HIDA with this Q, it was gonna happen.

Not to get all sappy with y'all but there is very little I can say I have been doing - and loving - for five years and running. Yes, the 1st brings us out but truly it is the 2nd that keeps us coming ... and growing ... and building off each other. Living 3rd is important, truly, I get it. But you still need that personal push, that love, that drive to make sure you live 3rd with all you have.

I was going to try and list some of my favorite memories but was worried I'd leave something out. Thank you all for helping shape the man I am. I'm hopeful a few of you feel the same way.

**Warm-up:**

- Merkin stretches: 10-20 merkins broken up by calf stretches and runners lunges. 4 sets
- Sir Fazio, GM, Squats, IW, Windmills

**Thang**

Keeping the mileage to a minimum as I had knee surgery later that morning, we keep things simple. The idea is to alternate between an active exercise and a recovery one. Fact of the matter is, I think the 'active' was a welcome break from the 'recovery'.

In a circle, do 1 rep of an exercise Mexican-wave style while the rest of the PAX 'recover'. Repeat with 2 reps, 3 reps and 4 reps.

- Merkins & High Plank hold
- Burpees & LBCs
- Something... & Supermen
- Merkins & Squats
- Boat canoes & 100s / Flutter kicks

In the middle there the runners were given an opportunity to do a lap around the Tortoises pickle while the non-runners stayed behind for core exercises. First time ~70 IC LBCs. Second time ~10x IC each of LBCs, H2Heaven, E2K.

**COT**
