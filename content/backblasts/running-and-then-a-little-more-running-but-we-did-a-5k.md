The rain stopped, the temperature stayed warm-ish, and the wind died down for 6 pax to run some 11s, Hills, and a tour of downtown Apex.

3 for EC (2 for ECP and 1 for EC) - YHC, Hanson, and Yogi

0530 - Yogi gave a disclaimer schooled us on the mission and 5 core principles of F3

The mission of F3 is to plant grow and serve small workout groups for the invigoration of male community leadership.

F3 Workouts...

- are free of charge
- are open to all men
- are held outdoors, rain or shine, heat or cold
- are led by men who participate in the workout in a rotating fashion, with no training or certification necessary
- End with a Circle of Trust

Made our way over to the pool in down Apex and circled up in the parking lot.

Continued on to Thales and circled up:15 SSH, IC

**Thang 1** - 11s and Hills and Quick Feet

- Ran over to the back parking lot of the Apex Baptist Church and complete a grueling 11s of Burpees at the bottom and Squat Jumps at the top of the lot.
- To make sure our legs stayed fresh we did a 25 count quick feet and then off to the next Thang

**Thang 2** - Grab your Partner - Round and Round

- Partner 1 - Run the Pickle
- Partner 2 - Mountain Climbers (2:1)
- Sub out and Partner 1 does Mountain Climbers and #2 Ran the Pickle - 100 Mountain Climbers Total
- One more Dora - Partner 1 ran the Pickle and Partner 2 did jump lunges - Sub out and do one quick round.
