13 pax weren't about to let a little rain stop us from enjoying this beautiful morning.

**Warm-Up** Mosey to the end of the lot and circle up for daisy pickers, hillbillies, Sir Fazios, copperhead merkins, copperhead squats and control freak good mornings.

**The Thang** Mosey from the south entrance to the north entrance with two merkins at each light pole.

Continue our mosey to the big, beautiful soccer field. Using only half the field mosey to each corner for ten squats, with a return to the center for three burpees between corners. Repeato with LBCs in the corners and dry docks in the center.

Partner up at the handrails outside the fields, one partner alternates 10 irkins and 10 Australian pull-ups, other partner runs to the shelter for 10 step-ups.

Mosey over to the pond via Bear Crawl Bridge (temporarily renamed Ain't No Way I'm Calling Bear Crawls Today Bridge), one partner does rock rows, rock curls and rock presses while the other runs around the pond.

Bolton complains about the abundance of running so lunge walk up the hill with ascending squats every four steps.

Mosey down to the shelter for irkins, dips and step-ups, then back to the place where the flag is supposed to be.

**Mary** Go around the circle until we run out of time.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  13 **Name-a-rama**:  3 RESPECT, 9 meh, 1 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for everyone travelling this weekend, prayers for families of members of the military who gave their lives to serve our country. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**  We had two FNGs this morning, Mr. Safety's 2.0 Kendyl and Shipyard's BIL Dan.

Kendyl is an actress and gymnast and got the name Swifty for a previous role in a play, and for the way she lapped the QIC a couple of times.

Dan is an interesting guy, he's a wood worker and artist who just moved to North Carolina after living in both New York and Florida. He got the name Garbarge Plate because he's from Rochester, home of the garbage plate, home fries and macaroni salad covered by a hot dog or hamburger (or both) minus the bun. My mouth is watering just typing this. You can get it at Peak City Hots in Apex, see you there soon.

Love you guys!
