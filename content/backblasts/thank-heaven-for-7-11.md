## Preamble

Well the last time I worked out was the Krispy Kreme challenge almost 2 weeks ago. I've been doing some fantastic smart sacking (missing the 20's and a good bit of rain) but my knee is feeling better than it has felt since July, so I was excited for this morning. But then I slept terrible, seriously, the night before the Q is like the night before a flight. I swear I wake up around 20 times to make sure I didn't oversleep. I had a dream that I was on time, early even, for the ME but went to the wrong AO. . . and I had a cooler full of water I was dragging around. What does that mean? I don't know, but I shot up like a bolt at 4:55 when the alarm went off and hit snooze. But I really got up at 5:05 and got in gear. I was so excited to see my brother Slappy who HC'd to my preblast, but apparently he decided to work out to some soft core pornography he found online, but Frisco also HC'd and he wasn't there. . . so I take the good with the bad. We all missed you Slappy!

## Introduction

- Disclaimer
- Pledge of Allegiance
- Mosey for 100 yards, to the first dry spot big enough for all of us, on your six
- Stetch our legs out: 30 seconds pull each knee to chest, 30 seconds pull knee to opposite shoulder, 30 seconds stetch each hamstring
- Some nice slow good mornings, really slow . . . .
- 10 Burpees to prove that even men who stretch are tough
- Mosey up to Apex BBQ, back around the front of the church to the parking lot

## 7-11s

So we will never finish 7 actual 11s, so here are the rules, mosey up and down the hill, start with 1 mosey to opposite side, do 2, mosey to opposite side, do 3, etc. When you are done pick up the 6, squat hold, plank or something like that. A few 10 counts in there

1. American Hammers
2. Bobby Hurley's
3. Carolina Dry Docks
4. Diamond Merkins (I think at this point Smithers and Bambi finally quit sprinting, show offs. . . )
5. Freddy Mercury
6. Gorilla Humpers
7. Hill Billys (High tempo at this point trying to finish by 6:15, high tempo hill billys with runs in the middle suck, remember for later)

## Almost Finished

- Mosey back to the flag
- Have a nice day!

## COT

- Yahoo VQ tomorrow at Hot for Teacher
- Smither's co-worker Lynn having knee surgery
- Wahoo's friend Steve suffered heart attack when he was with him in the gym on Monday
- YHC took us out in prayer
