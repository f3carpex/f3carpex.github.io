Great title, stole it from Duck's Slack post.

31 on the Steve, raining and a bunch of junk on the ground after some early December snow. Purrfect.

Warm-up:

- After a quick huddle up to set expectations, we're off.
- Mosey into the park, ensure footing is secure, run up the street.
- Circle up for stuff.

The Thang:

- Get a partner for partner 11's on the hill. Basically just 11's but handing with another dude. Squats at the bottom and merkins at the top.
- After the 11's mosey to the lot for quick feet and curb merkins, run a lap, repeato, run a lap, repeato, run a lap. At some point the six was called to the front and penalty burpees were handed out for running in front of said six. It was fun, Hi-Liter got to run a lap while the pax amrap'd burpees at one point. Fun, indeed.  
    
- Get back with that partner for catch me if you can (CMIYC) with 10 squats at the exercise of choice. YHC launched snow balls at the pax throughout.  
    
- Circle of pain with YHC, Hi-Liter and Chipper on merkins, squats, and LBCs (oh hey wet parking lot).

Mary:

- Finish up with the circle of planks and some superman's at the end.

Announcements; see slack. Prayers were lifted up in including Sooey on travel, Crimson on surgery, and Ausfhart (more updates to come).

NMS:

- Cold, wet, rainy, snowy... no better place to be than the Gloom with my bros.
