COT

Rush Hour has hands down the best COT location in all of Carpex.  We moseyed over to the small fountain nearest the parking lot, took off our shoes and sat with our feet in the water for a nice long while.

NMS

The great thing about Rush Hour is the group is usually pretty small and there's usually no rush to leave afterwards, which makes it easier to have deeper and more intimate fellowship.  Banjo and I spent some quality time getting to know each other better, and talking about Shut-in's reminder to pick up the six.
