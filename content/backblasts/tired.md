This is going to be short. Sorry fellas. I'm beat.

Kids are out of town still so last night the M and I went to dinner at Hank's Dive Bar in DTC. It's not really a dive but the drinks are good and the fried cauliflower is fantastic. Recommended. I had seen Chewie walk by the window earlier in the evening so as we were leaving I gave the place a bit of a scan to see if I would spot him. I didn't and thought not much of it. As we get to the car, however, my wife gets a text from Crisco saying she and her other half (Red Ryder) just saw us leaving Hanks and if we would be interested in a drink with them. SideBar it is!

All of this has nothing to do with Piranha Park. It's just cred for the fact that we did something more than just sit at home watching HGTV while the kids were gone.

We did watch an episode of Better Call Saul though. Later.

So on to today. I'm getting ready for this Raven Rock 100 Miler and know I need miles on the bike. But because Squatter is in charge of all things bike related (when Hermes is out of town only, of course) the ride is planned for Sunday, not Saturday. So I'm on my own apparently.

Fine. Q at Piranha Park is open, so I sign up and check how far it is. 13 miles. Perfect.

Out of the house by 5:50. One red light otherwise a flawless ride down to the other side of Apex. Arrive before 6:45. Perfect. Get out of my clips and put on a fresh shirt. Tights stay on. It's Nature Boy time!

**Warm-up**

Run the cul-de-sac non-pickle and stop for some GM, SSH, merkins, calf stretches, wide-grip merkins, MC and Plank Jacks. Hands are hurting so recover.

Mosey to the stage for IW, squats and something else. Run off's keys fell out. Time to fix that so mosey back up to the cars to drop those off. Squat hold and something else while we wait. Back down the hill.

**Thangs**

Grab a rock at the bridge. Stationary. Partner up. Partner 1 runs the lake with stops for 10 pull ups (or until you drop) and 10 diamond merkins along the way. Partner 2 AMRAPS with the rock. Four laps, four rock workouts: curls... rock presses... tricep extensions... rock rows.

Awkward moment as YHC gets down for the merkins and a pony tail jogs by. I think my tights were tighter than hers. Hellos were exchanged.

When everyone is done 8 8-ct rock your bodies to wrap things up.

Mosey to bear crawl bridge for ... bear crawls. Squat thing (see Ragnarok BB here: **https://f3carpex.com/2021/07/10/mosquito-joy-at-the-rok/**). Crab walk back down the bridge. Repeato on the squat thing. Mosey the longer way back to the green way. We saw the same guy a couple times. He did not join in.

Did some sets of 20x derkins, IC step ups, dips on the ampitheater retaining wall. Mixed it up with some D. Lo's and Downward Shakiras. I did not like those.

Finish up with **Mary** at the shelter:

- 20 IC H2M
- 20 IC Freddy Mercs (with singing)
- 20 IC L/R heel touches
- 40 IC flutter kicks (someone said 20 was my number)
- 18 IC LBCs
- 21 IC dying cockroaches
- 10 IC superman
- 10 IC aussie snow angels
- 10 IC B2 Bombers

I think that's it.

**COT:**

- 10 (more 30 yos than any other age group)
- Announcements went on forever! Blame it on Earhart. TCP... Lowes food... Oct 2 pig pickin'... Oct 10 10-year anni. Christmas Party. We cut him off before 2022.
- Prayers for Texas Ranger's family and all the PAX who recently lost a friend, a coworker or someone else they loved or knew

**NMS**

- Ate a cereal bar and a peach and back on the bike. Added another ~30 miles heading home. Chatted with High School Musical on Yates Store. Got home and emptied the garage of six years of sh!t.
- Tired. Going to rest up now.
- Ok... it wasn't that short.
