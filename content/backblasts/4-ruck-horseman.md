QIC: WWW

PAX: Ezekiel, Katniss, Lawn Dart, WWW

Bartman sent a post on 1stF channel stating that he was going to make the traveling Rolling Stone AO a permanent AO. The AO of choice to share the real estate was none other than Gran Torino. Unfortunately, the post also was Q shopping because Bartman had to travel this week. As soon as YHC saw the post, I immediately jumped at the opportunity to sign up to Q. If you have not tucked before, it is something that needs to be on your F3 bucket list.

I sent out a preblast yesterday letting the PAX know, there was a ruck option to the HIGH INTENSITY beat down that Shutty has planned for. Katniss was the first to HC. No others have made notice to HC. I arrived waiting for the start and my boy Ezekiel gets out of the warmth of his vehicle with Lawn Dart exiting the passenger side. I asked if he was going to GT and he said emphatically “NAW ... not going to do no running just rucking Brother!”. Katniss strolls in 4 mins to start.

Before heading out, we pledged to Old Glory. Off we went.

Warm-Up

4 Ruck Horseman warmed up on the route. We get to stage 1. Since our legs were warm, I need to get the shoulders warmed up in understanding of what I had planned. Circled up at the mouth of the Preston circle and did Sir Fazio (forward and back), air presses, seal claps, and lastly, overhead claps. No on to the thang.

Thang 1

Light pole to light pole:

Wolverines x5

Sumo squats x15

4 light poles done.

We continued our ruck route down Preston Parkway.

Thang 2

Dismounted our rucks to use as coupons:

WWII with a press x10

LBC x10 IC

Mount up boys to continue our journey along Preston Parkway. Stopping at the corner of Davis Drive we circled up for Thang 3 - lunges x10 and 5 rounds of Jack Webbs. In the interest of time and getting back to the flag on time, 5 is all we could do.

Back to the flag we go at a brisk pace. However, we switched partner so each PAX has a chance to get to know each other.

Back at the flag with the GT PAX we’re finishing up, I called merkins on my up and my down until it was COT time.

NMS

Preston Village is a great place to ruck. There are multiple options with mileage to get after. You will definitely not have any problems with a route. Great choice Bartman on picking the spot to call Rolling Stone home.

It was a pleasure to lead the Rucker’s. I will definitely do it again.
