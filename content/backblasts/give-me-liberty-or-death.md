With all the spirit and having experienced the 1776 beatdown personally, I felt one more inspirational workout was due to the PAX.  With everyone there on a hot and muggy morning, we head out running out and back, circling around the Nan-tan for the first group of exercises and:

## Warm Up

10 **G**ood Mornings

20 **I**mperial Walkers

20 **V**ariable Side Straddle Hops

15 **E**levated Heel Raises

 

15 **M**ountain Climbers

15 **E**levated Heel Raises

 

## The Thang

Finish warmup, mosey over to the field for the next round of the theme, all centered on merkin exercises:

**L**unge walk, merkins across the field, basically left, right lunge with a progressing number of merkins

**I**ncline merkins, PAX on the hill with a clock theme, 5 merkins per each 15 minute increment

**B**roadjump **B**urpee back across the field

**E**xtended arm merkins, 10 each arm

**R**anger merkins, 15

**T**ravolta merkins, 10 each arm extension for 20 total

**Y**our choice merkin, 20 reps

 

Finish with the liberty merkin challenge, we head to the shelter for the next round of the theme:

With time to spare, Q takes the PAX over to the tennis courts for some suicides, because what is liberty without sacrifice.
