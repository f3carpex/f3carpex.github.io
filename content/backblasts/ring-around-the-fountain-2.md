A bold PAX of 25 posted this AM. As Coxswain came cruising in at 05:44:59, the PAX proceeded to the newly erected Town of Cary downtown park fountain and circled up around the fountain. The men were blown away at its beauty and the Q drowned out by its constant flow of running water.

Warm-Up: 20 Merkins 10 Good Mornings 20 Side straddle hops The roar of the fountain was so intense that the Q had to audible off of his invisible wenke and ordered the PAX to Academy street for an Indian Run/Hunt for the rock pile.

The Thing: The PAX grabbed their favorite non-traveling rock and headed to the church parking lot. 20 tricep extensions Run to the portico and back 20 curls Run to the portico and back 20 shoulder extensions By this time the whining of the PAX was heeded to and we lunge walked across the parking lot with rock extended over head roughly 100 ft. 20 rock rows Lunge walk 100ft back to other side of parking lot 20 curls Run to the portico and back

Return rocks and mosey back to the flag.

Mary/Dora: We combined Mary and Dora into a perfect combo of 100 Low Slow Flutters, 200 JLo's, 300 LBC's while partner ran to flag at top of hill for 5 celebratory burpees

COT: All 25 PAX survived despite mentions of B.O. becoming a high tempo workout...
