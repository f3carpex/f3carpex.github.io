Day 3 of 5 for my anniversary Q needed to match the previous two days groaning from the PAX, however we wanted to ensure that PAX were following WH guidelines to stay away from each other. Therefore, we adopted the “40 Minutes of Hell” Nolan Richardson. Named after the famed basketball coach from University of Arkansas.

Warm up:

Good Mornings

Windmills

CAC

ME:

The Nolan Richardson is a very simple routine, however it is necessary to split into partners (NO TOUCHING!!!!!). Unfortunately, the PAX evenly set up and left YHC to try to tackle the routine solo. The routine has the below in it:

150 Burpees

300 Squats

150 WW2’s

300 Arm Circles

150 Merkins

300 Lunge Jumps

While one partner does the above, the other PAX would backwards run 50 yards, and regular back to the partner. Given the numbers, Nature Boy and his 2.0 teamed up for the routine, Doggy and Ezekiel teamed up. The PAX gave the 40 mins all they could but ultimately we had to cut the lunge jumps for time with Mary.

Mary:

Frog Crunches

Ski Abs

COT:

Continued prayers for the country and men of F3

Welcome FNG The Rock!
