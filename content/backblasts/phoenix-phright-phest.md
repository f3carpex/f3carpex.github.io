Nine men got together for Halloween festivities at Phoenix on Saturday. Glad at least one person got dressed up!

It's too bad he was late...

### Warm-up:

Eight men started off with the Pledge at 6:30AM. The parking lot was mostly empty, save for the approximately 793 sundry signs in Red, Blue and Yellow. Early voting closes at 3PM today so it's going to be a busy day.

After the pledge, we mosey out of the parking lot towards the big field just as a car comes rounding the corner. "Loom", someone says, recognizing the driver.

Eight men circle back to the pickle to pick up the ninth.

Change of plans. Mosey to the activity center parking lot via the alternative route for:

- One penalty Thriller Burpee.  
    Realize that Loom has come as the Identity Thief and represents 16 others personalities.  
    Penalty burpees accordingly adjusted to seventeen.
- Ghoul Mornings
- Jumping Jack-o-lanterns
- Plank hold for Grave Escapes
- Scarecrow Circles
- Pumpkin Pickers

Hi-Liter entertained the PAX with pointers for how to effectively escape a cheap pinewood coffin. Solid questions from Tecumseh regarding details of moving arms and removing shirts. We discovered that if its a fancy padded coffin, you're toast.

### Thangs:

#### Misery [Ankle Breakers](https://youtu.be/tURhk-5mDpE)

Starting at the bottom of the parking lot, run to the first parking spot line, stop, back to the start. Repeat to the next line. Repeat all the way to the second island. Breathtaking.

#### Rocky Horror Picture Show

Mosey to the dam and the rock pile there. Pick up a horrifically big ego rock.

- 6 IC [Here's Johnny's](https://youtu.be/WDpipB4yehk?t=76) each side
- 20 Ripley [Chestbursts](https://youtu.be/AdBu6VAESeI?t=83)
- 10 IC rock [Saws](https://youtu.be/7bmB4RhsYgQ)

Rock [Carrie](https://youtu.be/zOcZgcs6l3A?t=144) to the bottom of the stairs. Leave your rock out of the way.

#### Spider Webbs

Up at New Hampshire, set of 1:4 Peter Parker Merkins : 4 Flying bats

10 sets

Back to the bottom and repeat the **Rocky Horror Picture Show** in reverse.

Mosey to the big field up against the hill

#### [28 Days Later](https://youtu.be/c7ynwAgQlDQ?t=12)

28's up the hill. Burpees at the top (start at six, increasing by 1s), squats at the bottom (start at 24, decreasing by 4s). [Ringu](https://youtu.be/G3kiwpnO7RU?t=74) crawls up the hill, mosey down.

Mosey back to the flag following the trails around back.

### NMS

As we were moving through Bond Park, Torpedo took a moment to point out that his father, who loved coming to Bond Park, has a memorial bench placed in his memory. Thanks for sharing Torpedo. It's a beautiful spot.

Lots of enjoyable mummblechatter this morning. Thanks to this group of men for the company.
