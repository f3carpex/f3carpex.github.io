#COVID19 is now officially in full hysteria mode. I mean that in the "uncontrolled" and not "exaggerated" sense of the term since who knows if the hysteria is warranted or not. But considering that the NBA just suspended their season... and travel from Europe into the US is blocked... and America's Dad (or whatever we are calling Tom Hanks nowadays) is not in quarantine in Australia as a result of COVID... well, the shite has gotten real.

But this morning at SNS, we were pre-hysteria. Sure, TP and Purell are not worth more per gram than Sudafed but it was still light-hearted craziness.

So YHC decided to have a little bit of fun and put together a musically-themed COVID workout for the PAX. I enjoyed it. I hope the PAX did as well.

### Pre-SNS:

YHC, Flip-Flop and Schroeder enjoyed a nice 40 minute Insomnia session to warm up. Fun conversational pace was run. Learned a fair amount about my man Schroeder who just recently moved to lovely NC from less lovely Manhattan.

Back at the SNS parking lot in time to grab my phone and speaker to get going with The Cure.

One of the weirdest Cure videos. And that's saying something.

Turns out Saban is a Cure fan.

### Warm-up:

Just in time for the announcement, tune #2 comes one. Perfectly timed musical transitions by YHC. Prize for the first PAX who picks up on the musical theme for today. Flip immediately guesses 47 incorrect things. Some may become themes for future soundtracks. Not gonna lie.

We listened to the clean version. Enjoy the NSFW masterpiece here.

Jog to the baseball field parking lot for:  
\- 10x GM  
\- 20x SSH  
\- 20x IW  
\- calf stretches  
\- 20x merkins

Somewhere in the midst we were joined by Huey.

Time to move towards the main event.

### Thang

Expertly pair the PAX up. YHC is odd-man-out. We will be practicing social distancing while modifying BLIMPs:

C is for Chasing Rabbits (IC)  
O is for Overhead Claps (IC)  
V is for V-ups  
I is for Imperial Walkers (IC)  
D is for partner Derkins (10 each on the flip-flop)

PAX 1 starts with the COVID above (100 total of each) while PAX 2 runs to the 1st baseball field and back. Flip flop with PDs as above.

Somewhere in there Flip-Flop finally earned his prize on his 2,783th guess.

Is this the kind of video Bon Jovi was making fun of?

This is when the dog walker chose to come by... Sorry!

Most of the PAX are done now. Time to mosey back.

I think it is a crime that the Disturbed video has 15x more views than the Ramones

Someone made a crack that the speed here is reminiscent of YHCs bedroom perfomance. The length isn't too far off...

Pause at the SNS dam rockpile for 20x merkins and some squats.

Not a PAX favorite judging by the MC. Too bad. It's a great song.

The least viewed of the videos on this playlist. And one of YHC's favorites. The Crow Soundtrack has featured in two other Pierogi Qtracks to-date. Expect at least two more.
