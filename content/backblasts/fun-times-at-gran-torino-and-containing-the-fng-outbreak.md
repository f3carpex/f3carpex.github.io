I have to prepare for this Q because this AO attracts all the runners. Disappointment is out of the question but it does worry me. When you have Carpexrunning legends like Largemouth, Old Maid, Ma Bell, Hi-Liter and the soon to be up and coming you got to put together something that will challenge them. I had a strategy but it was going to be put to the test.

Normal F3 admin since we had an FNG and a pledge of our allegiance to Old Glory, since it is flag day.

Quick QIC world record mosey and circle up for warm-up.

GM, Sir Fazio (F&B), Air presses, Moroccan night clubs, seal claps, overhead claps, calf stretch with merkins.

Welcome FNG Outbreak.

Picking up the 6 is why F3 succeeds because we leave no man behind and we leave no man where we found them

Trying to start a new tradition in COT ... I heard it on PU6; #6 PAX reintroduces himself to the group and provides a personal testimony on what they get out of F3 and what brings them back. I hope it sticks.

Truly blessed to be around great men.

Truly honored to serve you!
