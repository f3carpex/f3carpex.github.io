I went to bed Tuesday night hearing on the news that Wednesday AM would be glorious. The weather reporters were correct and we had amazing low 60's for the starting temp and no humidity.  Arriving a bit early for a personal EC, I returned to see a gaggle of HIM eagerly awaiting the start.  With no FNGs and a short disclaimer, we did The Pledge
