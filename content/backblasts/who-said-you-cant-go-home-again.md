It was a glorious start to fall and a great day to be out in the gloom. What a better place to start the day than at Field of Dreams. Hard to believe that it has been over 4 years since Ma Bell and YHC started this AO.

Today - one of my goals was to prove that you don't have to always run up the hills to the top parking lot in order to have a proper beat down. Accordingly, I decided to keep us close to the flag. I was also in the DC area over the long weekend and was inspired by the convenient store of my youth so part of our workout was a tribute to the best convenient store chain not named Sheetz or WAWA.

Clock indicated 545 (and Pigeon was out of his car) so we were off - it didnt matter that Spit Shine was still pulling in - rules are rules. Run around the large lot and over to the small lot where we circled up for - GM, MC, Plank Jacks (thanks Sky Blue), HB, IW (thanks Sooey) and over to the curb for some Quick Feet.

The Thang - 7s - Star jumps and LBC, quick intermission to run to other parking lot - and some more quick feet and then

11s - Merkins and Squats

Then partner up - one get a rock - one to the pavilion - alternating sets of dips, ALRSU and irkins in pavillion - and curls, tricep and OH press with the rock - flap jack - three sets each - 15, 12, 10. Return rocks and over to the basketball court for suicides, bear crawl, crab walk, duck walk, Peoples chair and BTTW.

quick mary of H2M and WW2s and we were done.

Announcements - various - (including Krispy Kreme run in february) with not a lot of details - please check slack.

Prayers - IR - liverpool and Badlands, Crimsons family, liverpools - sister in law

YHC took us out.
