An even dozen found their way to the lower parking lot this morning which seems to be the only place we can start Hells Bells now. The top lot is always locked. No Pax were late so Red Ryder was disappointed we didn’t start with burpees.

Warm-up – Everyone picked up a traveling bell and moseyed over the the parking lot. Warmed up with SSH, Good Mornings, calf stretch, and followed by sir fazio forward and backward.

The Thang – Time to partner up. P1 ran to the circle and back while P2 did renegade rows with a merkin mixed in. And switch. Once all Pax arrived back at start, time to mosey as a Pax to the circle. P1 ran to top of hill and back while P2 did kettle bell swings. And switch. All Pax now mosey to top of hill. P1 ran to 2nd light and back while P2 did lying floor presses and overhead presses. and switch. All Pax mosey to light pole. P1 ran to exit of park and back while P2 did goblet squats. And switch. All Pax mosey to end of park. P1 ran to parking lot and back while P2 did side bends and core rotations. And switch. All Pax mosey to picnic benches for a round of Urkins/merkins/derkins. Mosey to parking lot for Pax choice of Mary to take us out.

Mary – we had a good 7 mins of Mary and can’t remember everything.

Circle of Trust - thanks to Intimidator for leading the prayer.
