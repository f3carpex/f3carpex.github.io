I couldnâ€™t have asked for a better morning to host my first Q, along with Squatters help. We did have an FNG, so the pledge was recited, F3 Mission and disclaimer. The only running of the morning was a quick mosey around the lot and then circled up for our warm-ups.

**Warm-Ups**

- Side Straddle Hops
- Good Morning
- Abe Vigoda
- Cotton Picker

**The Thang #1**

- Bearway to Heaven- bearcrawl 2 parking lot spaces followed by 7 burpees, mosey back to start line, bearcrawl 4 parking lot spaces followed by 6 burpees, continue until 0 burpees remain.
- Thunderstruck- Plank hold for entirety of song. Complete 1 merkin (32 in total) for every "Thunder" in the song.
- Baba O'Riley- 5 straight minutes of Imperial Walkers.
- Bodies Hit the Floor- Plank hold for entirety of song. When song says "Let the bodies hit the floor" do a donkey kick (26), when the song counts do a merkin (21).

**The Thang #2 - Partner up and mosey to grass and pullup bars**

- Exercise #1- Partner 1 does Walmart Burpees x5 while Partner 2 does pull-ups. Flapjack. Exercises done to Rollin' by Limp Bizkit and My Body by Young the Giant.
- Exercise #2- Partner 1 does Mickey Mouse Merkins (Wide/Diamond/Wide), 15 in total, while Partner 2 does Left Right Step-ups. Exercises done to One Step Closer by Linking Park and Whatever it Takes by Imagine Dragons.

26 HIMs were present for my first Q. Welcome FNG Pinto! Prayers were requested for Frisco's M, Parker's FIL, and PBX's mother. At this time we were joined by a special guest, and my first time meeting him, Ausfart. The PAX gathered around Ausfart as he led us out in prayer.
