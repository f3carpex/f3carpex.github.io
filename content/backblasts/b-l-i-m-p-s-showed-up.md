4 pax gathered in the evening gloom for another Tues night beatdown.  So after the disclaimer (which YHC always seems to butcher for some reason) and the Pledge of Allegiance we were off and running to the grass next to the parking deck.

**Warm up**:

- Good Evening
- SSH
- Windmills
- Steve Earle
- High Knees
- Turkish Getups

**Thang 1**

After Indian running back to office buildings where we started, we partnered up for the first thang. P1 did Balls to the Wall, while P2 ran down to a specific rail and did 10 Australian pullups and WWII’s, ran back then switched.  Repeato with P1 doing People’s chair.  Round three P1 did 10 count BTTW, while P2 ran down the stairs to 20 quick feet and 20 dips, ran back then switched.

**Thang 2**

We moseyed over to the parking deck, using all levels of the deck we did BLIMPS at each turn. Burpees, Lunges, Imp Walkers, Merkins, Plank Jacks, Squats. (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30).

**Thang 3**

At the top of the parking deck, we 31 calf raises then ran to the other side and down the stairs.

**Thang 4**

After moseying to our favorite grassy area, we planked in a line. The first guy did 5 pullups while the others planked, then each guy would take a turn at it.  Round 2 was the same the pax did LBCs AMRAP while waiting at their turn at 5 pullups. Round 3 one pax did 10 pullups or till they maxed out, while the rest did monkey humpers AMRAP.

**Thang 5**

20 irkins at one brick wall, backward run to the opposite wall and do 20 dirkins.
