Music starts at precisely 540 with Enter Sandman to get the PAX pumped to work hard.

27 strong and we are off about 20 seconds early.

Mozy meander through some trails until we get to a good warm up spot.

If you aren't on GroupMe, sign back in and check out the McCants Memes. They are at his request and I know that they are good medicine for him.

Did my first Slack Poll this week in order to gauge music interest for this Q. In all reality, unless something dominated, I was going to play 80s rock (ish) stuff. I was surprised to see Justin Timberlake have so much popularity. Googled “best JT songs” and after listening to all his top 10, I was definitely not feeling it for an F3 workout. But did decide I would throw Sexy Back on the playlist. When I saw Swag arrive, promptly deleted it, because I am pretty sure that they drop some F bombs in it. Also did include an 80s funk and country song.

Ma Bell, apologize for not giving better placement to your Bob Seger request of Ramblin, Gamblin Man. I was way behind you in in the Indian Run and did do my best to get closer to your group, but ran out of steam.

It was awesome to see Compound W and Blue & Out again. Both had been recently mentioned as MIA, so kudos to the PAX that got into their ears.

Welcome back to Hot Lips as well.

If you think of any guys who used to be regulars, be sure to reach out and see if you can encourage them to return.

Thanks for all of the encouragement today. I think we had fun and worked our tails off. Always an honor and a pleasure to lead.
