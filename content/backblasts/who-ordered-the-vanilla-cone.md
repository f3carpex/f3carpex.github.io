As one of the site Q's of this AO and a huge kettlebell advocate for working out, I took my time in coming up with a somewhat complex workout for today. Mumblechatter was high today as the Pax were trying to learn many new exercises introduced for the first time today. Let's get started!

Warm-up- Mosey around the pickle and circle up for some extremely slow Good Mornings, SSH's, seal claps, and calf stretches. Too excited for the workout to begin so that's enough stretching.

The Thang- Here's what we did. Grab your bell of choice and circle up.

1. Single Arm clean to squat to rotational press. 10 reps each arm.
2. Pull thru Merkins- essentially drag the bell from one side of your body to the other and do a Merkin- 20 reps.
3. Around the world to a curl. 20 reps.
4. Bird dog rows on picnic bench with a tuck jump, 20 reps.
5. KB Overhead hold lunge walk the parking lot and back.
6. Mosey over to side of church and picked up the 15lb slam ball. Pax in a line holding peoples chair while moving down the line first Pax did a wall ball throw followed immediately by a burpee. Bring the ball back to start and same thing except for Balls-to-the-Wall hold.
7. Back to your bell for LBC's with a Homer-to-Marge. 20 reps.
8. Deep squat with a curl, stand to an around the world stopping halfway for a tricep extension, complete the world, back to squat. 20 reps.
9. Pullovers to WW2 with bell. 20 reps.
10. Hollow body presses. Lean back as far as you can and do single arm presses. 10 reps each arm.
11. Mosey to pull-up bars. Whatever combo you want to 15 pull-ups and 50 KB swings.
12. Kneeling bottom up presses. 10 reps each arm.
13. Mosey the parking lot and do whatever KB exercise you want. Around the worlds, curls, tricep extension.
14. Circle up for Mary- American Hammers were called, Frisco called Merkins, Freddy Mercury, and a new one that I called; Side to Side V-ups which we placed the bell at our feet, leaned back and swung your feet over the bell from side to side.

Announcements- Convergence for Thanksgiving, X-mas party.

Prayers & Praises- Huckleberry and Quiver.
