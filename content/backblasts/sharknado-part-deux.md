**The Sharknado** - it has become YHC's favorite circuit routine next to the Murph in recent years, and has become the official benchmark test of downtown Apex's finest AO, Bounty Hunters.  The idea is to test your endurance abilities 3 times per year to see if you are making incremental improvements, and also...because its Thursday.  (hopefully not infringing on any trademark laws surrounding The Maynard's slogan)

Warm-up run from the flag to the Apex Town Hall courtyard, circle up

It was a pleasure to lead another Sharknado, and very cool to see everyone really getting after it!  This workout is a beast, avg heart rates probably in the 160's and 500+ calories burned easily.
