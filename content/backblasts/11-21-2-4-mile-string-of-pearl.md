19 pax for a 2.4 mile loop stopping at about 5 spots for some pain stations. Joe Smith led us for some Homer to Marge work at the LDS parking lot. We did some pull ups at the playground, a 10 count down the line inverted sunrise over US1, we finished with some one-arm merkins at the flag.

Â 

Great work men! Dice gave us some great guidance on what F3 means to him. I really enjoyed it fellas!
