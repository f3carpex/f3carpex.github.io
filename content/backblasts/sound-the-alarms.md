6 pax made it out to Rush Hour, the finest place to be on any given Tuesday evening. YHC made it out a little early to scout out a couple of obscure places. So as the start closed in, everyone had gathered to do a little stretching, as Press On got in some pullups. Once 6:00 hit, a disclaimer was given, the Pledge of Allegiance was recited, and we were off!

**Warm up:**

We ran to the open space in between the two railroad lines, and circled up for:

- **Good Evening**
- **Daisy Pickers**
- **Sir Fasio Arm Circles Forward**
- **Overhead Clap**
- **Sir Fasio Arm Circles Reverse**
- **Plank Jacks**
- **SSH**

**The Thang:**

YHC found this routine on the Exicon called ALARM (Arms, Legs, Abs, “R” exercise, “M” exercise) and decided to make it my own.

_ALARM 1, (10 reps):_

Grab a rock from the pile (side note, they were much heavier than they looked..): **OverheadPress, Rock Squat, American Hammers, Rock run** to a set point and run back, **Merkins** with one hand on your rock then switch.

_ALARM 2, (15 reps):_

Stay with your rock for: **Curls, Rock Lunges, Homer to Marge, Rock Rows, Merkins** with both hands on rock. Then run over to the front of the bank on Academy St.

_ALARM 3, (20 reps):_

**Irkins, Box Jumps, LBC’s, Raises** (Calf Raises), **Merkins** in declined position. After that we continued advancing down Academy St to a very small parking lot.

_ALARM 4, (25 reps):_

**Shoulder Taps, Bobby Hurleys, Dying Cockroaches, Russian Dips, Mtn. Climbers.** When finished, we ran toward the church for #5.

_ALARM 5, (30 reps):_

**CDD’s, Prisoner Squats, Pickle Pounders, Run** backward (or forward to modify) around a set point, **Moroccan Night Clubs.** Done. So it was time to cross the street to make our way back.

We did a slow Indian Run back, stopping a couple of times to do some **Burpees** and **Planks**.

**Mary:**

**Supermans**

**COT:** 3 Hate, 2 Meh, 1 Respect

**Prayers/Praises:** For all injured pax: Term Paper, Build-A-Bear, Liverpool, and Pierogi’s MIL. For everyone affected from COVID-19, as well as with everything going on the protests and riots.

YHC took us out.

**NMS:** I was actually planning on letting us dip our feet in the fountain, but I decided to hold off because of the graduate having her pictures taken up there. Just thinking they’d probably not want us in their background.. Anyways, Congrats to her!
