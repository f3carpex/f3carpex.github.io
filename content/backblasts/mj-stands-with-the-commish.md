**NMS**

- We discussed the Bible's exhortation to make the most of every opportunity. We celebrated the fact that so many men show up at a workout like Phoenix to do just that. YHC admonished everyone to give their best every chance the have.
- YHC also challenged the veteran Qs to EH a man who has never Q'd to get him going. We took a show of hands for all who need to VQ.
