When my Wednesday go particularly difficult to deal with at work, I texted my M and set a plan for the evening. After dinner, we would take the family out for a special outing to a new bubble tea place on NC State's campus. After all, they have this new 'cheese foam' topping that has the internets all abuzz. I have a strong stomach, how bad could it be?

Rolled through town this early AM to scout out a new spot I wanted to visit with the PAX. I found it, but of course, had to make a pitstop at the HT (see NMS for a CRITICAL note about that). This was not the typical pitstop. I texted the site Qs alerting them of the impending substitution need... and then drove to the AO and started it anyways.

FNG Check / Mission / FOLLOW ME

Run down to the Cary Arts Center for a warmup. Something like GM / IW / TT / SM. Follow me down Kildare. We going mobile today.

Follow me neeeeearly all the way to Maynard, past some sleeping cops, through the former site of K-Mart to a sketchy wall. We've reached our destination - Rose Street Park.

Partner Up - One partner paints the lines and does 10 cadence quick feet. Two partner does a suicide on the basketball court and does LBCs until One partner returns.

Follow me out towards Maynard. Circle around to the front of Los Tres Magueyes. One partner does Dips while Two partner bear crawls to the first island. Do it twice, then lets do the journey home,

Stop a couple times for some Mary along the way and mosey into the flag area at 6:32. Needless to say, that's it.

NMS

All of the bubble tea and every curd of cheese foam came out at RSP. All of it. Everywhere. It rivaled AKA's spewage at DZ last year. I felt like a daggone million bucks once it was out though. That lasted till I got home. I laid in bed for the rest of the day.

Harris Teeter is closing from Midnight to 6am. This seems to be omnilocational, since even the one by my house, which I thought for SURE would stay 24/7 (it's the Western/Jones Franklin one), is observing that change. If you have any leads on a pre-work out recovery place, I need those details ASAP.

I just found out as I was confirming location names that the neighborhood that houses RSP is called Burtrose. Look at that.

That's the second overtime Q in a row for me (46 min, 47 min). The good news is that my next one is at Phoenix. Need to get better there.

We have limits and I found mine today. Thank you for dealing with me, that was super rough.
