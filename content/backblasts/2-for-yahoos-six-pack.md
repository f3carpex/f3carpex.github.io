Since there was some discussion on Mumblechatter as to what constitutes a six-pack, the Rush Hour executive board, Kermit and YHC, has officially given Yahoo 2 workouts towards his first six-pack. We previously proposed that any workout that has a "feels like" temperature over 90 should count as two. Well, it was feels like 94. If you would have seen Yahoo wring his shirt out after, you would give it to him as well. It left a large puddle, we didn't even use the fountain. This can be resolved on Mumblechatter. Maybe you can give Horatio a good place to get pimento cheese.

**NMS:** Great group. Tried to slow Kermit down with a kidney punch, but couldn't get close enough. We EH'd a dad with his young daughters in a stroller that was enjoying the campus and was doing a some merkins on his own. We'll see.  
No 2ndF after. Too dehydrated.
