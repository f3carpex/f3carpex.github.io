Terrific late spring morning.  Low 60s.  Dew Point of 45.  Couple of Shovel Flags planted.  21 of CarPex's dudes came to Danger Zone to get stronger.   At 5:35 there were only 2 cars in the lot...one of which was in my usual spot.  Not a big deal since it was Tecumsah who is relatively new to Danger Zone, but not F3.  He is a beast.  At 5:45 20 dudes were ready to roll and then in rolled Marlboro.     We were off.  No music today, YHC is trying to focus on getting better at running workouts.   Simplify.

- Merlot was spilled.
- Flouride and YHC hit up coffeteria at Starbucks.
