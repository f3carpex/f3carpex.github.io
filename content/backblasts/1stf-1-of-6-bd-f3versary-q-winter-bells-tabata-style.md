PAX: EarharT, WWW (YHC/QIC)

Day 1 of 6 for my birthday and F3'versary week.  I was not so sure Monday would even happen coming off the tail-end of 8" of snow and rain all day Sunday.  I woke up at 0400 hr wondering how it would be outside.  I stepped out at O'dark thirty to test out the ground.  It was wet but not frozen.  I got ready wondering who would show up.  I arrived at 15 mins to start and the gates were still closed and locked.  As the time ticked away, still no Park & Rec workers to open the gate.  5 mins prior, Earhart shows, still a no show for Parks & Rec and no other PAX.  0530, it is confirmed that it was just EarharT and I to get our exercise on.  We grabbed two bells each and farmer carry them to the shelter.

**Warm-Up**

Hamstring stretch, calf stretch both calves, merkins, Sir Fazio (forward and reverse).  A little mumblechatter from the PAX ... it was deafening.  Actually, excellent 2ndF convo.
