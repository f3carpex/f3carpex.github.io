**Pre-Blast**

- 34 HIM rocked SNS and Vespers this fine AM. Honored to lead, fellas. Thank you for journeying with YHC.

**The Warmup**

- Pledge of Allegiance at the flag
- Disclaimer
- Mixed Run to the Community Center
- Paint the Lines (except Kitty)
- Circle up for: Good Morning, 10 Burbees OYO (because no one was counting), Windmills, SFAC fwd, OH Clap, SFAC bkw, Moroccan Night Clubs, Merkin Series (on my up and down, 1 leg up, etc.), SSH

**The Thangs**

- Choose a rock that will rock your body and a partner who rocks
- Dora 1-2-3: 100 Rock Your Bodies, 200 Australian Nipplers, 300 Freddie Mercuries while your partner runs a lap around the Community Center
    - YHC called an audible...rather than L/R is one for the Nipplers, let's go each one is one. YHC heard from a PAX, "Yeah - I was going to do that anyway." #heardatF3
- Plank series: 1 arm and 1 leg up, etc.
- Run to the kiosk
- Sprint the Hill (x3)
- Mosey to the line, AYG to the flag

**COT**

- Welcome FNG's, Pepsi and War Eagle.
- What a group today...strong, strong work.
