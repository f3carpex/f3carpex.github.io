Joining Carpex, my first post was Dante's Peak. That following Monday Grinch took me to Wolverine. So it was only fitting that I reached out to him to see if he was ready to come off the Injured Reserve List to be part of my first Q at Wolverine. He was! Welcome Back Grinch.

And thanks to Hi-Liter for bringing breakfast this morning to celebrate the lightest day of the year.

I didn't have to dig too deep into the F3 Exicon to find this little gem, but now I know why I haven't seen it yet. Meet the Stink B.O.M.B.S.

**Warm Up**

We grabbed the flag and Moseyed over to the large soccer fields where I had already put out 5 cones. We planted the flag in the middle and started with: Arm Circles, Windmill, Imperial Walker and Mountain Climbers.

**The Thang**

Partner up... Partner #1 stays at cone #1 and begins with "B". Partner #2 runs to the flag in the center for a little extra, then returns to the cone, switches with their partner and repeats until they get the total number of reps. Then move on to the next cone.

So you know the B.O.M.B.S. (but we increased the reps)

100 Burpees 150 Overhead Claps 200 Merkins 250 Big Boy Sit-ups 300 Squats

And we added the "Stink." At the flag, doing 50 reps of the following

cone #1 - LBC cone #2 - Boxcutter cone #3 - Freddy Mercury cone #4 - SSH cone#5 - Low Slow Flutter

The consensus seemed to be that 50 was a lot for Box Cutters and 250 is a lot for anything, but especially Big Boy Sit-ups.

What? We still have time? OK, let's go for a 1/2 mile lap around the soccer fields.

Just enough time for a set of 100's and Have a Nice Day.

YHC took us out with a reminder to _"be the coffee bean."_

> A young woman went to her mother and told her about her life and how things were so hard for her.  She did not know how she was going to make it and wanted to give up.  She was tired of fighting and struggling.  It seemed as one problem was solved a new one arose.
> 
> Her mother took her to the kitchen.  She filled three pots with water.  In the first, she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs, and the last she placed ground coffee beans.
> 
> She let them sit and boil without saying a word.  In about twenty minute she turned off the burners.  She fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl.  She pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl.  Then she ladled the coffee into a bowl.  Turning to her daughter, she asked, “Tell me what you see?”
> 
> “Carrots, eggs, and coffee,” she replied.
> 
> She brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots.  She did and noted that they were soft.  She then asked her to take an egg and break it.  After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg.  Finally, she asked her to sip the coffee.  The daughter smiled, as she tasted its rich aroma.
> 
> The daughter then asked, “What’s the point, mother?”
> 
> Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same adversity… boiling water – but each reacted differently.  The carrot went in strong, hard, and unrelenting.  However, after being subjected to the boiling water, it softened and became weak.  The egg had been fragile.  Its thin outer shell had protected its liquid interior.  But, after being through the boiling water, its inside became hardened.  The ground coffee beans were unique, however.  After they were in the boiling water they had changed the water.
> 
> “Which are you?” she asked the daughter.  “When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond?  Are you a carrot, an egg, or a coffee bean?”
> 
> Think of this:  Which am I?
> 
> Am I the carrot that seems strong, but with pain and adversity, do I wilt and become soft and lose my strength?
> 
> Am I the egg that starts with a malleable heart, but changes with the heat?  Did I have a fluid spirit, but after death, a break up, a financial hardship, or some other trial, have I become hardened and stiff?  Does my shell look the same, but on the inside am I bitter and tough with a stiff spirit and a hardened heart?
> 
> Or am I like the coffee bean?  The bean actually changes the hot water, the very circumstance that brings the pain.  When the water gets hot, it releases the fragrance and flavor.  If you are like the bean, when things are at their worst, you get better and change the situation around you.
> 
> When the hours are the darkest and trials are their greatest do you elevate to another level?
> 
> How do you handle adversity?
> 
> ARE YOU A CARROT, AN EGG, OR A COFFEE BEAN?
