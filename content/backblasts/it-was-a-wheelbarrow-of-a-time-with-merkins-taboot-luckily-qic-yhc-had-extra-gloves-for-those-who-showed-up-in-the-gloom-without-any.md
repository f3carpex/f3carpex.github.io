PAX: Butt Fumble, **Cataracts,** Chicken Little, FNG Dreamliner, Frisco, Glow, Headroom, Oxtail, Prosecco, QueeQueg, Qwerty, **Shipper**, Slappy, Smithers, Taxi Driver, Wahoo, **WWW**

The morning was beautiful with a comfortable 70 degrees. As the PAX showed up, I asked those who did not have any gloves as they stepped out of their chariot, why no gloves? Luckily, QIC/YHC was prepared and handed those without gloves extra gloves that I did have. I had enough.

We did have an FNG in our midst, so we went through the F3 administravia stuff and Pledged Our Allegiance to Old Glory.  Of we went on a SLOOOOWWW mosey to the other parking lot to warm-up.

Warm-up: GM, Hamstring stretched, Abe Vigodas, calf stretched, CFMs x 5.

Here is the reason for the gloves. Thang 1 is parner wheelbarrow or deviously named Wheel-kins 5-5-5. 5 steps, 5 merkins for 5 times. Flapjack with partner but before partner 2 does his wheel-kins, there were 50 buddy squats to be done. Once completed, partner 2 starts his set of wheel-kins. Repeato for round 2. On round two, replace buddy squats with buddy monkey humpers.

Thang 2: Burpee escalator: 5-6-7-8-9-10. In between each set of burpees, run / walk to other pickle corner. QIC calls out a PAX to lead the group in the burpees.

Thang 3: Dips AMRAP while partner 2 runs the pickle for 3 rounds.

Thang 4: Quick hands 15IC + 10 irkins. This like quick-feet but with your hands. PAX in plank position facing the curb. QIC calls the cadence (4 count exercise).

Mosey back to flag for a round of Mary around the circle PAX favorite x 10 reps.
