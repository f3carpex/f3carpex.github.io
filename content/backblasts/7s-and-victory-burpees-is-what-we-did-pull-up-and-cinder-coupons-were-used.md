AO: Tortoises

Date; 12/18/19

PAX: Ausfahrt, Bubba, Chanticleer, Doogie , Ezekiel, Freebird , Fridge, Hotty Toddy, Intimidator, Quiver, Rooney, Traffic Cone, WWW

 F3 mission, core values and credo cited. Pledged Our Allegiance to Old Glory and off we go into the wild blue yonder around the pickle and back to the flag to warm-up with Ausfahrt. You heard right, Ausfahrt is out in the gloom and looking awesome. He is not using his cane. Excellent progress.

Warm-up: GM, Sir Fazio, shoulder stretch, calf stretch with CFM/Eskimo Merkins/diamond merkins x5.

 Mosey over to our typical hill for the thang.

 Thang 1: 7s - Plank Destroyer and ABC to G. Once the 6 is in, bonus burpees. Mosey to pull-up bars for thang 2.

 Thang 2: 7s - pull-ups and dips. Once the 6 is done, victory burpees. Mosey over to get our cinder-coupons for thang 3.

 Thang 3: People’s chair with modified wonder bra x10 IC. Staying PC and putting the coupons down, 10 count down the line. Rest to ease the tension in the quads. Repeato once again. Ok, so using cinder blocks to do wonder bra was not a good idea. Those things get heavy quick after doing so many 7s. But what do they about an exercise, if you can’t do it, don’t Q it.

 Slow mosey to put the coupons into YHC’s truck for future usage this week. I likes me some coupon work.

 Circle up for Mary. QIC calls 150. Close it out with PAX favorite Mary until time.

 COR: 13

NOR: a few Respects, mehs
