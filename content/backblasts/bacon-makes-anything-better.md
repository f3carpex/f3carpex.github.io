50 merkins in warm up was impromptu decision to honor respect week. Grumbling started as we passed 20, got stronger as we blow by 30, followed by complete onslaught of complaining from 40-50.

Apologies to Sega and Meatloaf for “too much information” regarding my hangover this morning including some off-color language. The workout was just what I needed to get over it.

Hope all enjoyed the bacon. If you aren’t aware, Harris Teeter breakfast buffet open every morning and you can load up on quality cooked bacon at a bargain price. Saves in fridge for a couple of days.

Coffee hit the spot. Thanks Oofta

Love you guys
