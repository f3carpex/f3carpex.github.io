It was cold. The morning started at 0500 for an EC run by 3 of the aforementioned best. When YHC showed up at 0505 for EC pull-ups, they were long gone, and it was just me and Bob Seger for pull-ups and Merkins. Dumpster Fire showed up just in time for the two of us to get some quality 2nd F time in and go for a Â½ mile warm-up run. See first sentence.

When the EC runners got back and 7 other PAX who showed up for the finest high intensity bootcamp workout in NW Cary on a Friday, YHC was staring at some of the best. I mean top of the Strava leaderboard, marathoner, May May regular, BRR running, fast af best. That's a lot of pressure for a meh, bro. Fortunately, Gran Torino doesn't have the stringent Q vetting process like Kryptonite and Whiplash. So I was able to sneak in under the radar.

Anyway, let's see if YHC was up to the test.

**The Warm-up**

Run around the front of the school, around the two drop-off loops, back past the flag, and over to the shelter for:

- SSH IC
- Say Hey Willies IC
- Cotton Pickers IC
- Lunges IC
- Bulgarian Split Squats (one leg forward, back leg on bench) IC
- Irkins IC

**The Thang**

Run around soccer field path, stopping at each corner for escalating exercises - **1st corner**: 5 burpees. **2nd corner**: 5 burpees, 5 star jumps. **3rd corner**: 5 burpees, 5 star jumps, 5 merkins. **4th corner**:  
5 burpees, 5 star jumps, 5 merkins, 5 squat jumps.

Continue on across the back of the school, up to the road, and over to the Circle on the Green for a Solo Dora. Do 10 Merkins, 20 LCBs, and 30 Squats, then run the loop. Repeato x 4 for a total of 50 Merkins, 100 LCBs, and 150 Squats and 5 runs around the loop.

Run back down the road to the school entrance and down the driveway hill. Stop there and turn around. Sprint up the hill to the stop sign and mosey back followed by Pamela Anderson's IC. Sprint up the hill and mosey back, followed by Dying Cockraches IC. Sprint up the hill and mosey back, continuing on back around the front and side of the school to the flag. Back in time for 4 minutes of...

**Mary**

Circle up for Flutter Kicks, Scissor Kicks, Copperhead Merkins (signature move), and Hundreds (Squatter signature move).

**NMS**

- Did I mention it was cold? I mean there were more tights at GT than a Carolina Ballet production of The Nutcracker
- Nut cracker, heh heh, snicker, snort
- Layers started getting shed during the Solo Dora. At 23 degrees, YHC accepted that with a knowing smile. Challenge met
- There was a noticeable lack of any wind. The fart YHC left at the shovel flag before departure was still there when we got back for Mary.
- 2nd F at Starbuck's afterward was excellent
