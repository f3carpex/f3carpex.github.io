Does anyone else have problems Tagging names in this Wordpress? I crank through the list of pax hitting the enter key after each name and inevitably about 25%-50% are mysteriously deleted. How irritating is it that in 2020, there is not a technology available that allows someone to simply create a blog post. At least that dadgum Yosh thing is gone. I guess you get what you pay for.  
  
Alas, i think 2 were there for the EC run and 17 were there for the main event. Pledge of Allegiance and follow me...  
\- Warm-Up in grocery store parking lot. Good Mornings, Hill Billies, Merkins and Calf Stretches (aka Cat Scratches) were done.  
The Thang:  
\- Partner up, catch me if you can jog with 5 merkins to top of Cary Pkwy hill to US1. At the top of the hill, the Q asked everyone to go back for the 6. Several guys decided to just stand around instead.  
\- Jog across US 1 to the office building parking lot, 10 penalty burpees for the aforementioned standing around while we wait on the 6. 
\- Jog to the church with the well lit front parking lot on the right at Seabrook. 40 LBCs in cadence.  
\- Jog down to McDonald Woods Park for some irkins, derkins and dips.  
\- Jog down to the basketball court for some more LBCs.  
\- Jog down to the wood bridge to no where to see where Trolls live.  
\- Jog down the greenway to the concrete paved switchbacks at the US1 bridge for a classsic Largemouth special - Triple Nickels. - 5 Merkins at the bottom, 5 merkins at the center of the bridge, 5 merkins where the concrete ends on the otherside and Repeato.  
\- Meet up in the middle of the bridge for the best Inverted Sunrise in all of F3 Nation.  
\- One long Indian Run (aka Washington Run) back to the flag for an 0615 arrival.

COT - 17 pax, 1 respect, 16 meh.

Twas an honor to lead all you leaders this morning!  
If you are planning on going to Kryptonite on Monday, you should change plans. If you are going to be there, you will most certainly need the following: old running shoes, a headlamp, a machete and a survival knife. Okay, only 2 of those are actual requirements.
