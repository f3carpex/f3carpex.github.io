**…Now tell me what ya gonna do, When it ain’t nowhere to run (haha, Shut-in reminded me of this Bone Thugs-n-Harmony song and I think I’ll start my next Q with this in the background)**

**F3 started for me in Churham at The Falcon approximately two years ago, later spending 1 year as Co Site Q at Tobacco Road. After moving from Durham to Cary 1 year ago this month, I was past due for my first Carpex Q. The Carpex Pax are a lively bunch, full of mumblechatter and banter, it’s great, glad to join such a fine group of men.** 

**THE WARM UP:**

Burt hooked it up with a ‘merica tank top for the workout, looking fresh, thank you sir!

Jog to the Cary Community Library

Mix in high knees, high heels, karaoke and side hops

Circle up around the “Butt Wave” (as informed by Hermes along the jog, he was right)

SSH 15x IC

Do the wave

Low plank hold, counterclockwise, high plank hold (3x around)

Tuck jump, counterclockwise, (2x around)

**THE THANG, STREETS OF CARY:**

Jog to the Cary Downtown Park, partner up

Partner A Bear crawls counterclockwise around the water fountain

Partner B Burpees AMRAP

Partner B Bear crawls counterclockwise around the water fountain

Partner A Burpees AMRAP

Repeato, swap Burpees with WWII’s

That was the intention but there was some confusion (bad YHC direction) so we did something close to that.

Jog to the Cary Arts Center, stairs out front

Partner carry up the stairs, walk back down, alternating partners, 5x each.

Shut-in helped ease the stairs chaos by suggesting we go up the sides and down the middle.

Jog to the bottom of the hill behind/beside the outdoor amphitheater

Jacobs Ladder, run to the top of the hill, burpees at the top

(1 up 1x burpee, 2 up 2x burpees and so on up to 10) – unable to grant audible request at the half way point by Term Paper, nice try!

Plank hold for early finishers

Grab a piece of the wall near the top of the Jacobs ladder hill

Dips 15x IC

Irkins 15x IC

Derkins 15x IC

Jog back towards the BO site meetup

Mix in high knees, high heels, karaoke and side hops

Sprint at the turn back to finish line

Circle up, Merkin pyramid up to 5 and back down.

**MARY:**

10 mins left, around the horn, Pax choice, 15x each exercise IC

Pet Sounds was tired of Mary and finished us off with some Catalina Wine Mixers. Several disgruntled Pax on this one. Left immediate bruises on my forearms, smashing concrete to grind it out, Aye!

**COT/MOLESKIN:** Lots of announcements couldn’t keep track of all event names and dates…Bulls Game, Odyssey, etc…GroupMe is a great place to stay in-the-loop on this so ask someone how to get signed up for that App if you want to stay better connected.

Prayers went out to Miltary family members, Surcharge family, and missing Pax with babies on the way. All unspoken prayers lifted up.

 

**Enjoyed it Carpex, see you next time in the gloom!**
