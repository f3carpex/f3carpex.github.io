With the Tobacco Road Half and Full Marathon approaching, the pax joined for what has quickly become an annual tradition... well at least for this second year in-a-row... a long ATT run followed by top-notch fellowship in the parking lot centered around the all-time champion of breakfast meats, BACON.

Distances varied between 5-16 (based on YHC's count), with the majority of pax locking in on that 10-mile distance. Dang near purrfect with the race coming up in 10 days.

Pax ran.

Upon finishing up, the pax were greeted by a pair of HIM cooking up breakfast, our Nan'tan Ma Bell and the 2nd F support crew of Riptide. Tclaps to Ma Bell for man'ing the camper stoves and to all the pax who brought supplies for the morning including bacon, eggs, dranks, donuts and some awesome polish baked goods.

Simply, this is peak Carpex culture, great 1st F followed by even better 2nd and 3rd.

COT: 27 and Shut-In took us out

NMS: Until next year... BE THE BACON!
