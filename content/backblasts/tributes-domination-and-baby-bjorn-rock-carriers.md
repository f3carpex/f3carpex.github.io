So this week, YHC drives past at least two other closer AOs, down Kelly Road to Thomas Brooks park, the site of Field of Dreams. A very expansive site it is, with lots of options to travel. Therefore, we ignore all that extra space and stay within 200 yards of the flag at all times.

It seems FOD is trying to take on an SNS feel, with lots of running opportunities that are either EC before the workout, or are done in place of the workout. Cars are everywhere at 0525, but no actual PAX around. YHC does some EC pull-ups and laps around the lot, and soon Beaker joins in. A few minutes later, more cars come in, and Trike has convinced his neighbor to join. One FNG, it's 0545 so the F3 mission and disclaimer is given and allegiance is pledged.

## Warm Up

Mosey across the street to the parking lot adjacent the shelter, do a lap with some high knees and karoaoke. Circle up for 24 SSHs (RIP Kobe, one of the all-time great competitors), Moroccan night clubs, overhead claps, Steve Earles, Plank Jacks, CF Merkins, and Good Mornings courtesy of Nature Boy.

## The Thang

Everyone head to the rock pile and pick a non-traveling rock. Move back to the parking lot adjacent the shelter. Five rounds of:

- 10 Manmakers
- 20 Overhead rock presses
- 30 rock squats
- Run the pickle - which is the big parking lot across the street, and back to the starting point, but stopping at the shelter OR playground each time for 5 pull-ups

Following the final round of exercises, PAX are led on a Nature Boy lap and 5 more pull-ups. Return the rocks and head to the basketball court.

## Mary

Captain Thor up to 10:40, Have a Nice Day

## COT

25 which includes some of the non-Vesper runners - at least one Hate and several Respects. Welcome FNG Side Car, who overcame the obstacles called being Trike's neighbor to make it out for a good workout. Several prayer requests, including our brothers Cataracts and Liverpool who are on IR. YHC took us out.

## NMS

- Squatter was cradling his rock like a baby - it was impressive.
- Don't let Ezekiel pick the rock, if you're doing partner work.
- Dirty Bomb talks a LOT.
- Some of the runners joined for COT, and others seemed to be avoiding us for some reason.
- FWIW, Roy Williams is now 36-4 against NC State, and 31-4 as head coach of the Tar Heels.
- Shut-In faced up to the above fact like the HIM he is.
- The primary reason why YHC believes Kobe Bryant was such a great player was that in addition to a great work ethic, he had a killer instinct. Always ready and willing to take the big shot, and never backing down.
- MIAGD and be better than you were yesterday!
