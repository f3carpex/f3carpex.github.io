YHC was moderately concerned when he realized that he was DP Q the morning after the Beer Mile. For the record, that was some nasty ass beer (thank you Mich’s daughter), at least the 3rd and 4th were. Thankfully, I woke up feeling great and my long warm up would go off as planned, instead of high numbers of good mornings and windmills followed by an extended Have a Nice Day/naptime. Franklin was hoping for the Pax to hide from Monkey Nut. I guess it was successful, since we didn’t see him until 6:27, although we really didn’t try to hide. Rotary’s lunge walk form may be better than Nabisco. The temperature had to be 65 and Nature Boy still had his full leggings, long sleeves and earmuffs Yogi was looking ripped and like a bad ass in his compression shirt What happened to downtown run commuters this morn? Borland had some awesome shoes 2 more FNGs! For the record, I didn’t get their info, but Bocephus works with Ma Bell and Earhart, so he should be in good hands. Snots (Eddie’s dog from Christmas Vacation in case you are curious) is a friend of Water Wings and he certainly knows the drill for getting FNGs plugged in. Thanks for the encouragement Grease Despite feeling great, I was still able to foul up the expected count, recover call outs, and the cadence on multiple occasions. But none of that is new. Always an honor and a privilege to lead!
