A half dozen for the pre-run and a full dozen for the main event showed up at Koka Booth Monday morning to start their week off right. YHC was accused of "being mean" multiple times during the workout, but then was also told it was my "best Q of the day." Not sure which, if either, of those is true, or maybe both. I'm confused but maybe this will clear things up...
