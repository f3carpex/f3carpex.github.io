It seemed simple enough. Run around Bond Lake and stop and do exercises every tenth of a mile.

I'm just not sure where my calculations went wrong.

Was the warm up too long? Was the PAX too slow? Was the rampant Mumble Chatter too mumbley? Perhaps it was the shared fear of tripping over a tree root or coming in contact with poison ivy.

Maybe it was having Disco Duck's recent copperhead snake warning ringing in our ears, trying to figure out who was going to carry Liverpool out of the woods if he gets bit again or was Grease Monkey's silent protesting slowly spreading through the PAX.

Whatever it was, it wasn't what I had on my neatly-typed and laminated Weinke.

**Warm UP  
**Mosey down to the big open field for some Good Mornings, Windmill, Cotton Pickers, SSH, Imperial Walkers

**The Thang  
**Run 2 miles around the lake stopping every tenth of a mile to perform the following exercises increasing the number of reps each time we stop from 1 to 10. Then after the first mile decrease the number of reps by 1down from 10 to 1.

Exercises: Squat, L/R Lunge, Star Jump, CDD, Merkin, L/R Mnt. Climber, Plank Jack, LBC, Box Cutter, V-Up

See! Simple right? Until we stopped at mile 1.3 and someone noticed we only had a few minutes to get back to the flag. So we stopped doing the exercises and just ran, arriving at exactly 6:30 (ish.)

Didn't even have time for 100s :-(
