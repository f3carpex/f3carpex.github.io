PAX: Big Red, Blistex (visiting from F3 Kansas City), Deuce, Imp, Rooney, Smokey, WWW

It was a glorious morning: 36 degrees, minimal wind, excellent AO, the gate to the big field was open, and HIMs ready to get their workout on after enjoying their Christmas festivities the day prior.

No FNGs but we did have an out of town visitor, Kansas City (F3 Blistex). Welcome Brother!

F3ministravia done. We Pledged Our Allegiance to Old Glory and off we go. We took advantage of the gate to the big field being opened so we moseyed around the field (that’s a big field). We paused at the lighted corner to circle-up and stretch the muscles out.

Warm-up: GM, Sir Fazio, air presses, Eskimo Merkins.

Mosey to the entry gate to get our thang on.

Thang 1:

Burpee x10 QIC down. Mosey to next stop for Low slow flutter x25 IC. Mosey to next stop for Imperial Walkers x25 IC. Mosey to next stop for Merkins x25 QIC down. Mosey again and do Plank Destroyer x5 IC and Squat ankle touches x25 QIC down.

Slow mosey to QIC truck to pick up our coupons. Partner up and PAX choice: cinderblock or ruck sand bag. Meander over to the skate park for thang 2.

Thang 2: Flora (Dora’s angry sister who loves coupon work). P1 does the below exercises and P2 mosey around designated pickle, flapjack until Flora was well taken cared of.

The challenge is to get everything done in 30 mins, so the rest you can get is when you mosey.

100 Burpee rock your body

200 Curls

200 Giant American Hammers

Circle up for Mary: 150 and LBC x25 IC.

COR: 7

NOR: HIMs

Announcements: New Year's Convergence at SNS.

NMS:

Q 61 of 52 Q challenge

It is always an honor to get out in the gloom with some crazy Brothers who just want to workout and fellowship so they can accelerate in life.
