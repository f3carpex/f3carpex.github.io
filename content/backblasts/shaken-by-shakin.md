**AO:** Shaken Not Stirred  
**Workout Date:** 07/07/21  
I've always been confused by the spelling of Shakin Not Stirred on the f3carpex.com schedule. Obviously some type of 007 reference for the (James) Bond Park AO. As I tweeted out the night before, I could only think Shakin was an obscure reference to the classic Eddie Money song. You are correct, that does not make sense.  
  
I've posted Bond Park workouts a few times, but never at the anchor boot camp of Carpex's former weekly convergence. It's still a convergence, as I would find out as I tried to get a head count at the beginning and end of the workout. It's just a smaller scale than the days of yore. I'm sharing this more for our Raleigh brothers as I'm sure I'm very late to the party on most of this myself.

**Warm Up:**  
State the mission, check for FNGs (0), and give the disclaimer  
Pledge of Allegiance  
Side Straddle Hop x20 In Cadence (IC)  
Good Morning x5 IC  
Imperial Walker x20 IC  
Sir Fazio Arm Circles forward x10 IC, reverse x10 IC  
Callahan is present and talking up my warm ups, so I make sure to not skip downward dog and world's greatest stretch  
Downward Dog and isolated calf stretches  
World’s Greatest Stretch

**Main Event**  
**1)** Mosey to the field for **Jacob's Ladder** (burpees) back up the hill  
**2)** Mosey to the back parking lot and partner up for **Dora 1-2-3**. I can't remember if it was merkins/LBCs/Squats or plank jacks/American Hammers/squats.  
**3)** Mosey to picnic shelter. Not enough time for a 10-15-10 pyramid, so switch to **10-20 (non) pyramid**. LRSUs, Irkins, Dips, Little Gyno Crunches, Derkins.

**Mary:**  
Some combination of Dolly, Homer to Marge, Freddy Mercurys, maybe some others. All x10 IC.

**COT:**  
18 PAX (10 SNS, 3 Vesper, 5 Maynard)  
  
Prayers spoken and unspoken.  
  
I don’t remember who took us out.

**Naked Moleskin:**  
After going back and forth between the website and Slack (and also finding a Carpex Shaken Not Stirred shirt listed on Mudgear), I have determined Shakin is a misspelling. I'm sure I'll hear the correct answer on Slack once I share this Backblast.  
Counting off with Flacco and Sabre moving through the circle, trying to Irish Goodbye their way out to Vesper, was... entertaining.  
T-claps to everyone for (unknowingly) pushing me to get the full 20 derkins. I would not have done that if I were alone.  
Cobains to Shut-In; I believe I mistakenly gave credit for Carpex's early return to BOM to Hi-Liter. Shut-In called it long before those lollygaggers at F3 Corporate got on board.  
This was my seventy-third #F3Q21 #2021Challenge Q (seventy-fifth overall). Next Q is Friday at Sheepdog in South Wake.
