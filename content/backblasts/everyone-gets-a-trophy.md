There was some extra incentive for outstanding performances at Rush Hour. Since YHC was left out of the awards in the Hill Climb Mafia (I still can't believe I didn't get a sticker or anything), I thought the Rush Hour PAX could use some disingenuous recognition. So trophies were presented. Everyone went home feeling good, whether they deserved it or not. There was no pizza party or orange slices after, but 2 stopped at Bond Brothers for a reward.

    NMS: I want to thank Flenderson for all the work he put into the Hill Climb Challenge. It was a nice distraction from being inside and incentive to get out and do something different and challenging. Although I did not do many hills, the ones I did were enough. TYFYL.
