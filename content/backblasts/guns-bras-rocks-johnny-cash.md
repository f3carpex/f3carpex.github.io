The threat of rain didn't keep too many away today. Parking lot filled and at 5:45 sharp (or thereabouts since YHC didnt have a timepiece today) we were off towards the front entrance of the park. Tight pax running 2x2 on the sidewalk headed up the High House hill to the 2nd entrance where we circled up for warm up.

GM x20, IW x20, SSH x20, Sir Fazio - 10 each way

Partner up and remember your partner for the rest of the day.

P1 - 10 merkins, P2 - run - Catch me if you can - and flapjack with Merkins on each catch - back to community center. Continue catch me around the small race track until all Pax have arrived.

Over to the rock pile - get a rock (yes - per person, not per pair) (no answer to - whether or not we are travelling - YHC believes that Pax are on a need to know basis only)

Around to the back of the building for a set of Wonderbra x20, Colt 45s, PC Hammer x20, Rest, Rinse, Repeat - sets of 15 2nd time around.

Get your partner again for some Flora 1,2,3 - if you don't know Flora - she is one of Dora's angry cousins - all with rocks - cumulative by pair - 100 merkins, 200 LBCs, 300 squats - with rock torture for partner not exercising.

Rocks back - and around to the side of the building for a limited showing of animal kingdom

Animal Kingdom Run across parking lot, crab walk back Backwards run, backwards crab Lunge walk – bear crawl – Backwards lunge – crawl bear

Over to backside of senior center for some limited Johnny Cash - Ring of Fire. Pax in a circle - planking. Each pax do 5 WW2 1 or 2 at a time while remaining Pax alternate between regular, chilcut, R arm high, L arm high

Apparently time was up (thanks for the friendly? assitance with the time) - quick count o'rama and then back to front side of senior center to continue count with Vesper 25 - SNS, 4 Vesper
