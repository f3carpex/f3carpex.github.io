They say repetition is the key to mastery. If this is true then the HIM at Tortoises have reached the level of "Master" at receiving a full body beatdown.Â Shifu Xinkule.

Prior to the workout Disco Duck, Earhart, Freebird and YHC enjoyed a relaxing 3-mile EC. It was a nice run, however we were almost tased by a female Apex police officer for running on the road instead of the sidewalk. Earhart volunteered to be cuffed and undergo a full body search, but she wasn't having it. We were set free with a warning, which we promptly ignored soon after she drove out of sight. _(Disclaimer: parts of this story have been fabricated.)_

YHC concluded with a quote from author and speaker Kevin Skeens.

> "If you only had today, what would you do? Would you wake up and show the world who you are? Would you stand up for it? Or would you sit back and wait for it? Be something today that even yourself will look up to the next day. You get one chance in this lifetime. No day is guaranteed. Don't let things go unsaid, goals unmet and effort not given. Make every minute of everyday count."
