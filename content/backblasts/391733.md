**Pre-Blast**

- 13 lean mean running machines convened at Kryptonite for a sweatier-then-normal high tempo jaunt through the darker-every-day gloom that enveloped CarPex's exclusive AO designed to push even the most elite athletes to grow stronger by challenging themselves and one another to go further and faster than they ever have or thought they could because they had inadvertently placed self-imposed limits that God wants for them to break.

**The Warmup**

- Pledge of Allegiance at the flag
- Run up the parking lot, around the end island, backwards run and then regular run by the lake to the side of Kokabooth for warmups
