POGL maybe, but they really should sweep the parking lots occasionally. YHC thought it was just me, but the PAX complained as well. Enough bitching.

## Warm-up

Mosey to the park, butt kickers, high knees, backwards run. At the parking lot, warm up shoulders and get the heart-rate up a little.

## Thing 1

Partner catch-me if you can. Two laps around play area with burpees (x5). Two laps around with star jumps (x10). Finally, two more laps around with jumping lunges (x10).

## Thing 2

Bear crawl 1-2-3 with partner. This is where we discovered how dirty the parking lot actually was.

Return to the flag for some mary.
