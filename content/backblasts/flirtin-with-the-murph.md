Hi-Liter asked me to step in for the FWD Q this week, I was honored! Leading up to the Q, I thought to myself, What would Hi-Liter do? I figured it had been at least 4 or 5 days since his last Murph, so it must be time for another Murph, right?! But the famous Memorial Day Murph convergence is right around the corner. Now FWD is strategically placed .5 miles from Cary's flagship pedestrian bridge, which is irresistible to YHC with the Q. So in an effort to combine many great things YHC lead the PAX through a modified half Murph to tease them with the good the things to come on Memorial Day.

**Warm-Up**  
\-Mosey a little  
\-Stretch a little

**The Thang**  
Grab yourself a Traveling rock and follow me to the ped. bridge and find a partner. 50 Pull-ups and 100 Merkins on the bridge between the 2 partners.  
Then a few runs up the zig zaggy hill on the far side of the bridge with curls, overhead presses and rock rows at the bottom of the hill.  
Another 50 Pull-ups and 100 Merkins between the 2 partners (audible moans were heard).  
Mosey back to the parking lot and finish up the 150 individual overhead rock squats than were being completes in quantities of 20 and 30 on the way out and back from the bridge.

In total each HIM completed 50 pull-ups, 100 merkins and 150 overhead rock squats and roughly 2 miles. Great work men!
