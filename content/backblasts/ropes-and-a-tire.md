When Wrench announced he couldn’t keep his tire at his new house and wanted to see if we could stash it somewhere, I jumped on this chance to get it. I want this tire. We made arrangements to get it to Hells Bells and with no Q on the sheet for the week, YHC threw his own name up there to get the first chance with the tire.  

So 22 HIMS showed up this morning, no fngs. Quick mosey around the lot and circle up for SSH, good mornings, runners stretch and calf stretch, and finally seal claps.  
Counted off by 3’s for the thang. Circle up for squat thrusters until the Q gets tired. Then group 1 is off for tire flips up and back down the lot, group 2 did battle ropes and medicine ball slams, and group 3 did pull-ups. Back to the circle for merkins on your bell until tired. Rotate groups. This continued in this fashion while doing lawn mowers, manmakers, high pulls, lazy boy seated presses, curls, tricep extensions, overhead lunges, pullovers to lbc’s, goblet squats, and finally rock your body. Time for Mary; hammer time and more lbc’s with your bell.  

Krispy Kreme Challenge this weekend and only Theismann and YHC among the Pax signed up.  

Lots of prayers this morning, among them Pickles MIL and Bubbas 2.0.
