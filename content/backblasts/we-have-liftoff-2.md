**NMS**

Welcome FNG Soyuz, EH’ed by Rock Lobster. He probably hoped for an Army related name, but the rocket dictated something space oriented. Thanks Build a Bear for pulling the name of the early Soviet spacecraft program out of his arse as well as having a camera to take that perfect photo.

Props to Captain Jack for suggesting we should look for the rocket this morning. It sounds like some other AOs were able to see it, but for SWW, we needed to be out of the park to catch a glimpse.

Suck Up continued to live up to his name. Love that guy!

Coffee game was strong (literally) with Bluewater in charge.

Francois was supposedly cooking a brisket, but word is that he is too soft to post in the cold

Fluoride was his typical 30 seconds late, but I didn’t realize it in time to dole out penalty burpees

Always and honor to lead!
