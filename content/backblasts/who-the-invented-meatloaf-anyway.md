If you wake up at 04:50, hear the rain hitting the side of the house, and don't think about fart-sacking, we can't be friends. But one way to resist the urge is to be signed up to Q. Out of bed and head over to A-Team to get in a quick 2 mile EC run before the Main Event. Eleven other marginally disturbed HIMs are there with YHC for what they will later learn is a mini-Meatloaf's Massacre, otherwise known as the 2019 week 2 IronPax workout.

## Warm Up

Pledge of Allegiance, F3 Mission recited, no FNGs so we do the disclaimer silently.

Mosey to the first parking lot and circle up for: SSHs, Sir Fazio forward and back, Seal Claps, Steve Earles, Plank Jacks, and CF Merkins

## The Thang

Wade into the mud to find a non-traveling rock. Use said rock to complete:

- 10 Manmakers
- 20 Overhead presses
- 30 Rock Squats
- Run 5 laps around the pickle. Then complete same exercise, run 4 laps. Complete down to 1 lap.
- Once done, we do Curls X 30 and Tricep extensions X 30

## Mary

American Hammers

## COT

12 wet HIMs, 3 Respects by my count and the rest Mehs. Prayers lifted for How How's family, as well as Chicken Little's FIL. YHC took us out.

## NMS

- Saban left in a hurry
- The rocks were a little dirty
- I've not been shy about saying this workout owned me during IPX 2019. We did drop a couple exercises to make it more manageable during a standard 45 minute workout
- We did introduce the white elephant rock exchange between rounds - it was popular
- MIAGD - and keep improving
