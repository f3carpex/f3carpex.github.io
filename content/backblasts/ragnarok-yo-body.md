Four pax and one dog showed up at Ragnarok for a holy cow what time is it? 8 PM? Seriously? OK, here we go.

**Warm-Up** Mosey over to the little basketball court and diamond up for failed hillbillies, penalty burpees, seal claps, cherry pickers, copperhead merkins and copperhead squats.

**The Thang** Grab an ego rock at the rock pile and line up on the big basketball court. Three rounds of 10 rock squats, 10 overhead presses, run to the other end, 10 monkey humpers, 10 dry docks, run back. Repeato with curls, tricep extensions, Supermans and LBCs. Repeato with RAGNAROK-yo-body and burpees.

Mosey back to the shelters for 7s, alternating left-right step-ups in the big shelter, mosey down to the small shelter for dips, bear crawl back.

**Mary** Grab a table top in the big shelter with all pax calling Mary exercises.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  4 **Name-a-rama**:  0 RESPECT, 4 meh, 0 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for Crimson and his family, prayers for Chewie's upcoming deadline at work. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**  It was great to see Katniss in the gloom again! Tang brought is dog Bosco, and he was a good boy! Tang got Bosco at the shelter a few years ago where they had named him Martin. Not Marty. Martin. What kind of maniac names a dog Martin? We didn't give Bosco an F3 name yet, but we're leaning towards Martin. Love you guys!
