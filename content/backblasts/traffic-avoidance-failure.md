Excited that DD put out a feeler for a replacement Q and YHC was available. Mildly concerned that we wouldn’t have anyone show up, but Ollie announced that he would be there, so I knew we would have a workout. It was awesome to have 8 show up.

Mojo has some wheels!

Rush Hour lived up to its name as there was tons of traffic. I need to plan a route that doesn’t involve crossing the street so often next time I Q here.

Called on all of the newer guys to lead various sets of exercises and they all nailed it. Captain Kirk likes to call merkins slowly.

35 Starfish Crunches was ambitious. Called a break at 19 to let the pax (and Q) regain form. We did finish them up.

Solid 2nd F followed at Bond Brothers. Kermit was planning for his VQ at Phoenix and we were not shy about giving him pointers.

Theismann toying with the idea of a pub crawl workout for Rush Hour. I think I like it
