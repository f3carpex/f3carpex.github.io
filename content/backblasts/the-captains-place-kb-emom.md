**Interlude** – Mosey to field where someone had left the tractor tire. Plan was to take turns flipping it back to where it needed to be stored. If you weren’t flipping, you were doing pull-ups or burpees while you waited your turn. Once everyone had a go with the tire and it was stored away we moved back over toward the curb near the church to resume the EMOM

A few weeks ago I didn’t know this AO existed. One of your AO Qs (Wahoo) happened to be at Raleigh’s Green Flash AO one morning and we had a chance to talk at Coffeeteria. One of the things I remember him saying is that it seems like the same guys step up to Q all the time. As a fellow site Q (Saturday’s Catalyst in Raleigh) I know the feeling. So thought that it would be a good idea to take one of the upcoming Q slots here to give the Carpex region a little variety. On Sunday night when I was setting my alarm for 4am (to allow for coffee, morning lollygagging, travel, pre-scouting, etc) it seemed less of a good idea that it had a few weeks prior.  
  
I showed up before 5 thinking I’d have some quiet time to look around and put things together. There were already afew folks on the pull-up bars. And it seems like it grew by two or three pax every five minutes. Strong pre-work!  
  
I’m a big fan of the kettlebell and often Q the one in Raleigh (Wednesday’s ‘The Blitz’). As I did Monday morning, I will always use a timer of some sort…EMOM or Tabata. I think it’s a great wat to keep the heartrate up while also getting the bell work in. It’s also a nice way to self-Q in your garage or traveling (if you travel with a kettlebell like I do ;-) I’ll be back to Hell’s Bells soon!  
  
**PSA**: if you are in the market for a new kettlebell to bring to this workout or keep in the garage, Walmart online (has to be online, not at store) usually has some inexpensive options. Search for CAP kettlebell and have it shipped to nearby store free (or if over $35 to your home and watch the delivery guy struggle with it to bring it up to your doorstep). Example a 30 lb is 29.99, 40 lb is 34.99, etc. a dollar per pound is pretty cheap and these are less than that.
