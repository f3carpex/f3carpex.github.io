## 5-Week Study: 10 Ways to be an Exceptional Parent in a "Quick Fix" World.

I feel like time is running out and I'm not parenting with the urgency I should have. I don't want to get my kids off to college and then look back and think my intentions were good but my effort was lackluster.

**So I need a spark** and I found this guide through church and I need some accountability and guys to go all in with me so we can encourage and support one another.

_Disclaimer: This book talks about Jesus and uses Bible verses as a foundation but I don't think it necessarily means you have to hold Christian beliefs to think this is applicable to us as parents in general. This should be open to all Dads from what I can tell!_

### **Proposed Agenda**

This is a 5 Week Study starting the first week of November.

- **HOW TO START**
    - Each man HCs by buying the book: [**Amazon Link**](https://www.amazon.com/Intentional-Parenting-Exceptional-Parent-Quick-Fix/dp/1635700868/)
    - Join the #parenting channel on Slack
    - Each week you complete 2 chapters OYO
- **WHEN / WHERE**
    
    - One day a week from sometime between 0530 and 0700 - time depending on participates
    
    - We meet at a park under a shelter that has light - I'm thinking Bond Park or SWW
    - EC pre run option
- **MEETING**
    
    - Start with the week prior's **Take Action** - what did you do, how did you take action?
    
    - We watch this week's video (7-8mins)
    - What stood out in these 2 chapters?
    - Discuss the **Activity** questions in the workbook
    - End in COT style prayer/praises

**I want guys who are ALL IN.** Reading and study are completed upon arrival and perfect attendance. Once we form the group we can get schedules and times and locations aligned but I want to make sure you know when you sign up **YOU ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR COMPLETING THIS.**
