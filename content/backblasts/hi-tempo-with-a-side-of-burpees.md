It wasn't too hot, but it was about 1000% humidity as 14 HIMs braved the Booth to get Monday started the right way.

**Warm up**

Pledge allegiance, then mosey over to the Booth parking lot for SSHs, Cotton Pickers, Sir Fazio forward and back, overhead claps, and imperial walkers.

**The Thang**

Four Corners/The Cooper Hybrid

At each corner of the lot, we will complete 10 burpees/10 prisoner squats/10 CDDs/10 Peter Parkers.  De-escalate by 1 rep each lap until complete with a final lap of 1 rep each.  We make it just in time for Burpee & Prisoner squat remedial training, 10 each OYO.  Like a good ice cream sundae, the cherry on top is a Billy Bear Crawl, then mosey back to the flag.

Have a Nice Day

13 Mehs, 1 Respect

Announcements: The Maynard, see Hermes for details

Prayers/Praises: McCants for recovery, Yoga Mat continuing to recover, WaterWings' family.  Robbie Helbert's recovery from double lung transplant last week.

YHC took us out.

**NMS**

- This workout was a hybrid combination of Four Corners & The Cooper.  It totally sucked and so we'll probably do it again sometime.
- Most PAX do a proper burpee.  However, there were some "liberties" taken with both burpee and prisoner squat form, so we had a quick class on each at the end.
- Since Blue Water came in hot at 5:31, those 10 extra burpees (65 total) were gonna happen anyway.
- The Billy Bear Crawl was not planned, but it just felt right.
- The Kryptonite regulars are beasts.  YHC was just trying to NOT get lapped.
- YHC mentioned Gwenyth Paltrow arms in the warm up.  If your M does FIA, ask her to show you that one.  Kicks Sir Fazio's lazy ass.
- Probably a bad idea to post/Q at Kryptonite after a week of drinking beer at the beach.  But then again, why not?
- T-claps for McCants.  This guy has the sense of humor to post a pic of himself, busted up in the hospital, and ASKED for memes.
- Thanks for the opportunity to lead this group. Be a little bit better today than you were yesterday.
