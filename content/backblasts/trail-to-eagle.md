YHC wanted to exemplify the Scout Motto and arrived a full 15 minutes early for Phoenix. Sadly, that's about where "Being Prepared" ended for this end-of-the-Scout-week Q. Nevertheless, after a full week away from home, I was excited to share some of Scoutings, and in particular, the Eagle Ranks, more important numerical milestones.

### NMS

Thanks Sooey for organizing Scout Week for us. Great idea and awesome to see so many HIMs step up and lead. The Scouts helped form me and my love for the outdoors and I am grateful for the perseverance my parents showed in getting my younger self to stick with it.
