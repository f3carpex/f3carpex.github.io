**Pre-BB**

Quick explanation on the theme of today's work-out at Wolverine…I was reminded on Sunday at church how easy it is, one week after a school shooting and one day after Veterans Day, to simply slip back into my routine and go on with life. There are many “Monday mornings” when people in painful places go back to their challenges and the rest of us go on with life. Thus, "The Murph" as a reminder that many still face their painful circumstances when the rest of us have returned to our routines.

And why the PRE-Blast @Banjo asks? Because people who wake up on Mondays facing their challenges don't have the luxury of deciding whether or not they'll face those challenges. There's no "Q-Shopping" in life. I thank the Lord Jesus that He promised in Matthew 18:20, "...surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age." To the end of our lives...to the end of life's most difficult seasons - God will never leave of forsake us. Let's allow every season of our souls teach us to trust in Him all the more.
