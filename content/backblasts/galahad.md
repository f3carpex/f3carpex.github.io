Beautiful evening in downtown Cary, not too hot, not too humid, let's get after it. YHC has the Q, but Crimson is ready to jump in and co-Q with me.

**Warm-Up**

Mosey around to the parking lot next to the train tracks and circle up for imperial walkers, cotton pickers and standard merkins (on my down AND my up).

**The Thang**

Mosey around to the bottom level of the parking deck. Run up the stairs one level, five carolina dry docks, run back down, five LBCs. Run up two levels, ten dry docks, run back down, ten LBCs. Run up three levels, fifteen dry docks, run back down, fifteen LBCs. Run up two levels, twenty dry docks, run back down, twenty LBCs. Run up one level, twenty-five dry docks, run back down, twenty-five LBCs.

Mosey down to the wall at the bottom entrance, partner up. Partners flapjack between BTTW and twenty squats, BTTW and twenty squats, and BTTW and ten squats for a total of one hundred squats.

Mosey over to the courtyard with the big fountain for dips, bear crawls, irkins, crab walks, box jumps, crawl bears and derkins, followed by a lap around the courtyard.

Mosey up to the rails near the flags for descending irkins and Australian pull-ups, from ten down to one. Just for fun twenty derkins.

Mosey over to the pocket park for dips, irkins, step-ups and derkins.

**Mary**

Circle up for dying cock-a-roaches, American hammers, box cutters, one hundreds, burpees and Have A Nice Day.

**COT**

**Count-a-rama**:  2 **Name-a-rama**:  1 RESPECTs, 1 meh **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for multiple PAX and their family members **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**

Only two PAX but we pushed each other hard and had a great time doing it.

Only two PAX but COT took almost as long as the workout. Crimson and YHC like to talk.

COT took place with feet in the fountain.

Both PAX appreciate the benefits of F3 and the encouragement and inspiration we get from our brothers.
