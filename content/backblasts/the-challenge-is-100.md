Thank goodness that I'm the co-Site Q for A Team (one of the original 5 Carpex AOs) and we have a reminder for who is Q'ing this week and next week. I had a great weekend trip with the M that I almost forgot that I signed up to Q today. Since it is my goal to Q at least once a week, I always have a workout in my back pocket.

It's great to get out in the gloom and watch the Brothers trickle in for a planned beatdown. As always, I want the routine to be tough but achievable.  This one was tough.  We got through the F3 admin stuff.  No FNGs.  PoA to Old Glory done.  Off we went to QIC/YHC truck for you guessed it, coupons for everyone.

As everyone sized up their coupon, which they all were the same, we took quicktimed (speed walk) to the big parking lot to circle up for warm up.  Warm-up: GM with coupon, hamstring stretch with coupon, Abe Vigoda without coupon, calf stretch (l/c/r), Eskimo Merkins (this has become one of my favorites).

Now for the Thang.  100 challenge. Partner up so you have an accountable partner to help you or you help HIM to complete the challenge.

6 exercises (with coupons):  Burpees, WWIIs, merkins, mountain climbers (4 count), squats, curls.  Between the partners, they will decide on how to meet the challenge.  If they wanted a break, they would both run / walk around the pickle.

I think there were only 2 pairs that finished the challenge.  What's awesome is our very own Nan'tan Emeritus, Ma Bell, completed the challenge. I meant to ask the group who finished the challenge for some bragging rights but for the sake of time, it did not happen.  For those that finished, GREAT WORK!!!  For those that pushed themselves and pushed your Brother, GREAT WORK!!!  Roaster and I got 7 sets completed.

Total count:

10 sets completed:  600 reps + the pickles they completed; 9 sets - 540 reps; 8 sets - 480 reps, 7 reps - 420 reps, etc.

Due to time, QIC called it at 5 mins til to close out the workout.  QIC took the remaining minutes to have a drop in Rubberman Man stretching routine.  Have a nice day!
