It's A Team and this is my backblast.

Pledge of Allegiance then...

## Warm Up

Mosey to the parking lot by the tennis courts. Circle up for Sir Fazio arm circles, Overhead claps, Steve Earles, and some runners/calf/hamstring/hip stretching.

## All the Thangs

- First, go to the traffic circle by the picnic area. Partner up. Partner 1 does El Capitan around the circle. Partner 2 runs around the opposite direction. Each time you meet, 10 merkins and then switch. Each partner runs 5 times.
- Mosey to the little rock pile by the basketball court.
- Don't get rocks yet, but do have Kwik Stop give a 10 count. Set of 7s, on this hill do 1 LBC, on the opposite hill at the speed hump do 6 burpees. Oh, and run all uphills backwards
- Get to about 3/4 and realize you're running out of time. Meet back at the rock pile for 3 sets of rock curls, overhead presses, and squats
- Mosey back to the front parking lot

## Mary

American Hammers, Supermans, Calf and hamstring stretches. Have a Nice Day

## COT

An even dozen PAX, and average age was up there.

Your October is booked.

We took prayers and praises, and YHC took us out.

## NMS

- Wawa taught my kids in Sunday School. No wonder they're so...nevermind
- I mean, we had 2 Honors in the group this morning.
- Great to see Freebird out there this morning.
- BRR training doesn't always have to be mileage. Just most of the time.

MIAGD!!!
