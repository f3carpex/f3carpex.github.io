The Sharknado.  It has been a tradition for 2+ years at Bounty Hunters, the finest downtown Apex AO on Thursday mornings.  This quarterly fitness test allows each PAX to test themselves with a variety of exercises and lap-running. 15 PAX showed up to withstand the Sharknado.  With Rooney on the IR with a foot injury, he took all Sharknado materials to the community center and Imp ran point for the morning.  2 ran the POGL Dinosaur, 13 pledged their allegiance, and off we go…
