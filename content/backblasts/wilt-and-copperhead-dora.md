YHC had a great beatdown planned for Back in Black this week. Unfortunately my good buddy Yoga Mat did most of it during his Respect Week Q last week. Went back to the drawing board and came up with this.

**Warm-Up** Disclaimer and Pledge, then mosey over to the Koka Booth entrance for three rounds of quick feet and irkens, then to the bottom of the hill and circle up for cherry pickers, Steve Earles, arm twirlies, seal claps and copperhead merkins.

**The Thang** Honoring the most points scored in an NBA game, and copying F3JoCo Legend Stretch, we do a variation of the Wilt. 25 carolina dry docks at the bottom of the hill, 25 monkey humpers at the top of the hill, 25 LBCs at the bottom, for four rounds.

Mosey back to the top of the hill for a Roman ten count from Hermes, then partner up for Copperhead Dora, 100 copperhead Supermans, 200 copperhead merkins, 300 copperhead squats.

**Mary** Mosey back to the flag for Freddie Mercury, dying cock-a-roaches, a couple of all you gots across the lot, and Have A Nice Day.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  10 **Name-a-rama**:  0 RESPECT, 9 meh, 1 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for Quiver and his family, prayers for all Carpex husbands and our marriages. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS** Thanks to Stretch for being the only "Raleigh" guy to post backblasts.

YHC didn't think we'd have enough time to finish all those copperhead exercises, but the men pushed hard and go it done.

No one does a ten count better than Hermes.

I don't like saying "Hate Kermit" during COT because he's such a good dude and a High Impact Man. Then he glides by me like I'm standing still during All You Gots and I'm OK with it.

Strong work this morning gentlemen, thank you for letting me lead.
