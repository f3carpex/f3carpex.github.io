Crunch Time, Boo Yah

February 6, 2018

AO: Rush Hour

Q: Banjo

Pax:  Aristocrat, Disco Duck, Mojo, Ollie, YHC Banjo

During morning mosey to school with youngest 2.0, I was reminded that M will be picking up 2.0 from school. With some new found free time, my cooking dinner responsibilities were last night, YHC pondered ever so briefly on the prospects: post at Rush Hour or Q Rush Hour. Perfect. YHC had a planned scheduled stop at Peak Olive Oil

[https://peakoliveoil.com/](https://peakoliveoil.com/) in DTC anyway to drop off checks for my 2.1s mission trip to Bosnia.

 

With the recent passing of the Eastern #octothreataclipse, [https://f3louisville.com/2018/02/07/2-7-blender-backblast-thankfully-the-internet-still-works-on-the-east-coast-after-two-octothreats-in-two-days-getbetter/amp/?\_\_twitter\_impression=true](https://f3louisville.com/2018/02/07/2-7-blender-backblast-thankfully-the-internet-still-works-on-the-east-coast-after-two-octothreats-in-two-days-getbetter/amp/?__twitter_impression=true)

YHC was thinking of the recovery efforts and all the hard work that will go into preparing these men for the next #octothreat. Survival, a preparedness for the mind body and spirit. Following a YOGI primer, “slow and controlled with purpose" we prepared.
