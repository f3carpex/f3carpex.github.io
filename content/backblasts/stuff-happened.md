It's Revolution time in CARPEx and about 30 dudes were running the Maynard. YHC came out for Insomnia and ... ran it solo despite the parking lot being full of cars. Plus it was really cold. So I didn't expect many guys to show up.

But show up they did. In droves. All within 30 seconds of go time.

30 seconds later we were off. Only one goal today: keep everyone warm.

**Warm-up:**

Mosey the long way around to the parking lot by the activity center. Lots of different things alternating between up-right (SSH, IW, King Tuts, etc) and plank (merkins, MC, PJs, etc). Pretty much everything expect for GMs. As Franklin reminded me. Several times.

**Thang:**

Mosey to somewhere in the park.

Do some stuff in that area of park.

Rinse & repeat.

Back to the parking lot.

**Mary:**

No time. All done.

**COT:**

- 18 for the SNS; another 24 or so for some version of the Maynard
- Prayers for Hotspot; Higgins; Honeycomb
- Announcements: sign up for the CARPEx Challenge

**NMS:**

Kwikstop and his shirtless Maynard & sleeveless January is ... looney tunes.
