Another great Monday morning to start at the best AO in Apex (I'm biased of course). Nine (9) fellow animals were out this morning getting their workout with the assistance of some 25lb to 45lb friends. It's a great way to start your week and have I said how good the group is?

PAX: Earhart, Sooey, Crimson, Capone, Beaker, WWW, Red Ryder, Wilbur and Monkey Nut

We all roll in about the same time, at said time we start grunting like Crimson. We admire the newly completed flag, decorated by Earhart. It's a solid flag, come out just to see that if you haven't been to one.

We started the warmup at the end of the parking lot. Some SSH, Imperial Storm walkers, windmills, and it's go time.

The workout:

Mosey back to the tables and start with squats, curls and triceps extensions going around the tables using a different kettlebell each time. Total of 10 IC for each exercise. When everyone made the round (including one station of farmers carry with the 45lbs kettlebells), run a lab around the tennis courts. Come back and do kettlebell swings, squat presses and halos'. Add some lawn mowers in on this round. Complete the circuit and run a lab. Come back again and hit some additional exercises, figure 8's, curls, squats, farmer carry and run a lap. Set of dirkins (10x) and it's Mary time. LBC's with chest press, Freddy Mercury, all fun stuff.

Observations: The 45 minutes fly by when this group is around. First, just getting to hear Crimson grown, grunt and make noises are priceless. He is a good sport and we get to harass everyone there.

Finished off with some announcements. Signup for event's are coming, Bear, Mule, etc. Prayers for Kelly (Disco's M) and Monkey Nut's Dad (had a quick hospital trip this weekend, but seems to be on the mend).

By leading this morning, it was a great start to the week. I'm always sore from the Monday morning kettlebell work. It has a little of everything, weights, running and Crimson. Thanks for letting me come out and Q this morning.
