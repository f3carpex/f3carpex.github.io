Another beautiful evening in downtown Cary. YHC is here, Speed Racer is here, Traffic Cone is here...wait, who's that? Is it? Can it be? It's Napster, our brother from F3Denver coming home for a visit.

**Warm-Up**

Mosey around to the parking lot next to Page Walker and circle up for hillbillies, Sir Fazios, mountain climbers and imperial walkers.

**The Thang**

Mosey over to the bank and grab some bench for irkins, dips, derkins and ALRSUs.

Count off in 1's and 2's. 1's BTTW while 2's knock out 20 squats, flap jack. Repeato with people's chair and merkins.

1's run around the bank while 2's AMRAP merkins, flap jack. Repeato with squats, repeato with LBCs.

Mosey over to the parking lot behind the Chamber of Commerce. Run to the bottom of the lot, plank it out for the six, merkins as a group, Mary exercise as a group. Run to the top of the lot, squat it out for the six, squats as a group, Mary exercise as a group. Repeato a few times with various Mary exercises.

Mosey over to the pocket park and grab some wall for irkins, dips, derkins and ALRSUs.

**Mary**

Circle up in the grass and go around the circle a couple of times for PAX led Mary exercises.

**COT**

**NMS**

So great to have Napster in town for a visit. We miss having him here, but he's in Denver, leading the F3 expansion there. A lot of sad clowns will become HIM thanks to his efforts. Please support him any way you can.

Did you notice the mountain climbers during warm-up? Those were for Napster.

Speed Racer is just about ready to lead a work out, but he is definitely ready to lead the mumble chatter. He criticized my rhythm during Sir Fazios, criticized my form during plank holds, I think at some point he said something about my mother. Keep an eye on this guy.
