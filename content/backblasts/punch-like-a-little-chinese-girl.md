**AO: Flirtin with Disaster**

Was an honor to lead 19 Pax for a little q-swap Frozen Ring of Fire. No FNGs, one visitor from Edenton NC. And Chipper, Yoga Mat, Lite Brite, Bonham, and Banjo for a little EC run.

Warm-up: light jog, Side Straddle Hop, stretch neck front to back & side to side, Sir Fazio Arm Circles front & back, Chinooks, Moroccans Night Clubs (w/ squat hold), Sumo Squats, Imperial Walkers, Hillbillies, Standard Merkins (slow count), and Capoeira Push-ups. 

Workout: Quick instruction on Rooting, Striking, and Wedging. 

Then, Wing Chun Ring of Fire. 

4 Pax in a clock (12-3-6-9) led the pace by knocking out 10 reps of rotating exercises (standard Merkins, Diamond Merkins, Wide Grip Merkins, Squats, & Squat Kicks).  

After first 4 Pax finished 10 reps next 4 would go, rotating clockwise each time. 

All other Pax rotated through Wing Chun Striking and Wedging. Then, 3-set combinations in cadence. Finished with a little more technical compliance technique. 

Mary: LBCs, Crab Cakes, & Breakdancers. 

COT: Name-o-Rama, announcement, and Prayer requests. 

Prayed us out. 

Blessed to be apart. 2nd F followed at NY Bagel & Deli.
