19 HIM gathered at ao-wolverine for a great start to the week with some hill repeats not-so-cleverly disguised as sevens.

Mosey to the Park Village Pool lot for Warm-up:  
\- Side-straddle-hop, Calf-stretch, Calf-stretch 'merkin, Hill Billy, Sir Fazio forward and reverse

The Big Thang:

Sevens on the full half-mile hill; burpees at the bottom and squats at the top. Grumbling slowed down as everyone realized just how much fun it is to start their week off right.

The Little Thang:

Mosey back to the Paviliion for some upper body work featuring Dips and Urkins.

Mary:

Circle up on the Basketball court for LBC, Dying Cockroach, LSF, Box Cutter, 'Merkin, and finish off with a round of Good Morning.

In COT we prayed for Angry Elf in his soon-to-be departure and Theismann with the loss of his Mother, especially following the recent loss of MIL. Praises for a thriving 2.0 from YHC on a great summer break.

Strong showing for 2ndF at Crema.
