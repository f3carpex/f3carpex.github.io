14 pax gathered at the den of the lion with no FNGs and we are off (2 runners joined us for COT)

Brief mosey followed by basic warm up of SSH, Hillbillies and Sir Fazios (to get shoulders loosened up for merkins). 1, no make it 3 penalty burpees for the late arrival of Tramp Stamp.

1-18 David Goggins style merkins meandering through the myriad of parking areas ending up on Town Side Drive.

Mosey to the park for 4 corners, consisting of 5 Diamond Merkins, 10 Jump Squats, 15 HRM and 20 Squats

Time for some Carpex Hill Challenge Mafia work. Knock out Town Side Climb and Magnolia Climb in 4 or 5-man Indigenous People groups ending up back at the shovel flag.

The name of the workout was co-inspired from this David Goggins quote “Do something that sucks every single day of your life, that is how you grow” and Snooki’s pre-blast

1-18 merkins = 171

Apologies for the extra time to get all of the PAX home

You are welcome for knocking out 2 hills in the challenge

Town Side Climb is no joke

Great to see some new/less familiar faces this morn
