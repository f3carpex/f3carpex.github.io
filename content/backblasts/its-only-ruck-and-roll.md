**AO:** Rolling Stone  
**Workout Date:** 05/28/21  
After Qing Quickhatch, YHC wondered how much PT was expected at a Ruck workout. The Quickatch guys were happy to just ruck a couple of miles and my called exercises seemed like an awkward novelty. I reached out to site Q Bartman to get an idea for Rolling Stone and found PT would be preferred.  
  
With a big demand for PT, I opted for the weinke and did some internet searches for good ruck exercises. I actually found a Ruck workout generator and plugged in our workout specifics. I moved some things around and swapped out some exercises that I didn't know or didn't want to bother with.

**Warm Up:**  
YHC quickly learned Rolling Stone and high tempo Gran Torino start and stop at the same time. Red Ryder was Qing Gran Torino and started us off with the mission, disclaimer (no FNGs), and pledge. Once GT took off, we decided to hang in the lot for any stragglers, so I started my Weinke with Merkins x10. Once we finished I decided to do my normal warmup instead:  
  
Side Straddle Hop x20 In Cadence (IC)  
Good Morning x10 IC  
Imperial Walker x20 IC  
Sir Fazio Arm Circles forward x10 IC, reverse x10 IC  
(Skip the Standard Merkins x10 On My Down (OMD) since we already did them)  
Mountain Climbers x10 IC  
Downward Dog with calf isolation stretches  
World’s Greatest Stretch
