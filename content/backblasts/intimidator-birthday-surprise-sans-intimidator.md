I found out the week earlier that Intimidator had just turned 59, but hadn't told anyone. Never one to let a birthday go uncelebrated I planned a great Q for intimidator, yet he didn't show. Oh well.

### Thang 1: 7's

Did 7's on the hill next to the strip mall with diamond merkins at the top and jump squats at the bottom

### Thang 2: Intimidator Man-Makers

Since we all want to be like intimidator when we hit 59 we did catch me if you can with man makers. One partner had the cinder block and did five man makers then ran/walked to catch up with the other partner doing lunges. 59 total man makers were done by everyone.
