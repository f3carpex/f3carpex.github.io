NMS: Guess what? Callahan was late.

Oofta on time and biked in. Stud

YHC QIC FAIL. No count off or name-a-rama. Suggested 12 burpee penalty for each pax that did not correct the error. YHC will complete 24. Thanks Shutty for the catch as you were driving away.

Lots of mumble chatter, mostly from Hermès and his introduction to the Eunichs. Great to see Aspartame back in the gloom. Dying cockroaches ar not WWII. Shawn de Clare crushed it this am. Lots of head drops on the call for pyramid #2. Nice grade. Tclaps for picking up the 6. Good to be back at FWD. Excellent AO with so much to offer.
