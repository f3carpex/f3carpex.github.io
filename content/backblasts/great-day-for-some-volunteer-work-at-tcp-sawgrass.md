YHC was a little worried about Sunday's community event because the sky was falling all day Saturday. This guy does not do yard work in the rain. However, Our good Lord shines down and the rain broke. The Weather Channel forecasted 0% chance of rain with partly sunny forecast and mild temperature. Sunday was going to be a great day for volunteers to mow some grass for The Carying Place. 5 solid HIMs made their appearance.

Pax: Crimson, Disco Duck, Frisco, The Joker, WWW

**Warm-up**

Lifting the equipment on and off the truck. Each pax took their turn.

**The Thang**

There were several game plans brewing as Crimson and YHC were discussing on the drive to the first locale. Sooey would have been proud since I was the one who picked up Crimson and his equipment.

The best play we used was "All Hands On Deck / Full-Court Press." We all worked on each property all at once. As we hit the first property, Frisco did some 25 yard sprints with his lawnmower. The other pax watched him with amazement but kept the marathon pace going knowing that we were going to hit 2 other yards. Frisco did well at property #1 but realized the marathon pace was the better pace to not merlot.

We finished the yard in 20 mins.

**Thang 2**

At property #2, same game plan. Full-court press. We finished in 20 mins again. No breaks.

**Thang 3**

The West property was slightly bigger but it did not phase the pax. 20 mins ... done. Unfortunately, Frisco got knocked the hell out by Disco (see the posted picture). Someone got blessed with some dog blessing (feces) ... darn dog poop! Note to self, check the yard for animal droppings before working on them. I had to wash the tires on the mower but all is good. If your thinking if YHC was feces blessed, it's not me.

It was such a great time to do God's work by volunteering to help others. Thank you Gents for being there for some fun in the sun! All three property completed in 1 hr.

After a good 1 hour of work, we partook in a 2F event at Bond Bros to relax and just BS. Always a blessing to be part of a great thang!
