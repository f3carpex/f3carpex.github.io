16 Rock Stars came out on a crisp Friday morning to get stronger.

**Warm-Up**

Hustle around the pickle to the basketball courts and circle up for side straddle hops, imperical walkers, Sir Fazio arm twirlies (both ways), standard merkins and plank jacks.

Hustle across the soggy soccer field to the rock pile and choose a travelling rock.  Oops, Ford dropped his rock, everybody gets 10 penalty burpees OYO.

Tricep extensions, overhead press, curls for squirrels, rock rows and rock squats x 20.

Overhead carry your rock to the far side of the field, repeat exercises x 20.

Lunge walk with your rock to the next corner, repeat exercises x 20.

Overhead carry your rock to the next corner, repeat exercises x 20.

Lunge walk with your rock to the first corner, repeat exercises x 20.

Hustle over to the basketball court and count off 1's and 2's.  1's BTTW while 2's bear crawl to half court then run to the end and back, flapjack.  Second round with people's chair, third round BTTW, last round people's chair.

Circle up where the flag is usually planted for Freddy Mercurys, American hammers, dying cock-a-roaches, pickle pounders and Have A Nice Day.

**Count-a-rama**: 16 **Name-a-rama**: 6 RESPECTS,  7 mehs, 3 HATES **Prayers / Praises**: Prayers for WKRP's M and family after losing her uncle, prayers for Goose's son who is having minor surgery today, prayers for Hi-Liter's father who has been suffering through raditaion treatment but recieves his final two treatments this weekend, prayers for Parker and his family as they care for his father with Alzheimers. **BOM**: YHC took us out

**NMS**

We had a lively crowd this morning.  This work out kept us together in a circle for most of the morning.  Lots of mumble chatter.  Pickles and Flip Flop were both kind enough to help me out by calling some of the rock exercises.  YHC can only yell "UP" and "DOWN" so many times in one day.

Big congratulations to Pickles on earning his Six Pack.
