31 posted at Apex Nature Park this morning. 16 heard YHC had the queue and chickened out of Dante's Peak and did some sort of Soft Pax challenge or some alternate interval pull up stuff, I wasn't entirely sure what was going on but I knew we couldn't do a Murph with Theismann commandeering the pull up bars.
