Google it, if you have to. I did. Hint: it has nothing to do with Oklahoma.

19 PAX + 1 for EC only showed up at a damp and gloomy FMJ as Carpex Respect Week rolls on. Seems like an appropriate week for one of our Respects to ask, "Hey! Can you just tell me what 'OK Boomer' means so I don't have to look it up?" In the meantime, we did do some exercises:

**Warm-Up**

- 20 SSH, IC
- 10 Windmills, IC
- 15 Mountain climbers, IC
- 20 Merkins

**Thang 1**

- Hand-release merkins
- Jump squats
- Plank jacks
- Tuck jumps
- Peter Parker merkins
- Diamond merkins

**Thang 2**

Shortened Esau's ladder

- Backwards run up the hill from the bus loop
- 2 wide-grip merkins
- Regular run back down the hill
- 2 squats
- Repeato adding 2 to each exercise for each trip
- Stop at the top at 8 due to time

**Thang 3**

- Mosey back to flag, stopping for 10 diamond merkins at each light pole

**Mary**

**Prayers/Praises**

- No spoken prayers but we all have something on our minds so let's remember that as we go about our daily lives.

YHC took us out. Always a pleasure and an honor to lead the fine men of Carpex.
