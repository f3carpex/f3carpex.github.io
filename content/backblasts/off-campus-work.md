A muggy Friday at the original Cary (before CarPex) AO.  It was 77 with nearly 100% humidity.   Site Q Large planted the flag and the men began to gather.   Welcome Big Bird (my boy), Puck and Viking from 20 somethings from the ITB and as well as Kotter Billy.   Great to have Billy back.  Loom is also back in the rotation, too...which is awesome.   22 Pax.

I decided to showcase a little different location this am...but heading off campus away from the dark trails of North Cary Park.

**Warm Up**

- Half Lap around the pickle with a backwards run at the end.
- Head to BB courts.

- Merkins,  plank jacks, SSH, Hill Billy's, SSH,  Little Baby  JJ's, Cotton Pickers and Good Mornings.   Various random counts.   15-20-10.
    - Rip and Angry Elf planned their tribes entire fall Y Guides agenda during the warm up...did not count once.  You will be separated next time.

**NMS**

- Great squad this am.    Good to workout with y'all....treat having my son Big Bird and pals.
- Ollie was putting in strong extra credit hill work in the office park as I scouted it out pre-work out.  Beast.

Great starting the day with you men.   Sets a terrific foundation.
