... at least that's the joke around our house lately. Our downstairs furnace hasn't worked in almost two weeks, as some of you have heard me 'vent'. The first replacement part didn't arrive for a week, then they installed it wrong and it failed within a few hours. Now we're waiting for a replacement for the part and the installer! I'm trying to be nice, but the M lost patience long ago. So, I post to get warm and enjoy a 'cup a joe' with my buds.

As always, it is a pleasure seeing you guys in the gloom or where ever our paths cross!

**Warm-up**

Mosey across the street to physical therapy office, but they were closed so did some warm-up exercises instead:

- Tappy Taps
- Windmill
- Mountain Man poopers
- Calf Stretch
- Merkins

Â **Thang 1**

Jog over to the well lighted Publix parking lot, where you could also smell the bakery going full steam. Donuts, yum!

Four corners, escalating reps: 1 + 5 + 10 + 15 + 20 = **51**! My favorite number.

- Jump lunges
- Star fish
- Plank jacks
- Imperial Walkers
- Burpees

**Thang 2**

'Catch me if you can' around Publix parking lot.

**Mary**

Jog back to flag and work the core!

- LBC
- PP Merkins
- American Hammer
- Pickle Pounders
- Homer to Marge
