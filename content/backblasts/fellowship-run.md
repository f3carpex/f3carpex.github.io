Three PAX met in the yellowish gloom for a 3 mile fellowship run. We started with the disclaimer and pledge, then jogged through downtown Apex while getting to know each other. Stopping at the Train Station, we soaked up some the history while doing 7s with star fish and burpees. On to Bounty Hunter's, but no one was there -- we were too early. Circling back to the Apex PD parking lot, we did more 7s with merkins and squats. Finally back through town to Sovereign Grace for some pull-ups and a nice cool-down walk.
