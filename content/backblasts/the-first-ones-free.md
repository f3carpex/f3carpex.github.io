An early morning HIDA alert from YHC, Disco Duck, Water Wings and Snots for meeting in the FMJ Gloom a little early to knock out 100 Burpees. Why? Why not, I guess. Being that we're team players... we saved a few for our F3 Brothers.

The PAX arrive, it's a 10-count to start, great to see Grease Monke...wait... where's he going? Half, did he arrive safe and sound?

OK, a 9-count for a H-E-L-L-O K-I-T-T-Y Q at the premier FREE Tuesday morning bootcamp in the 27523 zip code (more on the FREE part later).

Psst... it's Half Mary week (so note the attempted 13 counts)

**Warm-up:**

- Head over to the Hope Church lot... looks kind of dry over there
- 10 Burpees for our brothers
- Good morning x 13

    - 1x5 (Merking to Shoulder Press)
    - 2x9
    - 3x15... etc up to 10x41
    - Oh hey the guy from the car comes over at the 9-count. "You guys friends or something? What is this?" A quick mumble and welcome Mike to finish out the beat down with us. Oh, Mike, we start at 0530... 10 penalty burpees for the Pax.
    - **Early NMS:** It ends up Mike is starting a Camp Gladiator that will workout at the Church on Tuesdays at 0530. No one showed up because of the weather. Seems like a legit workout group... #smh. Sidenote, Mike offered all of us to come out for FREE the first time. What a mench!!!
