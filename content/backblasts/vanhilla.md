Date:  June 22, 2018

Weather:    110 degrees, humid, clear

11 Pax gathered at the original Carpex AO.

**Warm Up:**  Mosey to bottom of the pickle.  Circle up for standard warm up of SSH, GMs, Cotton Pickers, Hell if I knows, merkins, plank jacks.

**Thang:**   Dealers Choice Pearls on a String.    Head to the fork in the trail.    One pax calls a move and we do said move 15x, then we run a bit and then another pax calls a move we do said move 15x plus the first pax's move 15x....we did this for every pax, although we did modify the x to 10x about 1/2 way through.   Lots of great exercises were called...but I don't remember what they were.

Our pearls on a string route was down the hill to bridge where we turned right and stopped at the bottom of the hill for some vanhilla work.  Increasing number of manmakers at the bottom as we run up the hill where we would wait on the pax (squat hold), then a few burbees.   Back down to the bottom for the manmakers...we did the hill 5 times.    It was fun.

We stayed at the top and ran on the road, through the construction site and continued the pearls on a string until we made it to the parking lot.     We had 11 pax so we did up to 11 moves...adding one each time.   Started with 15x and then audibled to 10x to finish right on the button.

Mary (1 move...can't remember it)
