- **When:** January 19th, 2018
- **QIC:** Earhart
- **The PAX:** 187, Pikachu, Lucky Charms, DoubleD, Term Paper, Disco Duck, Banjo, Shut-In, Banana Seat, Puddles, Slide Rule, Dog Pound, Dead Bolt, Buford, R22, Gump, Webex, Draper, Dauber, Brexit, Nemo, YHC Earhart

It’s was icy, the roads were questionable, the radio news programs were all doom and gloom, and YHC was up early determined to represent our Carpex brothers in South Wake.  I headed out from Apex, driving carefully, minding my lanes and looking for that elusive black ice, but, the path to Cletus turned out to be fine and YHC had no issues getting to the AO, outside the 6 foot high speed breakers.  Several PAX mosey out from their warm cars to gather at the flag while a larger group come out from around the small shelter after what I am sure was some inspiring 3rd F.  All said 22 PAX gather for a guest Q, time to run around the parking lot and to the far end for (watch out for the black ice!!!):

## Warm Up

Good mornings

Side Straddle Hops

Cotton Pickers

Hillbillies

## The Thang

Done with the warm-up, Q is now ready to mosey to parts unknown, using a tried and true traveling jack webs to get us there.  Given there is so much cold, white stuff around, I decided to travel using Lt.Dan’s, a combo squat with a number of jump lunges.  We head around the park, again careful of the black ice, to the parking lot behind the rock pile.  Q instructs PAX to partner up, size and speed does not matter, and perform partner merkins, running around the parking lot and when you meet you perform a partner merkin, finishing with 7 total.

Finished with those and a couple of pick-up the sixes we finish our traveling Lt. Dan’s next to the baseball field.  Now it is time for some 7s, running from one light pole to the next, performing escalating burpees with descending star jumps.  Much chatter about running in the snow but Q thought the HIM needed the extra plowing and pushing for a more complete workout.

Finish there and head back to aforementioned rock pile for some much needed rock work.  Q calls out the usual curls for girls, overhead extensions, tri-extensions, and rock rows, switching rocks between each set so that no one was cheated out of using Pikachu’s small boulder.  3 rounds of pain later and much consternation with which direction is left and how many rocks do I count, we return the rocks to their chilly home.

Now, we need to return to the parking lot and how best to get back than with traveling jack webs!!  Because we are sufficiently warm at this point, Q calls for Captain Thor’s, a combo of big boy sit-ups with a set number of American hammers.

Bell tolls 6:30 and time to finish.
