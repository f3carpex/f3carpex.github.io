**Warm-up** Sadly Aretha Franklin died yesterday. We did not do a themed workout but to honor the Queen of Soul we did do a themed warm-up from her song “Think” with mixed results and lots of feedback from the PAX: Two laps around the pickle **T** - Travolta's - Basically a plank with a Saturday Night Fever dance move with your arm. **H** - Hillbillie's **I** - Iron Mike's - This was a fail **N** - Nadal's - Sprints on the court **K** - Kraken Merkin's - Burpee with 3 merkins at the bottom. Disliked but effective and will come back.

Mosey over to the soccer fields.

**Thang 1** Burt mentioned sometimes the sprinklers are on but we found it was clear today. As an added plus, the grass was freshly cut and left behind for us to inspect as we got down and rolled around together. After a visit to Churham earlier this week and spending some time reading a few B.B., YHC came across something they did called Super 21 and felt the PAX would like to try it in Carpex.

We all lined up on the wide side of the soccer field and ran to the other side, and did one Merkin and one Boxcutter. PAX ran back to the start for two Merkins and two Boxcutters. This process went on until the PAX built up to 21 Merkins and 21 Boxcutters. To give a break, the PAX started doing 10 squats at the 10,12,14,16,18, and 20 intervals.

Just an FYI, If you add these and the merkins from the warm up, each of the PAX have done 261 merkins!!

**Thang 2**

The clock was getting close to the end but we had enough time to run to the playground and fit in 20 derkins, 20 urkins, and 20 pull-ups.

As we entered the area we came across a guy and a girl doing yoga in the middle of the playground. They had mats and all sorts of stuff lying about and either we were in the wrong place or they were. We are quite confident it was them. We thought about trying to EH the guy but the look of fear in his eyes seeing all the sweaty and grass covered PAX made it clear he wanted to stay in the park with the girl burning incense and doing downward dog. Everyone attacked the playground with a vengeance and made quick work of the to-do list.

Counting derkins and urkins in the merkin camp, each of the PAX have now broken through to **301 MERKINS!!**

**Mary**

All headed back to the Flag for some Mary and enjoyed a fine selection of PAX led exercises. Leprechaun did try to call Have a Nice Day a bit early and was rebuked for doing so but he rallied for a strong finish.
