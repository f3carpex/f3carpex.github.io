15 HIM including my 2.0 Ninjago join me on my special day for a Dante’s beatdown.  T-claps to Pivot for letting me take his anniversary spot for my day.  The weather is perfect, under 70 degrees with a cooling mist in the breeze.  5:45 rings and we begin with the pledge allegiance.  Off we go down toward the circle, but wait, we hit the brakes and head back by the flag and up the hill, mixing in high-knees, butt kickers, karaoke, and backwards run to the basketball court for:

## Warm Up

Good mornings

Cotton Pickers

Overhead Claps

SSH on MY cadence

Hillbillies

 

## The Thang

Done with the warm-up, we have a handy line that breaks the PAX into two groups (too early for count-offs).  First group line-up on the fence, second group on the line for, the PAX guessed it, two rounds of suicides and flapjack BTTW.

Sufficiently gassed, who knew it was so hard to catch your breath in the BTTW position, Q calls for some Bobby Hurlies since we are on a court.  Did notice several PAX did not sink one basket, must be NC State players.

Done here we head out the court and around the corner for some fence work x2, dips, irkins and quick feet, heading down the hill while stopping on the fence.  Down with those we head toward the nature park, with some crawl bear down the bridge (too slippery for bear crawl).  Some PAX just dragged their feet instead of crawling, to each his own.

After a quick plank hold with some six/two inch holds we head over to the rock pile.  Q instructs all PAX to get an ego rock and circle back up for two rounds of curls, overhead presses, tricep extensions and rock rows.  To be fair to everyone we rotate two rocks to the left to be able to enjoy someone else’s definition of ego.

We drop our rocks and head around the pond to the pull-up bars for two rounds of 5-count exercises.  T-claps to Parker for his leadership to keep us from standing around, calling merkins to keep us moving.

Back to the rocks, we do another two rounds of the above exercises switching to different rocks then put them back where we found them.  Head back around the pond for one last round of pull-ups.  Theissman can never get enough pull-ups, even after EC.

Run back to the bridge and call for lunge walking waws called but it was too slippery so we did a modified mosey walk with squats.  Squat hold at the top for the 6 then mosey to the shelter for some step-ups, irkins, dirkins, and dips.

We still have some pain time so we head to the pickle-ball court for a ten-count down the line with people’s chair.  During the ten-count we perform empty-handed wonderbras.  16 PAX with a ten count was tougher than I thought.

Done on the court we head back to the flag and circle up for:

 

## Mary

PAX-led Mary included

Parker calling Peter Parkers (yes it can work your core)

Frisco with some hammers

Sooey for some LBCs

Wrapping up with Ninjago calling some cockroaches

 

Bell tolls 6:30 and time to finish.
