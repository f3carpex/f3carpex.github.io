Two handsome young men showed up to Rush Hour in beautiful downtown Cary, one for a BRR taper, one just seeing if he can still lead a workout.

**Warm-Up** Lap around the parking lot and line up for side straddle hops, arm twirlies, imperial walkers, arm twirlies in reverse and Good Evenings.

**The Thang** Mosey over to the secret rock pile behind the community center for some rock work, mixed in with a run up the deceptively steep driveway.

Mosey over to the parking deck for a run to the top, stopping at each end to add a new exercise. By the time we reached the top we were doing merkins, LBCs, copperhead squats, shoulder taps, Supermans and Freddy Mercs.

**Mary** Mosey to the pocket park for LBCs and Have A Nice Day just in time for the bell.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  2 **Name-a-rama**:  1 almost RESPECT, 1 almost not HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for good weather and safety for the folks running BRR, prayers for kids and teachers adjusting to virtual schooling. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**  Thanks to Kermit for coming out and supporting YHC in my first Q in six months. No better place to do it than Rush Hour.
