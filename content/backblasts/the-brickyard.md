The Brickyard.  

Following along with the message from last week YHC sees F3 as a way for all PAX to challenge themselves to prepare for whatever comes their way. The pavers at first did not feel heavy and were laughed at by some PAX.  However just as in life what starts easy can sometimes derail and turn difficult quickly. To be Life Ready, we must push ourselves through new experiences and challenges. Overcoming these life obstacles provides us the knowledge and strength to rebound when life takes a turn in a direction we had not foreseen. So what do bricks have to do with this, I do not know.  Happy to have that experience in the books and bricks moved to a new home at Ascot's house.
