Scooped this one on Wednesday from Pet Sounds - and I was hoping to craft a workout that he would be proud of. Let's see how we did...

FNG Check - WE HAVE ONE!

Disclaimer... during which I remembered the F3 Mission Statement, but not the fact that I'm not a professional. d'oops

Head out toward the greenway 10 merkins OMD at the entrance to the greenway Head out and make a left toward the underpass. Stop once along the way for 15 merkins. Continue and then stop at the underpass for 20 merkins. Partner up on the way up the hill to Kildare Farm.

CMIYC to get to the parking lot of the Hemlock Bluffs Nature Preserve with 10 merkins.

At the parking lot - 200 Jump Squats/200 American Hammers/200 Calf Raises while partner runs the pickle.

Up the steps and back into the true gloom to the kumbayah circle for a round of Dips/Erkins/ALRSU/Derkins.

 

Mosey back out to the road. A gift to the PAX with an ALL YOU GOT down the hill.

 

Mosey back to the greenway for a Crawl-Bear Indian Crawl down the hill. One round of that because it sucked.

 

Mosey back toward the flag stopping once for 25 merkins.

 

Arrive at the flag for the clock to strike 6:30. THAT'S IT.

 

COR - 22

NOR - 3 RESPECTs, 19 meh

 

Announcements

BRR signup sheet on Slack Christmas Party 6-10 on 12/13 Operation Sweet Tooth - let's get 100 toys, due 12/9

 

Prayer Requests

Denali’s nephew Everett in the hospital to find cause of seizures WKRP's F-I-L been at Duke for a couple weeks - MRIs, losing weight & don’t know why Shank’s coworkers M June - non-smoker Lung cancer, recovering from surgery Joe Smith - HS Youth Group is ending Mufasa - friends coworker committed suicide

 

 

NMS

Always fun to hit a new location. Next level would have been to trek the trails at the HBNP, but spending 30 minutes just getting there and back makes that a tall task.

 

I took a Denali prayer request and then enjoyed Joe with Joe in his presence... but still forgot him in the PAX count at the time of this backblast-drafting. WTH brain.

 

Have we not struck GOLD with Hello Kitty and the new podcast?? Proud to be a part of Carpex, this is a REGION for sure.

 

Awesome to launch the morning with y'all today. I had three meetings at work in the AM that I was super nervous about, but conquering those 3 miles with you made the tasks seem small. I appreciate you all and respect you immensely.
