Memorial Day 2020 - Normally there is a convergence in F3 Carpex but not this year thanks to COVID-19. Multiple workouts were held and @Theismann put out a call that all AO's be Q'd by a Vet. That was a good idea and very appropriate.

YHC started thinking about what hero would be honored. The quick and obvious choices were my FIL or his West Point classmate Nick Rowe (Five Years to Freedom - His story of being a Vietnam POW). When, right on the television, a Memorial Day special showcased a more recent American Hero, Major Doug Zembiec. Like many American hero's in the past 20 years, Doug was a true patriot and gave everything he had to the Marine Corps and at the time of his death, the Central Intelligence Agency.  
Doug was on a mission with the CIA on May 11, 2007 when he was killed in action. Prior to his death, he was credited with saving the lives of 25 men. It is amazing how heros are created in every generation, in every war, and in everyday life right here in America.

YHC was motivated to give the best effort possible in this Memorial Day workout, just like Major Zembiec and countless other hero's have done over the past 20 years.

Before NOR, YHC spoke about the herioc's of Major Zembiec and reviewed some of his most common quotes (see NMS). TAPs was played to remember the fallen.

**NOR**: 2 respects, 3 hates, 4 mehs

**Announcements:** - Q Source training Monday's at A-Team

@Mohawk took us out.

**NMS**: This country has a long history of producing hero's that are willing to serve, lead, fight and yes die for this country. Hearing the story of Major Zembiec definitely put my daily struggles into perspective.  

**Major Zembiec's most famous quotes:**  
Be a man of principle.  Fight for what you believe in.  
Keep your word.  Live with integrity.  
Be brave.   Believe in something bigger than yourself.  
Serve your country.  Teach. Mentor.  
Give something back to society.  Lead from the front.  
Conquer your fears.  Be a good friend.  
Be humble and be self-confident.  
Be a leader and not a follower.  
Be valorous on the field of battle.  
Never forget those that were killed.  
And never let rest those that killed them.
