## Preamble

Last time I signed up to Q Gran Torino, there were some shenanigans. I felt bad about pulling the wool over the PAX' eyes with that masterful switcheroo in our annual Ninja Q Swap. So when I saw the opening on the Q sheet right after New Year's I jumped on it to make amends. The pre-blast was apparently just ominous enough that a couple of PAX decided to ruck instead. Mama always said: if you're skirt, say you're skirt. 10, nay, 11 accepted the challenge - including 2 FNGs Biner EH'd at Prodigal's NYD party.

## Warm-Up

At 0545, we took off - without a disclaimer - around the school out into the neighborhood and over to the Circle on the Green. Reminded that YHC had forgotten the disclaimer, I proceeded to deliver it. And not well either. Probably one of the reasons, I was ousted from the throne on Bloody Friday in May 2019. Either way, here's what we did:

- 5 GM IC
- 10 Mountain Climbers IC
- 10 Merkins IC

## The Thang

Set of BLIMPS around the circle increasing the distance around to the successive intersections with each addition of an exercise. The only gotcha: we did 6 Squats back at the starting point after each set. Apparently that was as hard to understand as how to calculate where coffeeteria is. After the 6 was in, we proceeded along Preston Village Way (or whatever) up to Morrisville Pkwy, stopping at each of 8 intersections for Crazy 8s - starting with 7 Groiners and 1 HR Merkin. The intent was to finish at Morrisville Pkwy with 1 Groiner and 7 HRMs. Apparently there are more than 8 intersections. Damn you Google! No worries, we kept at it by counting back down until we reached the end of the road. Squats until 6 were in then mosey over to the intersection with Louis Stephens. Squats until the 6 was in.

YHC had counted earlier - an even 10. That never happens. Partner up fo...Pivot? Where did Pivot come from? Now we have 11. This is why we can't have nice things. No worries, one team of 3. Catch me if you can with 2 burpees back to the flag. Circle back to PUT6 then when we reach the driveway to the parking lot, AYG to the flag, and circle up. The Ruckers arrived right on time and joined the boot campers for:

## Mary

- Pamela Andersons
- Flutter Kicks
- Hey Girls
- Hundreds

## COT

- Count-a-rama (15) - 11 campers; 4 ruckers
- Name-a-rama (5 RESPECTS, 9 Mehs, 1 Hate)
- Announcements: K2C
- Prayers: Hot Spot, Unspoken
- BOM: YHC took us out

## NMS

- Welcome FNGs Toothless and Ghost Pepper
- Apparently we already have a Toothless? At least one was in Slack and has been in a BB before. Could be a naming fail.
- Am I the only one doing the Krispy Kreme Challenge? The PAX looked at me like I had a 3rd eye when I announced it. You GTers need to tighten up.
- Biner warned me the night before that we'd have 1 and possibly 2 FNGs. The smell of merlot immediately filled my nostrils. Alas, it was not to be. They hung tough; hope they'll be back
- Coffeeteria was (insert fire emoji here)
- As always, it was a pleasure to lead you men. You all mean more to me than you know.
