F3 is a funny damn thing. Funny, in that most of us end up doing things that, a few weeks prior to our V-post, we'd have sworn we'd never do. Not that we couldn't do, but just wouldn't. Therein lies the truth in Sadclown syndrome. It's a real thing, but by the time you discover the truth of it, you should be well on the way to a cure.

When I look at the PAX names this morning, I see that several have only been posting for a few short weeks. This is proof that F3 is not only working, but it's accelerating. Because you're never staying the same - you are either accelerating or decelerating. We've got newer guys like Wahoo. On his first post, he came dressed head to toe in Virginia Tech gear (hellllloooooo Burt). Of course, when we got to naming I shouted out Wahoo and it stuck. His reaction was priceless. I gave it 50:50 if he'd show up again. Today, Wahoo is OWNING that name. Shouting it out in Name-o-rama. Not to mention killing the workouts. More guys like Chicken Little, Hamm and Short Circuit who have been posting a short amount of time, but are part of the Carpex brotherhood already. Headroom, he made a point to say he got that name because he was too young to know who Maxx Headroom was. I love him, and I hate him too.

F3 is here for all of us, but it's especially here for those guys who still need the cure to Sadclown Syndrome.

9 PAX gathered at the Lion's Den flag, wondering who the Q was. Including Sour Mash, who came in hot mumbling something about being awake a grand total of 8 minutes. YHC gladly grabbed the vacant Q slot. Disclaimer disclaimed, mission of F3 stated and allegiance pledged.

### Warm Up

Mosey to the entrance to the church, circle up for SSHs. Today there will be a lot of PAX participation, so YHC went around the circle asking the newer PAX to call a warm up. Pop up Q school, if you will.

### The Thang

Mosey to Town Side Drive, identify point A, the Bottom of the Hill, and point B. Double 11s called, PAX select Merkins and Squats for point A and point B exercises. At the bottom of the hill, we do ascending burpees up to 10, then descend back down.

When YHC hits 10 burpees, the clock is closing in so we PUT6 and head back toward the flag. The PAX, being freed to lead, make a stop at the trellis for some pull-ups. YHC calls one AMRAP set, then to the flag.

### Mary

Once again, PAX choice of Mary exercises. And even though QWERTY has the HFT Q tomorrow, I let him play along. Various Mary exercises are called, YHC calls Homer to Marge, and then the clock strikes.

### COT

- One respect, 8 mehs
- Announcements
- Prayer requests - remember Chicken Little's friend who suffered a spinal cord injury about 1 year ago. He has slowly regained some movement in his fingers and toes.
- Praise God that we have the ability to get after it in the gloom
- YHC took us out.

### NMS

The mission of F3 is to plant, grow and serve small workout groups for the invigoration of male community leadership. Always be looking for that next guy who doesn't know what he's missing.
