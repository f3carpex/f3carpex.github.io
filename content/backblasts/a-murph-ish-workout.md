This guy and Chanticleer for a little EC

Bells were grabbed, instructions were given, running was questioned.

**The Thang  
**Our workout was similar to a Murph in the sense that we ran a mile, did 3 exercises for a period of time, then finished with another mile. The 3 exercises were KB Merkin/Row combo; Goblet Squat; KB swing. We did sets of 5;10;15 respectively and repeated until we ran out of time. No one counted.

Praises for this group of HIM. No spoken prayers

YHC took us out with a quote from Patrick Henry
