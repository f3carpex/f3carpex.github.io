- Good fortune on the weather this morning -- 47 in February? Yes please!
- Happy to have Leprechaun and his buddy Bag Boy come out and celebrate with us.
- Thanks Burt, for the Natty Light, Fireball and pickles! (Although, I think those were technically gherkins. Need to research my pickle taxonomy. LOL)
- Thanks to Coney for the coffeeteria.
- Can't think of a better way to start another lap than leading you HIMs.
