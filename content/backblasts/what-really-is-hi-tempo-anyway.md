quckie backblast -- Ma Bell hyped the site as the best, Grease Monkey back for a one-night special, & lots of talk about how FMJ has gotten too tough as of late.... so, pressure on me to make sure the PAX were moving this fine morning.... with 15 seconds to spare, we said the pledge and did a sharp mosey down to the middle school parking lot dodging 3 Apex pick-up trucks on dawn patrol for some reason.... warm-up was:

Good mornings, windmills, hillbillies, merkins, etc -- we then went up the stairs to start

Thang #1: 5's -- Burpees at the bottom of the hill, Turkish Get-ups at the flag with a stop for 5 LBCs each time at the Stop sign.... gathered all up for a mosey to

Thang #2: jump the fence to access the middle school field, start at goal line for 10 yard bear craws with descending Jack Webbs -- covered the 100 wet & cool yards, then partnered up for:

Thang #3: P1 runs 1/2 up the back straightaway & back, P2 does alternating CDDs/Dying Cockroaches. flip-flop. Repeato 2 more times with different exercises, begin to make our way back to the flag with stops for

Mary on the run: LBCs, Freddy Mercs, etc. also got in a shuttle run between the light poles as Saban was itching for more mileage!

CoT: 28 including ruckers and IR bruisers -- great gang out to wish Grease Monkey the best.

P/P: PBX FIL, Saban's FIL, Grease Monkey mission & travel, others

NMS: loved watching but certainly not participating in Chanticleer & Prodigal racing on Thang #3 -- you guys are awesome! Terrific mix today of great men doing lots of stuff -- bootcamp, ruckers, bruisers -- it doesn't matter, all are getting better everyday. Big crew at coffee post too.... I love this group & hope you got your money's worth today!
