Some might say it was this PAX's Kryptonite. (see what I did there?)

**Warm Up**

Windmill, Imperial Walker, Steve Earle, SSH

**Thang 1**

Circled up in a nice patch of grass for Absolution. This is an 8 count cadence. Starting in plank position to a groiner, down to chill cut, plank jack, then back up. Trying to keep the PAX together on this one seemed to be a challenge. Not to mention no one was counting except me, so I'm not even sure how many we did. It's a great exercise, and I will definitely use it again so start practicing now.

We followed this with Hill Sprints x2.

**Thang 2**

It was off to the greenway and it's two bridges. Bridge #1 we bunny hoped across the bridge, and then with our feet on the top of the bridge's railing we shuffled back to the other side on our hands. At bridge #2 we repeated except we replaced hops with a lunge walk. Ran to end of the greenway.

**Thang 3**

Partnered up and did 4x4 (burpee w/ 4 merkins and 4 mnt climbers) Catch Me If You Can. We then did Suicides in the parking lot with jump squats and star jumps.

We will need to think of a cool name for this next one, but until then it's a "rope run." We all grabbed on to a long heavy rope and ran the length of the parking lot, down and back, holding the rope down, out to the side, and overhead.

We then repeated the suicides with merkins and overhead claps.

Indian run back to the flag. T-Claps to Old Maid for carrying said rope back.

(Total Milage = 3.3)

Just enough time for some Captian Thor x5
