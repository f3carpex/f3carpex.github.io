**Warm-Up** Mosey over to the Community Center parking lot and circle up for 22 side straddle hops and others. Callahan showed up late and salty so a few burpees thrown in.

**The Thang** Mosey down the hill to the bottom lot and partner up. One runs the pickle, the other alternates step-ups and dips. After a few rounds switch from dips to derkins.

Escalating merkins up the hill. Run to first light pole, 1 merkin, run back. Run to second light pole, 2 merkins, run back. Continue up to 7, then slowest Billy Run ever back to the flag.

**Mary** Homer-to-Marge, Freddie Mercury, calf stretches and Good Mornings.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  16 **Name-a-rama**:  5 RESPECT, 10 meh, 1 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**  YHC was looking to get more miles in, someone said we got close to three, not bad for a Clydesdale. Great having Uncle back in the gloom. Love you guys!
