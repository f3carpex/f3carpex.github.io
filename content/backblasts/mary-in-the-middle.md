Instead of leading us out in pray YHC felt called to speak on mental health battles. Too often men are taught to keep their struggles to themselves. The Truth is ok not to be ok especially in these tough times. YHC has been in the trenches with this before and happy to listen to anyone who needs an ear. Please lean on your brothers should you need, No On Your Own! [https://www.mhanational.org/infographic-mental-health-men](https://www.mhanational.org/infographic-mental-health-men)  

**NMS:** 

\-YHC typically forgets to say recover after warm-ups causing pax to joke, to remedy this YHC called a string of warm-ups that did not require a recover.

\-YHC started his strava shortly after the 2-minute warning and forgot about that so the workout ended at a very south wake 43 minutes, I apologize for the shortage RR.
