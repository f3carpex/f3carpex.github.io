This Guy! Largemouth, Denali and Wonderbread for some EC laps around the AO.

Today is a perfect example of never giving up on your dreams. I've waited for this day for 50 years and it finally happened. You see kids....

Great group of defiant HIM this morning for an early rollout of Phase 2. We ran, circled up, and celebrated the day of my birth with 5 Good Mornings; 19 Steve Earles; and 70 (IC) SSH.

**The Thang  
**4 cones were placed 100 yards apart around the track. After completing 50 reps of a called exercise we ran to a cone, increasing the distance of the run each time to a further cone. Called exercises were: Squats; American Hammer; (IC) Mnt. Climber; Shoulder Taps; (IC) Imperial Walker; CDD; (IC) Lo Slo Flutter; Crab Cakes

Ran out of time before Turkish Get-ups were called (you're welcome)

**Mary  
**100s

**COT  
**Praises for Hi-Liter's daughter and Red Ryder's son. Prayers for those PAX with small businesses that may be struggling and all those who may be having a tough time professionally because of the lockdown.

YHC took us out with a quote from Socrates

> "It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable"
