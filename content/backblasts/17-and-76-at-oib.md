With the men of Carpex set to demolish another 1776 workout, YHC and Carpex seniority Burt set out to host a beatdown worthy of our nation's birthday celebration for DR Pax at Ocean Isle Beach.

The Carpex regulars (reg-you-larz) in-toe included: YHC, Burt, Half, Open-Out and Flacco, with a tip o' the cap to Big Bird and Viking, also on-hand.

As it should be, we launched from the OIB pier at 0704 with YHC taking the lead out the gate (in full RW&B regalia, ta boot).

**The Warmup:**

- 1776 yard run (Just a sand flea over 1 mile) w/ the shovel flag and America-themed tunes on the bluetooth speaker
- When back, over the walk-way and onto the sand for a Flacco-lead warm-up circle

**The Thang 1, YHC Q:**

- Partner up for:
    - 17 partner merkins and 76 squats (shared), run to flag and back
    - 17 bropees and 76 LBCs (shared), run to flag and back
    - 17 partner derkins and 76 lunges (shared), run to flag and back

**The Thang 2, Burt Q:**

- To the pier for 7's of squats and star jumps
- But every time back at the pier, 2 burpees
- Circle up for plank and tell us your F3 nickname
- Back on knees for J-Webbs of 4 (16), 6 (24), 8 (32), 17 (76)

Mary-stuff
