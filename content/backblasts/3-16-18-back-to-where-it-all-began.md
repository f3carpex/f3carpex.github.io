YHC felt obliged to celebrate his 2 year anniversary by Q-ing the AO where it all began for him (at least in the Carpex Region).

The Warm-Up: Some vanilla warm up including 24 merkins, 104 SSH, and some other stuff. The Thang 1: - Form 2 lines, bear crawl inchworm down the parking lot - Crawl bear inchworm back up the parking lot The Thang 2: - Partner Up for Dora 1, 2, 3 - 100 Burpees, 200 Squats, 300 Calf raises on the stairs while the other partner runs down the trail and keeps turning righ. The Thang 3: - BTTW till failure then LBCs, repeat

There were some announcements and prayer requests and Banjo provided some insight on the "Why" of F3.Â  YHC took us out.

NMS: Thanks men for a great 2 years!
