Our brother Chinese Downhill was scheduled to Q at Dante's Peak this morning, but something came up and he needed someone to cover for him. We talked this week about picking up the six, here it is in action. Trike agreed to take the Q, and asked YHC to co-Q with him, so let's go.

**Warm-Up**

23 pax make our way down to the circle at the end of the parking lot and circle up for side straddle hops. While in progress #24 (Two Factor) arrives. We start at 5:45, not 5:46, so let's do a few burpees. Follow it up with hillbillies, cotton pickers, a few more burpees, good morning, and a few more burpees. Gotta make sure the pax are nice and warm before handing them off to Trike.

**The Thang** Trike takes over and quickly arranges the pax into three groups (fast, slow and medium) for modified sevens. Indian run to the other end of the parking lot for seven burpees, Indian run back for 25 LBCs, repeato dropping one burpee each trip, and keeping the LBCs at 25 every time.

When all three groups are finished we mosey over to the middle of the soccer field and partner up, each partner sprint to opposite sidelines, bear crawl back, and do 25 partner sit-ups.

With time running out we mosey back to the flag and YHC leads us through American hammers, box cutters, then Red Ryder finishes us off with standard merkins, on his down AND on his up.

**COT**

**Count-a-rama**:  24 **Name-a-rama**:  3 RESPECT, 19 meh, 2 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for Ausfahrt recovering from a motorcycle accident, prayers for safe travels for Sooey next week in London. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**

Welcome FNG Duncan!

Red Ryder and Hotty Toddy knocked out EC pull-ups before the beatdown.

YHC was in the medium group for the Indian run sevens. Ninjago was there, even though his dad was in the slow group. FNG Duncan was also there, not taking it easy on his first day out.

Mumble chatter was strong during warm-ups, but dropped quickly once the running and burpees started. I told y'all Trike wasn't messing around.

I call on Red Ryder for the last exercise of the day, looking at him and just knowing he knows to call burpees, and instead he calls merkins. Still don't believe it.

Trike started us early just so it would make Two Factor late and get me to call burpees, but we were gonna do those burpees anyway.

Jayhawk was there, two days after his first post, ready to get after it again.

Thanks to Trike for stepping up to cover this Q, and for asking me to help out. Thanks to the rest of you for letting us lead.
