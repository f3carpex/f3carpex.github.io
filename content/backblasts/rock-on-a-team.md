Strong showing of 14 PAX at A-team on the launch day of another new Carpex AO.  I wasn't sure what kind of attendance to expect after all the hype surrounding the first day of Wolverine, but you can always count on allure of one of Carpex's original workouts.  No hype, no nonsense, not even a Twitter account.  Just hard work and clean livin'.
