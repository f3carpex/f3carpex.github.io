3 valiant PAX posted yesterday morning in the monsoon. While Jango Fett couldn't handle the rain, Silver Fox, Deuce, and YHC could. Once we embraced the rain, it all got better...until the workout started. FIA was out in force, we looked pretty pitiful (but fierce) with our small merry band of warriors. Here's what we did:

"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; because there is not effort without error and shortcomings; but who does actually strive to do the deed; who knows the great enthusiasm, the great devotion, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly. So that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat."

- Some guy named Theodore Roosevelt
