Wild Wild West 12/14

QIC: Flenderson

PAX: Hamm, Chicken Little and Disco Duck

YHC had planned to do a F3 Classic 12 days of Christmas routine but hearing it was done a few times last week brought a change of plans. My favorite Christmas episode of the office has Dwight shares his Pennsylvania Dutch traditions. I wanted to dive into these in this Q.

Belsnickel would ask each child if they had been naughty over the past year; an honest admission of guilt would earn you a rap on the knuckles, but lying resulted in an even worse punishment! Once every child had been judged, each was asked to recite a prayer or prove something they had learned in school to earn a small treat from Belsnickel’s bag.
