Michelob and YHC for a little EC

Posting at Bradford's Ordinary yesterday I was "inspired" by Burt's shared cluster Q. To the untrained eye, it may have seemed like he was unprepared but he was, in fact, helping to shape and invigorate. What, I'm not actually sure, but there was definitely shaping and invigorating going on. And it seemed to work. So I borrowed his lackadaisical Qing style and implemented it at DAC.

So after meeting a few new guys we were off for a little mosey to warm up.

**Warm-Up  
**Circle up for Good Mornings, Windmill, SSH, Steve Earle, Mnt. Climber, Merkins, Arm Circles, Seal Clap, Overhead Clap, Moroccan Night Club.

**Thang 1  
**Mosey to the bottom of entrance for 5 reps of a Q called Star Jump. Run to the top of the entrance for 10x Honeycomb called LBC, followed by Star Jumps. Cross the street into the neighborhood for 15x The Joker called squats, followed by LBCs and Star Jumps. Run to the first turn for 20x Crimson called Merkins followed by Squats, LBCs and Star Jumps. Run to next turn for 25 Duece called Monkey Humpers, followed by Merkins, Squats, LBCs and Star Jumps. Run to the next turn for 30x Bubba called Dying Cockroaches, followed by Monkey Humpers, Merkins, Squats, LBCs, and Star Jumps.

**Thang 2  
**Partner up for Catch Me If You Can with 15 CDDs. When finished we were led for a 35 IC SSH by Sooey. Break up into two groups for a Scout Run back to the first turn. Getting short on time we Moseyed as a group back to the flag stopping at the turns to either hold squat or PUT6

**Mary**  
Arriving about 1 minute late, we skipped Mary and went right into COT

**COT**  
Announcements: F3 Raleigh CSAUP The Mule is Saturday; Carpex PAX still running Tobacco Road on Sunday. Details for both on Slack.  
Prayers/Praises: Continued prayers for everyone dealing with this virus, especially those on the front lines and making tough decisions.

YHC took us out with an anonymous quote:

> "Peace does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, no trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart."
