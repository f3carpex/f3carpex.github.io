Great temps, 14 PAX, no lights, no FNGs but still give the disclaimer and we are off

**Warm up** mozy

SSH x20

IW x15

GM x10

Fazio routine

Merkins, Plankjacks, MC x 15

**Thang**

Catch me if you can with HR merkins to parking lot entrance

Lindsays (aka 40s) on the hill with merkins at the top and squats at the bottom. Start with 30/10, decrease/increase by 5 until you get to 10/30

Mozy to the pond and find a rock for you and your partner. One partner lunge walks with rock, other runs opposite direction. Flap jack until rock makes it back to the start.

Run to upper lot for moving jack webb with burpees and squats 1 to 3 ratio. Increase burpee by 1 at each light pole.

Knock out M**ary** while we are together.

LBCs x 20

Hammers x 20.

Back to the shovel flag for low plank 5 count around the circle.

**Announcements**

Hi-liter coordinating ID bracelet opportunity. Michelob knows about them, but doesn’t have one.

Forgot one I think

**Prayers**

Hi-liter’s father

Mufasa’s mother and her daughter

Friends and family of the Green Hope student and all young people that are hurting inside

Did I forget one here too?

**NMS**

What happened to the lights? This place is usually super bright, but it was Wolverine-like at the gathering spot.

WWW is one away from his 1st 6-pack. Strong work brother!

Thanks to Pet Sounds and Squatter for letting me tri-partner up with them. Next time, I will look for slower partner(s)

We kept it moving and GTL clocked us with 3.2 miles. Nice work men, because we also did about 150 merkins, lots of squats, more than a few burpees and some other stuff

Posted with Shut-in on b2b days except I have yet to see him do anything other than plank for a few seconds. I have a feeling that kettle bell he has been toting around is for show. He claims to have been bear crawling the bridge waiting for us, but there were no witnesses.

Always great to post outside of my normal AO routine and put F3 names with faces - Imp, Blueprint and Chum.

Wilber - where ya been? Good to see you out!

If you skipped coffeteria, you definitely missed out. Crimson goes from a deep discussion about socio-economic issues to Sooey getting rushed to the hospital after doing too car bombs. I won’t do the story justice so you will have to get the details yourself.

Bring some cash if you are going to Shutty’s Brew n Q 2nd F event. He won’t take your money personally, but donations will be accepted to help the friend who was badly hurt in the fire and lost all of his worldly possessions.

Q fail at the end, as I forgot to name myself and then proceeded to butcher the process once Monkey Nut reminded.

Always an honor to lead. MIAGD
