20 HIMs were kind enough to show up on this glorious day to see what YHC had in store for them. Full disclosure, I signed up for this Q before this AO went high tempo and really just to get that Q-zie. Parker mentioned last week that his wife was Qing at FIA and doing the 12 days of Christmas as a theme for her workout and that sounded like a great idea so let's go!

**Warmup**:

YHC didn't get to the AO early enough for any EC running so we took the long way around the back of the school to the first parking lot big enough to fit all the PAX for some:

SSH x 15 IC

Good Mornings x 10 IC stopping on last rep to focus on each side plus a little extra push down the middle.

Imperial Walkers x 10 IC

Plank Jack x 10 IC

Mountain Climbers x 10 IC

Calf Stretch L-R

**Thang 1**:

Head from the school back towards the stop sign at Old Jenks Rd stopping at every light pole for star jumps. Start with 2 increasing by 2 at each.

**Thang 2:**

Cross Old Jenks into the parking lot for the main event. 12 Days of Schlitz-mas! Picture provided above, but on the first day of Schlitz-mas, my Q gave to me, 1 Burpee! Then run the big pickle and on to the next day. I'm sure everyone is familiar with how the song goes. Here's a list of all the exercises though just in case:

1 Burpee

2 Side Straddle Hops (IC)

3 Hand Release Merkins

4 Dying Cockroaches (IC)

5 Homer to Marge (IC)

6 Hillbilly Squats (IC)

7 Supermans

8 Monkey Humpers

9 Star Jumps

10 Squat Jumps

11 LBCs

12 Jump Lunges

Unfortunately we only were able to get through 9-10 rounds before it was time to head back to the flag for some Mary.

**Mary**:

LBCs x 15 IC

Low Slow Flutter x 10 IC

R Elbow to L Knee x 10 IC

L Elbow to R Knee x 10 IC

American Hammers x 10 IC

Have a nice day!

**Announcements**:

Oakwood 24, Saturday 3pm- Sunday 3pm. Come out and run, walk, ruck, or just hang out. Please donate for a good cause through slack.

**NMS:**

Thank you all again for the opportunity to lead. While I wouldn't typically consider myself "high-tempo" typically, I made a conscious effort to try and push my pace so today's workout would be a challenge for even the fittest of the PAX. I hope I accomplished that. I apologize we ran out of time before completing all 12 days, but it appeared as though everyone seemed thoroughly challenged which is all YHC could ask for. While small it still feels good to earn my Q-zie today. I look forward to my next opportunity to lead you men.
