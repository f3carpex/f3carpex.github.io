My first post was at Lion's Den on a Wednesday the week before Thanksgiving 2020, so I've been at F3 for a little over 3 months...and with 3 Q school sessions under my belt (shout-outs to Ma Bell, Disco Duck, and Red Ryder), I guess it was about time I tried my hand at Qing.

## Arrival and warmup

When your Nantan pre-blasts a VQ, I guess 19 guys (and 1 canine) show up to set a new site record, even on a 33-degree Monday morning with chance of rain. Lots of ECers, too, although YHC was not one of them.

No FNGs, but I restated the mission of F3 anyways. No late arrivals, so alas I shall save my carefully researched exicon _Alarm clocks_ penalty for a later date. After the pledge, we did a VQ-with-no-EC-paced mosey to an emptier parking lot for warmup.

- **Windmills**. There was some mumbling that the pace was brisk, but when I tried to slow it down after the eleven-count for the next twelve, the PAX thought I was signalling a halt. But one adapts.
- **Sir Fazio fwd & rev arm circles** with **Seal claps** thrown in the middle since Wahoo was there. x12-24-12 counts IIRC.
- **Plank jacks**, which I mistook as mountain climbers for a hot second, x24.
- **Calf stretch**, about a minute.

Mosey to the track for Thang 1.

## Thang 1 - The big hand of the clock

Very creatively, I took my inspiration for the VQ from my F3 name, so everything was a variation of running in circles and stopping for multiples of 12 exercises.

**Round One**

Had planned to do the rounds OYO, but after some took off running counterclockwise, we course-corrected this round to do the exercises together.

- 12 o'clock - 12 Merkins (on the down)
- 3 o'clock - 12 Merkins, 12 Bonnie Blairs (in cadence)
- 6 o'clock – 12 Merkins, 12 Bonnie Blairs, 12 Carolina Dry Docks (on the down)
- 9 o'clock – 12 Merkins, 12 Bonnie Blairs, 12 Carolina Dry Docks, 12 Squats (on the down) Backwards mosey to the 12 o'clock

**Round Two**

Reverse direction and OYO.

- 12 o'clock – 12 Squats,
- 9 o'clock – 12 Squats, 12 Carolina Dry Docks,
- 6 o'clock – 12 Squats, 12 Carolina Dry Docks, 12 Bonnie Blairs.
- 3 o'clock – 12 Squats, 12 Carolina Dry Docks, 12 Bonnie Blairs, 12 Merkins

Mosey back to the 12 o'clock and recover for a 12 count.

## Thang 2 - The little hand of the clock

Mosey to the doublewide basketball court. The intent was to do another round of clockwork, this time with a partner. Things fell apart a little (and again some Pax were running counterclockwise like we're in Australia or something). You'd think that since I'm a technical writer, I could give clear directions, but maybe it was just because I hadn't brought my schematics playbook.

**Round 1 - The idea**

- Partner 1 sprints from 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock (the first two corners) and does shoulder taps AMRAP while waiting for Partner 2.
- Partner 2 bearcrawls from 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock
- Partners flip-flop their way around the clock back to 12

After having to wind back the clock a few rounds, we eventually got the gist of it enough to attempt Round 2.

**Round 2**

- Partner 1 sprints from 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock (the first two corners) and does American hammers AMRAP while waiting for Partner 2.
- Partner 2 crabwalks from 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock. There was some discussion on whether one should crabwalk forwards-facing, backwards-facing, or sideways. I had intended we'd have separate rounds for each of those ways but realized we didn't have the time or the enthusiasm to complete such a crustacean undertaking.
- Partners flip-flop their way around the clock back to 12

Believe it or not, my original plan for Thang 2 was even more complicated.

## Back to the flag

With about 10 extra minutes on the clock, we stopped for some **Calf Raises** along the fence, which was a move lifted from a [Lookout Q from last week](https://f3carpex.com/2021/02/17/the-den-in-the-darkness/).

Then a **Zombie Walk** to burn out our quads the rest of the way to the flag. Track Star was asked by a Pax to sprint ahead and replant the flag closer, but he was too far ahead to hear by that point.

## Mary

A request for Homer-to-Marge was approved since it was already in the plan. The Pax were very chatty during this exercise. x24

A 72-second plank hold for the finisher. Riley particularly appreciated this move.

## COT

**Announcements**

- **New Parking for next week's Wild Wild West**: At the far end of the lot, to accommodate returning students
- **New AO - Piranha Park:** Softlaunch this Saturday at the site of Dante's Peak
- Reminder about **BRR** from Cataracts
- Speaking of mileage, put those miles to work ending human trafficking by joining the [**#end-it-challenge** details in Slack](https://f3carpex.slack.com/archives/C01METVNCJK)

**Prayers and praises**

- Praise for safe delivery of Repeato's daughter
- Prayer for Clockwork's relative in hospice

YHC took us out.

I really enjoyed getting to plan and lead a workout with all of you. Your encouragement has pushed me out of my comfort zone and helped me grow in multiple ways, and I've only been here a few short months. I think that is a great testament that the Carpex region carries out the F3 mission, and am grateful to have found this unique community.

**Postscripts**

It was nice to see so many at coffeeteria afterwards.

Steaks shared on Slack some video footage of a deer that unfortunately fell victim to the bus tunnel at the AO. The tunnel had been part of my rain contingency plan, so I am glad the rain held off until COT. Rest assured that no animals were injured in the making of the workout, as Riley can attest. Also, I hear Mr. Safety has already received several proposals to help prevent this in the future. But lightheartedness aside, everyone stay safe in the gloom.
