23 men embraced the gloom this morning to join in a birthday celebration at Bounty Hunters.  YHC must first apologize to the white Lexus SUV that was forced off of the road this a.m. and to the fine police force of Apex as a calculated and skillful pass was performed on the double yellow lines of our very safe downtown area.  YHC then arrived on 2 wheels, responsibly parked my truck in front of a fire hydrant, and jumped out to give the 1 minute announcement.  In the end, I'd say that I slid into BH this morning with the same grace and poise exhibited in my grand entry 32 years ago.

**Warm-Up** SSH IC x 32 GM IC x 10 IW IC x 15 Standard Merkin x 32 Plank Hold while we count by 2's for no odd reason Mountain Climbers IC x 15

**COT** **Announcements-** Monday night 7pm @ Bond Brothers:  Come meet Pastor Manoj from India.  He is doing a great work there for the women and children on the red light district of Mumbai.  His stories are worth hearing and will challenge your worldview and faith

**Prayer Requests-** Hi-Liter's Father (Mark) is going through chemo. He is currently on a break, so prayers for renewed strength and miraculous healing

**NMS -** YHC had an entire workout planned for the turf field, however the gate was locked **\-** Have we already worn out our welcome? **\-** There was lots and lots of sweat this morning, more sweat than mumble chatter **\-** I think Nature Boy regretted requesting Mary so early **\-** Many were thankful that I'm a young 32 this morning **\-** There was an attempt at a premature name-o-rama during the derkins. Someone mistakenly pronounced Pete too loudly when it came to Biner.  I finally learned his first name **\-** Great work this morning from some of our newer pax, I was impressed

Again, it was a great way to kick off a birthday.  Appreciate the opportunity to lead such great guys!
