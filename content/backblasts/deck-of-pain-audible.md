PAX: @Ausfaht @Bolton @Roasters @eHarmony @Shortcut @Billy @Meat Loaf @Ashbury @Sega @Zamboni @WWW

I stepped up to take the Q late Tuesday. I realized after waking up I didn’t have a plan and scrambled through ideas inspired by Bartman and brought a deck of cards to beat the guys down with. At home, I quickly organized a Winke, printed it, woke the baby, and proceeded to forget the Winke at home. What a morning!

STARTERS:

Bolton and YHC completed an EC run and upon the return to Cornerstone, the PAX was starting to pull in. Festivities kicked off at 5:30 AM without any FNG’s. We reviewed the F3 mission and core principles before doing our Pledge work. A slow warm up around the pickle was completed to kick off the limited run workout.

WARM UP:

A long good morning, 15 x Sir Fazio Arm Circles (Forward and Reverse), Imperial Walkers, Daisy Pickers, down to the ground for runners stretch and calf stretch, finished with 20x Standard Merkins 

MAIN EVENT

Deck of Pain with coupons

- Aces = 15 reps. Faces = 10 reps, all other cards are of value as shown.
- Hearts = cadence count flutter kicks, coupon overhead
- Diamonds = curls for gurls
- Clubs = overhead press
- Spades = squats

YHC was often found lost in thought while calling up, down, cadence counts. But the PAX corrected and things continued as planned. We ended up getting through all 52 cards and fitting in three mosey’s around the pickle. Two surprise jokers were saved for the end to get in some extra burpee work. There was some questionable “name that singer” answers from YHC and again the PAX corrected. Note to self, Billy Squire is not Led Zeppelin

A shared Mary was called with Homer to Marge, 100s, Dolly Partons, modified merkin touch each knee 8 count exercise (thanks @WWW) and we ended with having a nice day.
