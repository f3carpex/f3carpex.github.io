Phoenix has a special place in my heart as it was the site of my first VQ. Had I known that day that it was a 60 min bootcamp, I may have postponed joining Hi-Lighter as it also marked my first 6-pack. What a week that was 2 years ago!

Mumble chatter was solid, albeit owned by Tecumseh where we learned a bunch about health insurance. With that  6 others joined YHC for a Tour De Phoenix (Bond Park) and 2 rucked.
