**Who**:  Shut-In, Callahan, WKRP,...and YOU? **When**:  8:30pm-10pm TBD day **Where**:  http://whiteoakcoffee.com

**Learn the Ins and Outs of Wordpress and Other Online Tools** Callahan and WKRP have shown an interest in learning more about Wordpress so we are hosting a casual get together at a local coffee shop to go over the basics and learn more about optimizing a Wordpress site.  If time allows we'll go in to basic SEO as well and other online tools.

Topics May Include - Domain / hosting - Wordpress services - Dashboard Navigation - Apearance / Sidebars / Widgets - Plugins - Google - Other online tools

The idea will be to do a walk through of setting up your own website from scratch.  If you're interested DM me on GroupMe or Twitter (@mattcss\_)
