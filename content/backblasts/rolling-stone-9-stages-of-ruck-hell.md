As the GT HIMs headed out for their beatdown, we Mother Rucker's headed off to do our thang.

Circle up for a little warm-up. Rucked to starting point. QIC/YHC calls out our thang:

Rollingstone 9 stages of Ruck Hell - 9 reps of each exercise (goal: 4 rounds with some rucking distance in between each round)

Overhead squat

Lunges

Chest press

Shoulder front raise

Shoulder press

Curls for girls

Tricep extension

Ribbons

Coffin sit-ups

For the sake of time and getting back to COT on time QIC had to audible after the 3rd round.
