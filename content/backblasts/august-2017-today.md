I said to the PAX at Tortoise today - I cannot imagine my life if I didn't find F3 a short 5 years ago. It has meant so much to me, as I found new friends, pushed myself, laughed, looked outside myself, and pushed my boundaries. This workout was a celebration of those 5 years.

## The Workout

There is no magic or mystery to a Red Ryder workout. Most of the time, you can count on hitting all the major muscle groups while you continue to move for 45 minutes. We'll probably do some merkins, pull-ups, and squats in there. Strong chance for a bear crawl. Hell, we might even get a burpee or 2 in.

## Thang 1

Today we did a short run to warm up, then the standard Red Ryder warm up consisting of SSHs, sir fazio arm circles, steve earles, but also some stretching. Then we broke into 3 groups. Group 1 completes 10 pull-ups, Group 2 does LBCs, and Group 3 does squats. Rotate through each 3 times.

## Thang 2

Mosey across the street to a familiar short hill. Now we're gonna do 50s - the exercises are Merkins and Dying Cockroaches, and we count by 10s. The twist is that we Crawl Bear down the hill, and Bear Crawl up it. This was a good one.

## Mary

Finish it off with Captain Thor up to 8;32 when time ran out. Cause what is Tortoise without some WWIIs?

## COT

22 PAX, including a few Das Booters. Buncha old guys in the crowd. Including our FNG GoDaddy. Welcome!

## NMS

- Writing a proper backblast is important when you've got an FNG. That guy might want to see when it was that he first posted. Instead of having to guess, like me.
- Limited run doesn't have to mean limited suck. If you're going to a limited run workout to slack off, check yourself.
- Left Cheek enjoyed seeing YHC bearing down on HIM in the Crawl Bear position
- Fun watching guys help each other complete those pullups
- Speaking of - this is you vs you. Don't get caught up in the comparison game.
- MIAGD!
