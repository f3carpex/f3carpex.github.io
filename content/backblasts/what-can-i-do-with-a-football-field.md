Loved the fact that we have spring football! Wanted to leverage the amazing field and track at Flying Circus on this fine spring morning! 14 total gathered, here's the quick & dirty regarding what did happen....5:45 hits & we say the mission & pledge, begin mosey to the stadium.... but, whoops! SUV coming in on two wheels & everyone knows exactly who that is .... alter the plan to loop through the parking lot to give said HIM a chance to get out & join up. Continued mosey down to track, did a lap, then circled up for:

Warm-up: good morning, windmill, hillbilly, fazios/other shoulder stuff, planks, merkins, etc. Everybody up and moving to the football field goal line lined up facing West (that way for most PAX) for Thang #1:

Thang #1: now becoming famous modified Jack-Webbs: bearcrawl to the 10 yd line, 1 merkin, 40 alleluias. Bearcrawl to the 20 for 2 merkins & 36 alleluias. Continue the full 100 yards to finish with 10 merkins & 4 alleluias -- good thing we warmed up dem shoulders! Time for some leg work on:

Thang #2: partner up on the track. Partners split up and run opposite directions to meet on the other end - wherever you meet up for 3 partner burpees. Stop 1/2 to & fro for 5 LBCs. Repeat with 5 partner merkins, repeat with 5 partner monkey humpers (you say monkey, I say humpers). Let's add some core work for:

Thang #3: stick with the partner theme -- partner 1 runs up to the top of the steps & back while partner 2 planks. Repeat with alternating side planks, repeat with side plank star crunches. Sweet! time for one more thang:

Thang #4: run track to far endzone -- run the soccer lines -- goalie box & back, penalty box & back, midfield & back, then all you got the full field. Whew....

Get back up the stairs for Dying Cockroaches & Have a Nice Day! Right on time!
