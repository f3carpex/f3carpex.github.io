So I found out on Monday that 9/12 was National Day of Encouragement and that Chinese Downhill needing to switch so I had the Q! Must be God's providence.

Woke up to rain so plans changed a little.  8 guys started out and we headed up the Cary Parkway hill to the covered parking.

**Now for a little encouragement!** My favorite verse on exhortation is Hebrews 3:13.

"But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called “today,” that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin."

So after a warm up we did some Hebrew 3:13s  (3 exercises 13 reps) 13 dips, run, 13 merkins, run, 13 Australian merkins, run X 10

Guess who showed up on round 8? Term Paper! No penalty burpees bc I was just trying to complete the Hebrew 3:13s.

Next up: Partner Sprints. They are a great way to encourage people.  Down and back X 10. Rest during partners turn.

Run all the back to the rock pile for some Colt 45s.

Carry rock to the concrete balls.  Alternate 20 rocks rows to 20 irkins X 3

Finally we finished with Mary - Heels to Heaven, LSF, Dolly, Outlaws, and 6 inch hold.

Announcments, name o rama, and prayer requests.  I took us out in prayer.

Thanks for everyone coming out in the rain. I enjoyed it!

Hermes- next time let you know you aren't going to be there so I can get the flag :)
