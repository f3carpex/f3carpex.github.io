Three PAX for a Bruisers IR workout during Phoenix. The Phoenix PAX run off with Build-A-Bear, the Bruisers grab coupons and get to bruisin'.

**Warm-Up**

Circle up for imperial walkers and Sir Fazios, squats, hillbillies. Navin shows up a little late, but a little late is still late, so ten burpees OYO.

**The Thang**

Form two groups in front of the senior center, group 1 bear crawls to the entrance and back while group 2 does AMRAP curls, flapjack. Repeato with lunge walks and AMRAP overhead press.

Grab the coupons (20 lb dumb bell, 30 lb kettle bell, 25 lb kettle bell x 2) and travel to the pocket park on the other side of the senior center. Three rounds of irkins, dips and derkins, 20 reps, 15 reps and 10 reps.

With four PAX and four different coupons we'll rotate through so each PAX gets a round with each coupon.

Round 1 and 3 - overhead press and American hammers Round 2 and 4 - curls and Freddie Mercury with a press

YHC counted incorrectly, so ten burpees OYO.

Four rounds of overhead press, curls, rows and squats.

Trip around the pocket park, switching between bear crawls and lunge walks at each corner.

Four rounds of squats and LBCs.

YHC didn't appreciate all the back and forth between the various branches of our great military on Slack the previous day, we are all Team America, so ten burpees OYO.

Grab the coupons and travel back to the flag, various Mary exercises until the Phoenix PAX return.

**NMS**

YHC has a bad ankle, WWW has bad knees, Navin was saving his legs for a long run the next day, and Frisco was there just the entertain the rest of us.

I appreciate all the work that went into getting Bruisers rolling, it is a blessing for those who need a break from the running workouts, it allows us to continue posting in the gloom with our brothers.
