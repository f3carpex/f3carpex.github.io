A pair of NC State hoodies got out of their cars. Matching. Embarrassing.

It's 5:46, time to get going. SSH start. Frisco rolls up. Casually.

**Thang:**

Get a rock from the heavy rock pile. Non-travel.

Set of Curls, 20 yd lunge walk, Presses, 20 yd lunge walk, Squat, 20 yr lunge walk, Rock row, 20 yd lunge walk.

First time: 20. Second time: 15. Third time: 10.

Rocks apparently got heavier as time went on. Solid conversation was had. It was like a shield lock, I guess.

Return rocks.

**Mary**:

**COT**: 4.

Prayers and praises for marriages, addictions, COVID and family.

Beautiful time out this morning. Too bad we missed the lunar eclipse.
