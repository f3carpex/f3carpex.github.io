Forgetting to have picked the Q at last weeks Piranha Park's hard launch as per site tradition, the Q was chosen at the popup Stone Cutters AO this past Wednesday. YHC had about 3 days to plan what is only my 3rd Q for a 60-minute boot camp. Inspiration struck when I saw the Carpex Core Challenge for the day was an 18-exercise pyramid (thanks Prodigal).

## Warmups

Cloudy and 60 degrees. 9 Pax, no FNGs. Began with the pledge.

Mosey to basketball court and along the way:

- **SSHs**, 12 IC
- A sort of posterior swing like a kettleball, no F3 name so YHC proposed _Good yesterdays_ since they're a bit like a good morningn but stretching further behind. However, Site Q Earhart overruled this suggestion so henceforth we're calling them **Paul Bunyons**, 12 count.
- **Don Quixotes**, 12 count. Last week Theismann pointed out that windmills had an F3 name, so a quick dive in the exicon revealed this name. We did them much quicker than abaygos or however it's spelt.
- **Typewriters**, up and down the basketball court twice.
- Open Concept reminded us to **Pick up the trash** to leave the site better than whatever teenager 2nd F event had occurred last night.

Mosey towards the shelter and repeato back down the warmup exercises since this is a **Pyramid** workout.

Tablework at the Shelter

- **Derkins** 12 count
- **Dips** 14 count
- **Irkins** 16 count
- **Bulgarian squats** 10 count each leg

## Thang 1 - Crawls at the court

- **WMD crawl** to the far end of the court. 5 wide arms / 10 wide arm crawl, then 5 merkinss / 10 normal crawl, then 5 diamonds / 10 small arm crawl. The tennis courts are a heckuva lot longer than the picklecourts...also helps if you count left-right as one for the crawls.
- **Run** a lap
- **One-legged stiffleg deadlift**, 10 each side, getting in some knee PT for all our BRR trainers
- **Bonnie Blairs**, 10 IC
- **Squats**, 30 count
- **Bonnie Blairs**, 10 IC
- **One-legged stiffleg deadlift**, 10 each side
- **Run** a lap
- No time for another WMD crawl, but of course we did **Bear crawl bridge** on our way to the rock bridge

## Thang 2 - Upper body DORA

Grab a travelling rock and partner up.

Partner 1 – **Travel carry rock overhead** around the loop

Partner 2 – Work on the **DORA** exercises

- **Pullups**, 25 count
- **Tricep extensions**, 50 count
- **Goblet squats**, 75 count
- **Curls**, 100 count

Then swap, took about 2 laps.

No time to pyramid down the tablework at the shelter because we still needed to complete the...
