Prayer concerns Papa Smurf from ENC, who may only have about 6 months left

NMS I expected a small crowd with the launch of Kryptonite, but 17 of us wanted the extra 15 minutes of sleep and less miles. Thanks for all of the birthday wishes Franklin was calling for 56 GM and I was tempted 56 merkins was pretty tough Next time I call 21s, the running part needs to be a lot shorter. maybe the length of a tennis court. Its a long way up that hill The audible to only count even numbers led to confusion. If you do 14 plankjacks, do you do 6, 7 or 8 lbcs? Bartman called for the LBCs to add up to 21 and that made sense to me, but I didn't convey this well. Nature Boy mentioned that there was a basketball game tonight. I may have to record it, because 9:20 is way past this old man's bedtime The bear crawl/crawl bear curb merkins was pretty darn hard. I intend to try this again, but need to find curbs that are closer together (kind of like the 21s). I had a lot more planned, but my clock management was inferior this morning. Great work this morning Pet Sounds, I mean Angry Elf. Always an honor to lead
