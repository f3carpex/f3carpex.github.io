The Carpex challenge tour continues as YHC takes the Q at the premiere (only) Carpex Kettlebell workout! Admittedly, YHC is not typically a KB guy, but as previously stated, Carpex challenge. I have a friend that posts some KB workouts on the book of face so I was going to steal one of her workouts, until I tried to do the first set of exercises and realized my bell was too heavy and I would die if I attempted that. So now I'm shooting from the hip (as per usual). Thanks to the Pax for ideas as we were moseying to kill time. Anyway, here's what we did:

**Warmup**: 16 Pax at the flag with no FNGs so pledge stated and off we go for a mosey. Circle up in the parking lot for:  
SSH x 15 IC  
Good Mornings x 5 IC  
Sir Fazio Arm Circles x 10 IC  
Seal Claps x 10 IC  
Imperial Walkers x 10 IC  
Plank Jacks x 10 IC  
Calf Stretch L/R x 10 silent count each side

**The Thangs:** Everyone grab a bell and head to the middle island in the parking lot. Split the group in half (for distancing purposes). Starting at the island move ahead one space and complete Bicep curl (L/R), Row (L/R), and KB swing. Continue moving forward a parking space increasing by 1 rep each time (reaching 9 total). Head back to the start carrying the bell over your head. Mosey around the pickle and return to you bell.  
Round 2: Same ladder as before, but exercises are KB merkin, figure 8, chest press from squat. Lunge walk back to the start. Mosey.  
Round 3: Squat, 2 hand curl, tricep extension. Back to the start. Mosey.

**Mary:** Grab your bell and circle up. On your 6 for:  
KB LBCs x 15 IC  
KB American Hammers x 15 IC  
Hello Dolly x 15 IC  
Have a nice day.

TCP Sawgrass event 11/1. Mulching, spray beds, trim hedges, etc. Looking for 30 volunteers.  
Prayers for Water Wings and Coxswain's brother as he continues to recover from his broken ankle.
