Wednesday, plenty of options to ensure the sun is fully blotted. YHC on the QIC at SNS. Let's go!

Warm-up:

- Over to the community center lot via butt kicks, high knees and karaoke
- Circle up for GM, SSH, SFAC + seal claps, merkins
- Quick feet + curb merkins at 10, 15, 20

The Thang-a-lang:

- Get a partner and 1 rock per group
- Flip-flop running the pickle whilst 1 partner amraps curls, triceps, press and rows
- Introduce the **Apolo Anton Oh NOOOOOO!** into the rotation: It's a speed skater movement with the rock going side to side. We did that three times per partner
- Put the rocks back and move the pax over to the pocket park for a series of LRSU, incline merkins, dips and derkins. Three rounds through, I believe.
- Move the pax back to the main lot for a round of Mary with pax leading.

COT: 47 in total today across the Bon Park offerings; Insomnia (tclaps to the lone ranger, Callie), Vespers, Maynard and SNS. Hi-Liter took us out.

NMS: Welcome FNG Snake Eyes, YHC's summer intern at the 9-5. He doesn't seem any worse for wear in the office today, so I think we did ok.
