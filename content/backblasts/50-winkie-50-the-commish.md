Lastly, this was my 6th Q of the month marking a PR. Really never saw that coming, as I Q’d two times last year in total.  I mention this as I am taking to heart the blessing that I have found within the brotherhood of F3.  The support and encouragement has been great.  I appreciate each and every one of you.  

YHC took us out in prayer. 

Cold beers were had courtesy of One-Four.
