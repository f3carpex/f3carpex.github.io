It's BRR Season, and that means hills and excessive (debatable) running at most AO's, especially if you're not on a BRR team. Today was no exception, and 13 studs posted at the earliest AO in all of Carpex this warm, muggy morning, several of whom just ran the Maynard the day before. I remember when Recovery-sacking was customary after a Maynard. Those good 'ole days were just last year!

I wanted to ensure I was prepared, so in the event a pax or two were just adamantly opposed to doing the BRR Prep workout, I had something special for them, though I advised against it. No fear, it'll show up again anyway.....

At 5:15 we departed the lot and did a quick warmup:

- 20 SSH
- 10 IW
- 10 GM's
- Calf stretch with 10 Mericans and switcheroo

That's enough warming up..... Let's go to the bottom of the hill on Ederlee.

Per the Lexicon, "Triple Nickel" is: Find a hill. Start at bottom, run to top and complete 5xcalled exercise, run to bottom and complete 5xcalled exercise, 5 repetitions (5/5/5=Triple Nickel). Can easily be done on flat surface with launch point and target point.

We did 5 Burpees at the bottom and 5 Worst Mericans Ever at the top, 5 times. BUt wait, whats this, we still have time??! What to do?! Well, we took advantage of that and did the Ave of the States Hill once as well!

Back to the flag collecting our shirts along the way and circled up for 20 Tempo Mtn Climbers.
