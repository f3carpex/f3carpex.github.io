**Warm-Up** Mosey around the school to the bus lot and circle up for imperial walkers, arm circles, mountain climbers, good mornings and burpees (only because it was chilly, the pax had been on their good behavior so far).

**The Thang** Mosey over to the basketball court and circle up for Birthday Surprise. Schroeder did this at our Bruisers workout this weekend and I liked it so much I stolt it. One man selects an exercise, then the man to his left calls that exercise with the number of reps matching the day of his birthdate. Maybe you get one rep, maybe you get thirty-one reps, maybe he's a Leap Year baby and you get thirty-two. Various exercises were called, but the one that stood out was the Side Spank Starbursts (I think that's what Hi-Liter calls them).

Mosey down to the parking lot for the Number of the Beast, six reps of six exercises at six different locations. Various exercises were called, but the one that stood out was the Star Wars Crunches (I think that's what Hi-Liter calls them).

Time's running out so we close with another round of Birthday Surprise. Various exercises were called, but the one that stood out was the Star Trek Starbucks (I think that's what Hi-Liter calls them).

**Mary** Circle up at the flag for one quick round of dying cock-a-roaches and we're done.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  7 **Name-a-rama**:  2 RESPECT, 5 meh, 0 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for One Direction and his M as the near the end of the process of becoming foster parents, prayers for Saban's FIL and the rest of his family. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**  This is an awesome site! I remember Rooney talking about it before it launched, and it's even better than expected. It's a stretch for some of us to get out here, but make the effort sometime, it's worth it.

During warm-ups YHC called imperial walkers, and everyone did imperial walkers, except Pet Sounds, the one guy who drove in from Apex, who did hillbillies. I guess you can take the boy out of hillbilly town, but you can't take the hillbilly town out of the boy.

During the second round of Birthday Surprise, Beaker accurately remembered everyone's number. So if you're going to Vegas and need a card counting partner, he's your guy.

Four for coffeeteria at Sweetwaters afterwards, YHC, PS, 1D and Porch.

Love you guys!
