I will admit that prior to 2021 I had only been to one workout at Cornerstone (aka the Artist formerly known as Sovereign Grace.)  But now that I know this place has battle ropes and tires I am definitely coming back.  That is the kind of stuff that was fun back when I knew what the inside of a gym looked like.     

7 other guys roll in on a beautiful morning.  Chipper is tapering, so I am doing my dead level best not to move anywhere.  We all turn where we stand to do the Pledge.  Since we are generally in a circle, we also just stay put for the warm up:

- 5 Good mornings OMD
- 20 SSH IC
- 15 IW IC
- 15 Sir Fazio IC
- 15 Fazio Sir IC

The workout isn't hard to explain.  8 exercises for 8 people as we move through the stations for three complete circuits:

- Tire Flip (the timer for each individual exercise round)
- Battle Rope
- Kettle Bell Tricep Extensions
- Coupon Curls
- Kettle Bell Goblet Squats
- Overhead Ball Slams
- Kettle Bell Swings
- Kettle Bell Merkins

Not a lot of funny things to recount here.  Just eight guys doing some work.

No time for a fourth round, so we move approximately 12 feet to circle up for Mary, with all 8 calling an exercise. Stay tuned for details on the upcoming Stations of the Cross workout.  Prayers for job seekers and those affected by the pandemic.  YHC took us out.
