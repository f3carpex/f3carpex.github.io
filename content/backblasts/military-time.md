28 strong for a #TeamFOD Q this morning.  YHC has now become used to 0530 (and soon to be 0515) workouts that upon arrival there was _plenty_ of time to stretch.

Pax started rolling in but, of course, none made an entrance like Burt...yes Burt was at FOD.  I think for the first time since we tried to throw Callahan a surprise baby shower, so like what, 2-3 years ago!?  Anyways he came in windows down mumblin his chatter BEFORE HE EVEN PARKED HIS CAR!  Impressive.

0545 _finally_ struck, YHC gave the disclaimer and we were off.  Pax one way, Franklin the other.

**Warm Up:** Signature Shut-In except replaced 20 merkins with 20 arm circles...you'll find out why shortly.

## The Thang

- Introduced some Pax to the Paula Abdul - two steps forward one step back - using light poles.  Run up two lights, back one, then to keep it thematic do 10 JLo's - repeato until you reach the top of the hill.
- Once at the top we ran down into the upper soccer field for the following

**Merkin Clock...military time!** Partner up.  Between you and your partner you will peform a merkin clock starting at 1 o'clock and ending at 2400hr.  So 1 merkin, 2 merkins, 3 merkins, etc.  P2 will run from fence to fence and then flapjack with you.  Go until you're "out of time" - got that from Nature Boy! 2400hr on a merkin clock = 300 merkins, btw.

**Wall Challenge** Next all P1s go head to head with all P2

- P1 does a one-legged people's chair, no changing feet, no resting.  When you can't hold it anymore you're out.  Off the wall.  Go do mary and wait.
- P2 is running a short loop outside the fence and when they return however many men are still standing they do that many Star Jumps.
- Then they run again, see how many guys are left, do star jumps...on repeat until there are no more guys on the wall.
- Then P1s and 2s flapjack and do it again.
- Then we do another set of rounds with BTTW and Burpees!
- Then we were supposed to do the other leg people's chair but ran out of time.  So we all got on the wall and 10 counted down the line.

Then we were 2 mins from time so we hustled back, circled up, and counted and did names and all that fun stuff!
