A FWD workout that doesn't involve running to the bridge or some other far away place. They said it couldn't be done. And yet providence found a way.

**Warm up:**

- 10x - GM's IC
- 10x - Windmills IC
- 10x - IW IC
- 10x - MC's IC
- 10x - Murcans SC

**The Thang:**

Run out of the park on the sidewalk and then cut back through the woods to arrive at the basketball court. A little obfuscation to confuse the Pax and assert Q dominance. That totally worked right?Â  Anyways the folks are out of town and it's time to plan a raging house party! From the end of the basketball court line up and invite the following pal's over.

- Bear Crawls
- Crab walks
- Bunny Hops
- Frog Jumps
- Inch Worms
- Gorilla Hops

Well that was lit. Now errbody got to leave before the parentals get back.

- Crawl Bears
- Walking Crabs
- Hopping Bunny's
- Jumping Frogs (this was a lil tough)
- Worms Inching
- Hopping Gorillas

Like some guys I tend to put the cart before the horse. We should have taken care of the Balls area first before the party. Oh well. Time to go handle 'em for the next time.

Partner up for Dora 1,2,3. P1 will do called exercise whilst P2 is weaving the Balls until the set number of reps is achieved. Amrap Ball Weaving by both partners until all Pax are done.

- 100x Plank Jacks SC
- 200x SSH SC
- 300x Quick Feet LR=1

We were having too much fun with the balls to leave them just yet however. All Pax grab a Momma Rock. That's not quite a Daddy rock but it ain't no Baby rock either. P1 will bear crawl/lunge walk through the balls(without the rock) whilst P2 does amrap of the called exercise and then flip flop. Both Partners amrap the called exercise until all Pax are done.

- Rock Curls
- Rock Triceps Extension
- Rock Shoulder Press (Callahan for some reason unbeknownst to YHC decided to swap Hermes rock with a much heavier one. Shenanigans.)
- Rock Trunk Twist

With time on the clock we return the rocks and head towards the picnic tables. "Um, the flag is the other way." "Yeah it is!"

Time left for...

- 20 x URCANS, DURCANS & DIPS SC

**Mary:**

- 30x LBC's IC
