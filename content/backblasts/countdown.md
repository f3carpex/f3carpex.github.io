In the interest of full disclosure I have to admit that I had totally forgotten that I signed up to Q A-Team. Originally I had this planned for my rest day of the 1-Year Anniversary Q Week, but guess I signed up at some point so who needs rest days anyway. So in coming up for a workout I thought of some of the good ones I've been to at A-Team over the last year and realized they were a lot of different spots so why not try to tour the whole area.

Thunderstorms had passed us by so everyone is rolling in. There is an FNG so I have to decide if I want to give him my mangled mixed up version of the mission or display my amazing delegation abilities by pawning it off on Yogi. After Yogi gives the mission (funny it was a lot longer then Burt's version) we did the pledge and were off.

**Warmup**:

Mosey to the parking lot for

SSH x 20, Sir Fazios x 10, Seal Claps x 10, Fazio Sirs x 10, Merkins and Good Mornings (Crimson approved).

**THE THANG**

So in the same parking lot we started with 7's, Merkins on one side of the pickle and Burpees on the other end.

After that we took a nice brisk run to the hill. Since I was nice, instead of 7s we did 6s with StarJumps at the top of the hill and Squats at the bottom. Somehow I think Hotspot runs faster uphill.

Next we ran over to the pavilion. Being even nicer I only made it 5s this time (I think you can see where this is going). With step ups on one end and some select your own rock curls for girls on the other end.

Finally took the road going back and hit the next hill this time with abbreviated 3s, Dips at the bottom and burpees at the top.

Then hauled back to the flag to narrowly avoid going over on time.

**COT**

My fitbit had us a 3.2miles for the morning, so I think we got a good tour in. Time to name an FNG, so Mr. Buck was from PA, a Steelers fan and some good names were suggested but once Term Paper had said Uncle Buck nothing else could even really come close.

MIAGD!
