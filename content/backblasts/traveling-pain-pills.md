**AO: Phoenix**

Twelve HIMs gathered this morning for some fun at Phoenix. Welcome brother Chum, who joined us from F3 Chapel Hill area. Here's what we did.

**Warm-up:** Mosey to the upper lot, circle up for Good Mornings, Side Straddle Hops, Windmills... _on cue, Callahan arrives late, again_. Continue with Sir Fazio's forward, Seal Claps, Overhead Claps, Sir Fazio's reverse. Five penalty Burpees (thank you, Callahan). Finish up with Merkins and Mountain Climbers. Recover. Select a pain pill (CMU) from the truck and Mosey to the boathouse.

**Thang 1:** Partner up for a Dora with 100 Dips, 200 Merkins, 300 LBC's, trade off running the pickle with a pain pill. Recover

**Thang 2:** Mosey with the pain pills to the amphitheater. In partners, first round partner 1 on stage does Kettle Bell Swings, partner 2 does Crawl Bear, Bear Crawl, Crawl Bear, Bear Crawl up and down the aisles. Switch. Round 2 is Lunge Walk and Rock Rows. Round 3 is Prisoner Run and Curls. Recover

**Thang 3:** Mosey with the pain pills to the Kiosk for Sevens starting with 6 Pulsing Squats at the bottom (teabag the pain pill three count, jump up on the fourth count = 1), run up the hill for a Burpee, repeato for Sevens.

Mosey with the pills back to the lot, drop 'em in the truck, run to the flag for a quick Have a Nice Day.
