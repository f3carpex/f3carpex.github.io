It was a good day at the Green Mile. You'd never have guessed that we were recovering from school-closing-level inclement weather that terrorized Wake County just one day ago. Eight HIM avoided the well-advertised long run to Durham and worked their whole body while tooling around Cary. The beat-down began as the just-setting full moon lit up the night.

We warmed up thoroughly after the weather had dropped about 30 degrees over the last 24 hours: plyo-jumps for length and height complemented karaoke, butt kickers, and high knees during three loops around the track. A comprehensive stretching warm-up followed.

Thang 1:  
Three times around a four-corners circuit: **squats; anvils; pommel-horses; Sir Fazios**.

Bear Chase run down to the cinderblocks; grab a cinderblock and two team tires.

Thang 2:  
Partner up for alternating **rock-your-body** or **manmakers** and **tire flips**.

Bear Chase to the greenway entrance.

Thang 3:  
Deconstructed hill repeats, with **plank**, **LBC**, and **superman** between each interval.

Bear Chase to the track.

Thang 4:  
Partner up for **relay suicide sprints**.

Cool-down lap brings us to the almost-sunrise for **Sun Salutations**.

Mosey back to the flag for a bit of Mary, more stretching and a strong COT. MIAGD, gentlemen.
