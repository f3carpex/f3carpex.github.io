Is there a better Tuesday morning activity? I think not. Wake up, stretch, say good morning to your homies, and get that party started. Yeah baby. Let's get snakebit.

If you haven't been to FWD lately, my oh my how things of changed. They're even slanging dranks out there. Burt with that Bud Light Seltzer even. YHC had no idea. It's the perfect place to play through to, if you catch my drift.

Alas, there had to be some exercising. Wobbly out the gate thanks to that new FWD feeling, we started with a nice little walk to catch our balance. Shaking the cobwebs loose, it was time to feel our feet leave the ground. Floating on that buzz, we worked on getting high. More than once. Then YHC puff puff passed to his homie Smokey, who took the party to a whole new level, pulling out those rocks. Woo! From there, the party was lit! Once the rocks were done, it was time chill out and throw a few back.

Now that, my dear reader, is how you do a Tuesday.

Now just don't get fired on your day off, right Smokey? YHC out.

Postscript: Big ups to Momento, who posted for his first time in SIX YEARS. Fresh off a move south from F3 Raleigh, be on the lookout for our new boy.
