37 shakers and vesperers came in to the gloom on special day across F3 Nation, a day where we set aside some time during COT to talk about mental health. But first we have to squeeze 45 minutes of pain into 35 minutes. To help us out, and to illustrate a point, we're taking one of the Rolling Stone coupons with us, a solid, sturdy log, large and heavy enough that it requires two PAX to carry it. We'll pass it around so everyone gets a chance to carry it, but if ask for help, you'll get it, and if someone offers to help, you accept it.

**Warm-Up** Mosey over to the community center parking lot and circle up for side straddle hops, imperial walkers, cotton pickers and Sir Fazios.

**The Thang** Partner with someone with a similar sized ego and mosey to the rock pile behind the community center and grab one ego rock per pair.

Some PAX are dragging their feet, so drop your rocks for 10 burpees OYO.

Group 1 does BTTW while group 2 executes 20 curls, then flapjack. Repeato with overhead presses, rock rows and squats. Some PAX modified BTTW and did Australian mountain climbers. Finish up with a round of people's chair and 10 rock your bodies.

Put the rocks back and mosey to the end of the parking lot for copperhead squats, continue to the bottom of Kiosk Hill for copperhead merkins.

With time running out we'll modify 11's. 11 jump squats at the top of the hill, 11 merkins at the bottom, decrease reps by one each round, we can get a few rounds in.

Mosey to the Billy Run Line, AYG to the flag.

**Mary** 100's, dying cock-a-roaches, box cutters, Have A Nice Day.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  37 **Name-a-rama**:  RESPECT, meh, HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for the men in our region and across the nation, that we can seek help when we need it, that we can provide help when our brothers reach out to us. **BOM**:  Chinese Downhill, Smokey and others shared experiences dealing with mental illness, YHC took us out.

**NMS**

What a great morning to be in the gloom. Thanks to Chinese Downhill and Smokey for their leadership every day, but especially today. Two High Impact Men with a wealth of knowledge and experience, and a willingness to share it with others. If you are hurting, reach out to either one of them, they will listen to you and they will help you.

Thanks to Bartman for providing the log.

Thanks to Squatter for leading 100's while YHC grabbed the phone. I can remember a lot of names, but 37 is outside my range.

Have you guys noticed how fast Smokey has gotten since he started getting six packs every week.

We were gonna do those burpees anyway.

As always it's an honor to lead this group of High Impact Men.
