At 0545 a quick check for FNGs came up empty, which was a bummer because I had absolutely memorized the F3 mission statement. Instead I just let all of the veterans know that I really had no idea what I was doing and they should modify accordingly. On to the Pledge.

Warmup: Mosey to the top parking lot to the right and circle up for

- 20 SSH IC
- 10 GM IC
- 10 Standard Merkins OMD
- Calf Stretches L/R
- 10 Wide Grip Merkins OMD
- 10 Daisy Pickers IC

Mosey to the back parking lot.

Thang One: Partner up for Dora - 100 Burpees, 200 Merkins, 300 Squats, with a pickle run. Side Note - In hindsight this ended up being pretty terrible.  Appreciate the fact that no one mutinied.

Thang Two: Mosey back towards the front of the park and stop at the foot of the main hill.  I originally had a grand vision for 7s at this spot, but alas there wasn't enough time.  Instead we audibled into hill runs with 10 guardrail dips at the bottom and 10 straight leg raises at the top on repeat until time expired.  

Mosey back to the front with carioca mixed in along the way.

A final Mary with 20 LBCs IC, 20 Low Slow Flutters IC and 5 more Burpees OYO.

COR - 21 / NOR - 6 Respects

Announcements:

- 9/11 Stair Climb
- 10/5 Charity Golf Tournament and Beer Drinking (Contact 16 Steves or Hamm for details)

Prayers and Praises:

- Praises for all of the guys who successfully ran the BRR last weekend
- Prayers for two upcoming surgeries affecting relatives of Pax
- Prayers for continued healing of injuries

At this point Hello Kitty randomly wandered out of the forest just in time to join us for the prayer.  YHC took us out.

NMS: It was an honor to be able to lead at A-Team this morning.  This was the first AO I ever posted to in Carpex, so I am very glad I was able to make my VQ here.
