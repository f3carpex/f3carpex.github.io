EC: ran down the street to a geocache I had driven to a few times previously but which was always surrounded by people waiting for the dermatologist to open or let them in or whatever. Thankfully the parking lot was empty at a quarter past 5. Logged my cache and ran back, taking a slight detour to inspect the site.

Five PAX gathered, including two guys I had not met before. Introduced myself to Zamboni and Backache (rhymes with Pancake). Although they've been coming for the last several weeks, this will be their first BB. For shame!

**Warm-up:**

No site Qs... no flag. School is not in session so we need to find a flag elsewhere. Let's mosey. Luckily just a few hundred yards south of the school a fine citizen has a big flag pole (unlit) with a flag on it. Pledge was said. Mosey continued to a parking lot for GMs and other stuff. Even some stretches. 44 or 45 merkins were done as well.

Mosey back to the flag.

**Thang:**

There was no theme. Just a collection of thangs. Mary inspired LBCs and oblique crunches on the soft rubbery playground surface (a la Measure Twice). Some Diamond work including BTTW / People's Chair / Squats while we took turns rounding the bases. Outfield sprints a la Mays. Back to the playground for pull-ups and dips while the PAX take turns running the pickle. Back to the flag.

**Mary:**

Some Agility City and Quick Feet followed by Cockroaches, J. Lo's, Putins and Sarkozy's, Low-slooooow-flutters and supermans.

**COT:**

5

Announced the Juneteenth Raleigh events, TCP, WCC food drive

Prayers for the world ... and YHCs upcoming canoing trip.

**NMS:**

Good to meet the new guys down South. Looking forward to them jumping into Slack and into the Q game.
