Congrats to the 36 that participated in this year’s challenge. In the end, very few completed all 3 Fs, and in fact, not many were able to post at every AO in 2018. Perhaps I made it too difficult this year, or maybe I didn’t do a good enough job marketing the challenge. But I think it’s more likely a statement of our growth. In the end, it was successful, because I know that it made some number of PAX push themselves a bit more and get out of their comfort zone.

The time has come to pass the torch, so Disco Duck, Squatter and The Joker will be your Q’s in 2019. I am sure that they will come up with some new ideas to challenge all of you this year. I urge everyone who posts regularly to sign up, even if you know you won’t be able to complete it. Set your own personal goals, like trying a new AO each month or EH’ing 3 FNGS.
