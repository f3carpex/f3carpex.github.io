What does one do when they aren't familiar with the area and yet have signed up to Q for? Use Google Maps of course! So many trails and well lit sidewalks in the area... probably already been done... honestly all I could see were the rows and rows of houses neatly tucked around cul de sacs. And not small houses either, the kind of houses that probably wouldn't take lightly 20 hooligans dressed in mostly black and encroaching on their homestead. That's ok, we can be quiet... Oh hey, Burts here!

Warm up... gotta go quick to meet the expectations for a Krypto Q. We do some SSH's, Calf Stretches and merkins. Burt enforces the newly placed edict that we all count out loud. I announce my plan to take a tour of neighborhood cul de sacs and the first PAX gets to call what exercise we do. There is mumbling of "Two Factor just outsourced his entire Q..." and we're off! A couple of circles in front of Dude Solutions... no problem... Then we head down Regency and unleash chaos on OpenDoor threads and Ring Doorbells throughout the hood. By my calculations we had about 60 seconds in each court to finish the loop in time and to disappear before waking anyone up. Things are going smoothly short of a few Hermes "CAR!" warnings!

At this point everyone thinks we're lost. Local guide Hermes mentions that we could swing by his house which leads to a round of monkey humpers in front of Case de Hermes and the realization that we are quite far from the shovel flag. We book it back to the flag with just enough time to be 2-3 minutes late. Flustered from the run, we welcome FNG RayJay and cobble COT together. 4.3 miles in the books it was fun running with you all! Trunk coffee was on point as always!
