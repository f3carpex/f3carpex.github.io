94 degrees at game time.  True HIMs battle through, and so after pledging allegiance 9 math-letes braved the streets of downtown Cary for a number-themed extravaganza.

Mosey to the circle for...

**Warmup**

SSHs, Sir Fazio, Cotton Pickers, Imperial Walkers, Plank Jacks, Merkins on my down AND up, and a few burpees cause I hear it's a good stretch.

**Thang 1**

Double Nickel down the street.  Alternating 5 Monkey Humpers at one light pole, 5 burpees at the next.  Get to the end of the street and continue mosey over the elementary school.

**Thang 2.0**

7s on the sidewalk, Star Jumps and Dying Cock-a-roaches.  Once complete, mosey back toward the flag.

**Thang 2.1**

Now is where things get interesting.  Pick a wall or bench, start with 5 wall-jump burpees.  Then 4, and count it down to one.

**Mary**

PAX choice of Mary exercises.  Including Homer to Marge, cause BB run club.  Mosey to the fountain to take a foot bath.

**COT**

- 8 Mehs, 1 Respect
- Announcements: 5 year Carpex anniversary convergence, also need to get in your order for 9/11 stair climb shirts
- Praises/Prayers: Disco's M, Captain's mom, Lee Adkins diagnosis of stage 4 cancer, Robbie Helbert's double lung transplant recovery, all the kids going back to school and their teachers.  And of course McCants.
- Hello Kitty took us out.

**NMS**

- Burpee count today was 75
- There was a lot of complaining about the heat.  I don't control the weather boys.
- Saban didn't remind me how long it takes to get back to the flag. Not a single time.
- Jordan Lake Brewing Company is a little hidden gem.  Check it out.
- T-claps to Disco Duck for continuing to keep Rush Hour going.  Its a lot of fun, so check it out if you haven't.  I love running up to the circle and doing warmups to show off.  The PAX strategically positioned themselves during Monkey Humpers to let their best side show.
- T-claps to the newer guys like Navin.  Stay after it.
- Be a little better today than you were yesterday.  It was a pleasure to lead this fine group.
