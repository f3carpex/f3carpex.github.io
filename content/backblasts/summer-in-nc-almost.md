It has been almost 3 months, since my last Q at Rush Hour. Since starting in November 2019, I've not experienced summer workouts yet. As they say, it's not the heat, but the humidity. I propose that workouts done when the "Feels like" temperature is over 90 degrees, count as two. At the end of Rush Hour, 87 degrees feels like 94. It is nice to be back.

NMS: Captain Kirk walked to Claymore this morning and was a beast at Rush Hour. His mumblechatter, as usual, covered a wide range of topics. Water breaks and rest stops were incorporated throughout the workout. Well deserved and needed. It was great to be back out.
