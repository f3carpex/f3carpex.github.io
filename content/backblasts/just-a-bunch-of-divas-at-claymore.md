32 days between posts built a lot of pressure up to make my VQ legit. I'm biting off Qs every day for the next week and wanted to start it off the right way. I would be lying if I said I wasn't excited to get back to work with the boys (insert TOP GUN volleyball scene gif "here"). All I could hope for today were motivated HIMs, great weather, no car trouble, and some exhausted looks at the end of the workout...of those wishes, at least I got some beautiful foggy/muggy weather to work with! JK, the HIMs showed up, and I didn't hear much mumble chatter, so either they were being polite for my VQ, they didn't have breath to spare, and/or Frisco wasn't there.

I actually had plenty of time think about my workout while in Cali. I wanted to try a few things out that I'd been tossing around during other posts at Claymore, for this post I decided to leverage those long rows of cement parking chocks. I also wanted to spice things up with a rock solid playlist (don't listen to Pickles' and Press On's opinions, they just don't appreciate the hardships that Britney's had in her life) and to introduce a few cuties in the mix. Today was leg day, so I'm thinking you'll notice who posted today @ Claymore when they're at other posts this week.

3 Finger Salute saved the day when he showed up (late), because I needed multiples of 3 and he was #6! For this courtesy, I forgave him the tardiness...for I am benevolent.

On to the workout:

**Tuesday - 1 Sept - Claymore - LEGS**

**0545 - Welcome** - FNG disclaimer (no FNGs)

0546 - Pledge (no flag, no pledge...thanks Frisco)

**0547 - Mosey the long way around to long Parking lot**

**0550 - Circle time**

- Long good morning
- 25 x SSH
- 10 x burpees
- 10 4-count side lunges
- Grab some fence, 20 Marilyn Monroe's (L/R =1) (these are like glute raises, but you look super cute doing them, hence honoring Marilyn's name)

**0600 - Thang 1: Dora et Trois (Dora plus Boots)**

What is this, you ask? Boots is an athletic and energetic monkey who is Dora's best friend. He performs a series of acrobatic flips, somersaults, and cartwheels, along the way to their destination. His lightweight also makes him easy to carry, even for Dora. Without guidance from Dora, Boots is quick to take his own, often dangerous or dead-ended, route. Dora often acts as the voice of reason.

**\*Basically, mix your groups of 3 up with different skill levels...this actually makes the whole workout more difficult for the more in-shape HIM\***

**3 phases**: Jigglers (toe taps along the length of parking chocks), lunges, rocket squats

- Group starts rocket squats OYO as individuals 1-by-1 start Jigglers down the row. Lunges on the way back to the group. Start rocket squats until your turn again.

Repeat for **4 rounds**...the 6 knocked out 30 merkins for good measure instead of finishing off the end of round 4. Mongoose made a friend in the middle of the Thang...Don't worry, they socially distanced. He then chopped down a tree or something back in the woods.

**0615 - Thang 2**

- Bear crawl back towards Quik Stop's quik stop
- 25 x SSH
- Squat hold to failure...there was a lot of failure here
- Bear crawl to where the flag should have been

**0620 - Mary**

- 20 4-count LBCs
- 30 WWII’s
- 20 4-count Homer to Marge
- 20 JLo’s

**0630 - Have a Nice Day**

COT - 6 PAX, 2 Respects, plenty of wet shirts (due to either the rainwater or sweat, I'm not sure)

Announcements - 10 year anniversary, something else about CSAUP I think...

**My forte is finding motivation and inspiration from the thoughts of great leaders, so I offered to share some words from a great leader from history, as will be a theme of mine as a Q:**

> “1. It ain’t as bad as you think. It will look better in the morning.
> 
> 2\. Get mad, then get over it.
> 
> 3\. Avoid having your ego so close to your position that when your position falls, your ego goes with it.
> 
> 4\. It can be done!
> 
> 5\. Be careful what you choose. You may get it.
> 
> 6\. Don’t let adverse facts stand in the way of a good decision.
> 
> 7\. You can’t make someone else’s choices. You shouldn’t let someone else make yours.
> 
> 8\. Check small things.
> 
> 9\. Share credit.
> 
> 10\. Remain calm. Be kind.
> 
> 11\. Have a vision. Be demanding.
> 
> 12\. Don’t take counsel of your fears or naysayers.
> 
> 13\. Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier.”

> **\- Gen. Colin Powell**

**Prayer/Praises** - None offered, none provided, Mongoose took us out with a great soliloquy of a prayer!

**NMS**: I was glad to bring a few ladies to the workout, even if they just Divas like Marilyn and JLo. I had fun drafting up this workout and look forward to doing more of it. It's a good outlet for creativity and leadership; a different kind of leadership than I'm used to with less hierarchy and still great quality men. I would say the most challenging piece is trying to ensure a balance for all skill and fitness levels, while also building a workout not dependent upon a certain number posting. Hopefully, I can build enough of a reputation as a Q that I get some HCs every time I'm on the Q Sheet!
