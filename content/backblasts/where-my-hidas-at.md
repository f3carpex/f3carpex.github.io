3 HIMs gathered in the moist and foggy gloom of A-team for a post-Super Bowl celebration of [The Eagles](https://eagles.com/).Â  There were some football references thrown in for good measure.

### Warm-up

- Quarter 1: 12 Merkins
- Quarter 2: 21 SSH
- Quarter 3: 22 IW
- Quarter 4: 19 Sir Fazios that, appropriately, went back and forth

Some running also took place

### Thang

Find a rock. Preferably not an under inflated one.

E: Elf on the Shelf x20 IC. Drop your rock.

A: Jog to the largest shelter for 10x GMs and 26 IC Alternative L/R steps

G: Greta 1-2-3 of burpees (100x), rock curls (200x) and rock rows (300x) with a lap around the pickle post-burpee

L: Lunges across the BB court (full disclosure, these were done last)

E: some more Elf on the Shelfs

S: Suicides on the basketball court with dips and step-ups

### COT:

- 1 Respect and 2 Mehs
- Announcements: don't have to hear about the KKC for ~8 months
- Prayers: @sabancarpex's 2.0 getting braces

### NMS:

- Where are the HIDAs at?? @brianjodice may want to hold off on those orders.
- Thankful for the camaraderie this morning. This was the smallest group for any F3 workout for any of us but glad to see that small numbers don't mean insignificant results.
- Glad the Patriots didn't win. The Exicon doesn't have very many "O" exercises and the "T"s are pretty lame too.
