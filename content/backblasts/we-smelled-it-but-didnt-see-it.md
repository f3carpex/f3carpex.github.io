YHC has missed the 9/11 Stair Climb the last couple of years due to injury, and I'm determined to be there this year, so when the Rush Hour Q was available, I grabbed it, knowing we'd be headed to the parking deck.

**Warm-Up** Mosey over to the bottom of the parking deck and circle up for cherry pickers, imperial walkers, Sir Fazios, copperhead merkins, copperhead squats and Good Afternoons. While two reluctant volunteers retrieve a couple of pain sticks the rest of the pax do LBCs.

**The Thang** The pax with the pain sticks are travelling up the stairs, back down, then handing them off to someone else. The rest of the pax run up to the top of the parking deck, ten merkins, run back down, ten merkins, repeato until everyone has made the trip with the pain sticks.

Low slow flutters while the pains sticks are returned.

Mosey back up the stairs to the parking deck, on the line for one legged Homer to Marge, left leg up. On my GO, jump up and run across the parking deck, All You Got to the middle, recovery mosey the rest of the way.

Back on the line for one legged Homer to Marge, right leg up. On my GO, stand up and follow me down the stairs and over to the big fountain in the Town Hall courtyard.

Ten derkins at the fountain, run up one set of stairs, down the other, ten dips, run back. Repeato, dropping the number of reps by one each trip.

**Mary** Mosey over to the shade of the pocket park for Mary, including American hammers, dying cock-a-roaches, Hello Dolly, and low slow Freddy Mercurys.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  10 **Name-a-rama**:  1 RESPECT, 7 meh, 2 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Praise for our South Wake brothers and the great job they're doing raising money for local organizations, prayers for our marriages, prayers for Skipper's job search **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS** A strong group of HIMs this evening, current and former site Q's (Kermit, Theismann, YHC), Rush Hour regulars (Skipper, Quiver, Traffic Cone), vets who haven't been out in a while (Earhart, Old Maid), and the Hollar Boys making their first evening trip to beautiful downtown Cary (Q-bert, Sooey).

That being said, we had to do a lot of burpees tonight. A lot. It's like those guys were just trying to get Angry Duck to come out.

Kermit and Theismann have done an excellent job with Carpex's Premier Evening AO, but YHC has one nit to pick. The stairwell, especially one particular level, smelled like vomit. Not like garbage, not like poop, exactly like vomit. Just saying, we didn't have this issue when Banjo and I were running things.

Two weight vests joined us tonight. Theismann wore one, the other was passed around between Earhart, Kermit and Old Maid.

We ran out of time before anyone could finish the derkins/stairs/dips thing, but Theismann was close. Did you hear about the vest? That dude is nails.

Sooey's 2.0 Q-bert made his first non-F3dads post. Can't wait to see him out again.

Feet-in-the-Fountain COT is still one of my favorite things about Carpex.

Two for EC pull-ups (Kermit, Theismann), one for EC run (Old Maid), five for 2nd F at Pharmacy (Earhart, Kermit, Old Maid, Skipper, YHC). If you haven't tried their jalepeno pimento cheese you're missing out.

I had a great time tonight guys, thanks for coming out, thanks for letting me lead.
