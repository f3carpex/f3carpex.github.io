Signed up to help out Wahoo when he posted on 1stF asking for a Q. I took the opportunity to lead.

Met up with the HIMs in the gloom and they were fired up to go. Went through all the F3 administravia (Mission, Core Values, Credo, and Pledge of Allegiance to Old Glory.

After the Pledge, I had the HIMs follow Wahoo for a mosey around the BIG pickle while I lead the walkers around the small pickle. We all met by the basketball court for some warm-up. GM and Bat Wings. No wasting time so we got on it.

**Thang 1**: HIMs got their KB of choice and we headed over to the picnic tables for a HIIT routine. 15 was the magic number.
