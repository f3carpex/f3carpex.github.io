It was November 2014 when YHC and Michelob first posted to Ateam. At our one year F3aversary in November 2015, then Site Q’s Denali and Grease Monkey handed off the shovel flag to us to man for the next 2.5 years. We supposed it was time to share the honor with some HIM who hadn’t had the opportunity to do so yet. McCants already had the Q for today, so YHC requested it from him under the guise of “I’m leaving town and wanted to Q before I leave” – He bought it :-)

 

13 HIM showed up at the front gate, no FNG’s, so YHC grabbed the flag and we took off toward the back. We stopped along the way and planted the flag (Or leaned it up against something, we need some rain!) for a mobile warmup.

PAX circled up at the top of the parking lot. In this workout, we advanced the flag through the park. The first person to the flag grabbed it and moved it to the next stopping point. YHC went into an all out sprint and grabbed it the first time, and nearly broke the thing. YHC is pretty sure Largemouth grabbed it all the other times.

**Announcements**

Michelob and I handed over the Flag to Theisman and Smokey. It’s been an honor to serve the F3 community, and an honor to be glommed in with Michelob. Being associated with him in any sentence that is fitness related is humbling!
