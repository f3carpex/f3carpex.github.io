Date: 3/26 QIC: WWW AO: Claymore PAX: Bo Jackson, **Dice,** **Ezekiel,** Leprechaun, **Pickles,** Skipper, **Press On, WWW**

The toughest part about wanting to Q every week is not being predictable. With that said, it’s fun combing through the Exicon to find some new workouts and exercises. There are so many choices to choose from and many ways to create a devilish routine. I got the though of creating a different workout. I found C2C (Corner to Corner) and BLIMPS. To create a new routine, I came up with C2C BOMBERS. Read on to get the gist of what happened at #ao-tues-claymore. I already had it in mind that it was not going to be a running workout but will provide the option to the PAX to run if they wanted to run.

F3 admin stuff + Pledge of Allegiance. SLOOOOOOOWWWWW mosey to the tennis courts.

**Circle up for warm-ups** GM, Abe Vigoda, calf stretch with CFMs, Sir Fazio (forward/reverse), seal clap, air presses, overhead claps.

Now that we are warmed up and stretched out, it was time for the thang.

**Thang 1** Corner 2 Corner in the tennis court. The tennis court is bigger than I had imagined it.

**B**urpees x10

**O**utlaws x 10 each rotation (6” leg lift and circle right for 10 and then left for 10)

**M**erkins x20

**B**oxcutters x15

**E**ven more burpees x5

**R**everse crunches x10

**S**uicides (lunge walk to line then backwards walk / run to start)

We had enough time to slow mosey back to flag for some Mary.

**Circle up for Mary:** Boat/canoe x10, Homer-to-marge x10 IC, 150, Have A Nice Day.

**Count-a-rama:** 8

**Name-o-rama:** 5 respects, 1 meh, 2 hates

**Announcements:** Sign-up for Prayer Vigil and for prayers if you have them. Information on Slack.

**Prayers / Praises:** Prayers for Dice’s friend Tom and WC who has been fighting cancer. Prayers for Dust Bowl who is working through some possible hernia issues. Prayers for Ausfarht, Crimson and Sooey. Crimson’s M, Susan, whose uncle just received diagnosis about cancer.

**BOM:** YHC led us out.

**NMS:**

For those of you who have not Q’d before and plan on it, peruse the exicon for some fun ideas to bring the heat.

It was fun creating the workout. What’s cool was there was no visible or verbal theme. It kept the PAX on their toes.

The one thing you will always know is common in my workouts is burpees. The reason they are in my workouts is because they are tough, tough, tough. But, if you do them often, you get stronger; therefore, you can do more.

It was great and a true blessing to have led you HIMs this morning. Thanks for being there for me.
