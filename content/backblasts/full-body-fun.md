My first time Qing SNS, knowing I had big shoes to fill. On day 3 of Qing my anniversary week, my legs are letting me know that it's been a solid week of work so far, and this one would be no help to the soreness. It's all good, we got to get these Pax working.

Pull into the lot a little early to set some rocks up, seeing a handful of cars meaning the Maynard guys have already depated. As time to go gets closer, full disclosure, I am getting a bit nervous, as the big shoes to fill and all. Haven't been this nervous since my first Q, but game face as the clock hit 0530.

Mission statement, pledge, and mosey to the rock pile by the dam.

SSHx20

Calf stretch x 10 count, 5 Merkins, switch legs, calf stretch, 5 Merkins. Grab a rock big enough to hug for 40 minutes.

The thang: Modified 10 rounds with Tyson. Exercises include squats, deadlifts, overhead press, curls for the gurls, and modified count rock-yo-bodys, for time.

Mary: LBCs, Cannonballs (HK called), Life (Prodigal called).

Announcements: 4 July normal business, 2 AOs open and a 3rd exploratory Apex Friendship

Prayers/Praises: Freydaddy and family. Kitty getting good news on the good work they do. Hotspot 2.0 proud parenting moment with pushing cheerleading.

NMS: Qing 3 in a row gets tough, as they have been all different, but every one has pushed me and the pax to new heights.

Great to see Globetrotter back in the Gloom, and always great to see Chinese Downhill. Liverpool back at it, with a few months of MC pent up ready to go. Was a great morning, surrounded by men of the HIGHEST impact.

MIAGD!
