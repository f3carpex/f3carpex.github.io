**It all sounded like a good idea, until we started doing it.**

**Warm up**

A quick mosey around the parking lot and onto the lower soccer field

- SSHs
- Sir Fazios – front and back
- Plank jacks
- Calf stretches – both sides
- Mountain climbers
- Ernie Davis Heisman’s

**The Thang**

Mosey to the middle of FOD’s long road and partner up for modified 7s or “14s”. Partner one up the hill for 12 LBCs; partner 2 down the hill for 2 WWIIs; reverse and meet in the middle for 10 partner merkins. Repeat until complete. There was a fair amount of complaining and anguish – particularly when making it up the hill. YHC also thought more than once that 14s up and down the hill was not a great idea. Nevertheless, all persevered and half the group completed the journey.

Calling an audible, we made our way down to the rockpile

- 25 curls for girls
- 25 triceps extensions
- 10 count rock holds – around the horn (thanks Franklin)
- 25 rock your bodies

**Mary**

American hammers, Homer-to-Marges, Good mornings…Have a nice day!

**Announcements**

Night train (this Saturday?)

**Prayers / Praises**

Prayers for Moped’s wife, Pigeon’s co-worker, Chinese Downhill’s brother, Nabisco; praise by Loom for Ramadan support

Hi-Liter took us out.
