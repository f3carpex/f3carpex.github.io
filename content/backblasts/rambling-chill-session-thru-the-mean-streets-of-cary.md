## **Naked Moleskin**

YHC had never had the opportunity to Q at Rush Hour and had only been there once prior.  Going in YHC’s knowledge was limited so to good ole google maps came into play for research.  Heck YHC had never even been to downtown Cary before BO a few months back!  So, why not Q? Is there any better way to learn more about an area than running around - nope.  YHC got to see the mean street of Cary.  YHC has quickly learned the nasty minivan rules the Cary roads - do not temp fate, minivan momas will not hesitate to take out monkey humping fools.  Couple honks to make a man feel like a man.  :)

45 minutes went by WAY too quickly with this PAX.  Great COT chatter!!

2nd F at BB following... YHC was excited to see Ma Bell roll by, but feelings were dashed as he kept rolling on... No, Ma was on a mission and BB was not in the cards... next time sir.
