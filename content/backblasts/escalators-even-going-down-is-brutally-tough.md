AO: FOD Date: 8/20/19 PAX: 5 Hole, Beaker, Brosef, Callahan, Clementine, The Departed, Deuce, Dirty Bomb, **Ezekiel,** **Geek Squad**, **Goose,** Katniss, **Kilmer,** **Liverpool, Ma Bell,** Spit-Shine, Swag, FNG Toothless, Trike, **WWW**

I goal for my Q’s is to ensure the workout is challenging but yet attainable. It took some time to think of what I want to do.  What I came up with is an escalator workout.  Read on to find out what was in store for the PAX.

We moseyed over to Soccer Field 1 parking lot to warm-up. GM, Abe Vigoda, Sir Fazio (F&B), Calf Stretch (l/r/c), last but not least in any sense of the work … Eskimo Merkins x12.  I did have plans to do Chumbaburpee but I had all those Catalina Wine Makers in mind, so I modified as needed because CWM are riddled with merkins.  Ma Bell may think otherwise because he is a Merkin Beast!

Mosey into Field 1 to the north goal line. QIC calls out the thang.

Thang: Escalator (3 exercises):  30-25-20-15-10-5.  I had a different plan but after doing this escalator, I was not disappointed.

Catalina Wine Makers, Steve Earls, WWII

It may not look like much when you read about it but when you have to execute … it was challenging nonetheless. I was spent when I got done.  The thang took us to 10 mins to end time.

Mosey back to flag for a little Mary. QIC directs the PAX to circle up and get on their six for 150’s.  We had enough time to stretch before closing out the workout.  This is something I am trying to ensure I do at every workout.

Welcome FNG Toothless!

6-Man (Beaker) – gets out into the gloom because of the brotherhood.  He enjoys working out with the F3 Brothers rather than hitting the gym solo.

Beaker has a new meaning to my name WWW.  I’m honored.  I just like to bring a good workout routine to my Q’s.

F3 and my Carpex Brothers are true blessings in my life.

It is amazing how powerful it is when a group of your Brothers gather around and support a Brother in need (i.e. Capt Kirk, Liverpool and Cynthia, Chinese Downhill, etc.) … TRUE HIMs!!!
