So for my second Q YHC decide to Q at the place I posted for the Second time, and place that has become a favorite of mine Bradfords Ordinary As we waited for pax to arrive a few comments were made about the sweatshirt I was wearing and lack of tank top. I did wear the tanktop and shed the coat, Loom put the tank top over his F3 shirt prompting Burt to say we had 99% percent participation in TTT.

No FNG's, start to mosey, remember I wanted to do the pledge... apparently, I was not fully awake and apparently need a winkie for the pledge.  Pledge over off we go on a mosey to the bank.
