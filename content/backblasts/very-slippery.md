20 great men got up and came out to SWW. We did a slow jog around parking lot to a warm up, standard 23 Merkins for Gibson, 10 Windmills and 10 PlankJacks. We ran over to Hill on Kildare, we did 5 Carolina Dry Docks on every other light pole. Then we did some hill sprints and some LBC's, back to picnic shelter for some Frey Daddy Speed Racers. We did 15 dips followed by 1 lap, then 2 and finished with 3 laps.

 

COT, I shared my experience going to a AA meeting in NJ to support a friend, the principles are very impactful.

Liverpool shared being in a Hotel this week where he learned about Hunter, Grease Monkey's mom and Grandfather falling, my aunt Anne's Funeral tomorrow.

 

So blessed to have F3 in my life and Love you men.
