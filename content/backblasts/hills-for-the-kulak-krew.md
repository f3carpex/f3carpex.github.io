Wow – beautiful morning at the ole Danger Zone – crisp & cool with beautiful stars and a sliver of a moon.  My man Flacco had the Q, but asked me to step in as he is under the weather – “my pleasure” as they say at Chick-fil-a – hope you feel better quickly!  The PAX gathered with the site Q expertly giving parking commands – Klown Kar of Kulaks was a most welcome sight!  Pelican Brief & Push It in town for Liverpool’s big 5-0! 

With the faces of the PAX looking clearly disappointed to see a substitute teacher instead of a creative Flacco performance, here’s what went down:

Gather up at the flag, no FNG, start with the pledge…..

The Warm-up:

Mosey around the pickle, out of the park to the mini-office park – warm ups on the concrete pad:

Good mornings, windmill (got it this time Pivot), SSH, calf stretch with merkins, mountain climbers….

On that concrete pad we did one Turkish get-up then ran down to the bottom of the hill around the circle to do one burpee – demonstration of what comes next was complete.

The Thang!

Classic 7’s – starting with one burpee at the bottom, run up hill for the Turkish get-ups, etc. etc. – that hill is for real indeed.  Men worked hard for sure.  Plank holds & squat holds as we gathered up.  Mosey back to the DZ where we painted the lines in honor of Flip-Flop’s agility and did the famous Racoon Crawl wall.  Descending sets of dips & irkins were enjoyed by all.

Billy-run to the flag, circle up for Mary – LBC’s, WWII’s, Homer-to-Marge, have a nice day! Rumors are all false, nothing resembling Jane Fonda happened.
