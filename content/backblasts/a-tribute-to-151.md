151 on a Friday, not nearly that many at Phoenix the next morning, but still a chance to pay tribute.

1 FNG in the lot, a dang purrfect disclaimer and mission statement and it's time to workout.

Down to the lower lot. YHC encourages the young Mr. Miyagi to jump in a VQ a few warmup exercises. The kid did good, still much to learn, but he's on the right path.

Warm-ups included: GM, SSH, Arm Circle and seal claps and a round of quick feet and curb merkins at 5, 10, 15, 10, 5

Partner up in the lot for a modified Dora.

- 151 combined merkins, squats and LBCs with your partner running the pickle.

Mosey back through the baseball fields with a stop along the way for some ab work. Back on our feet and head to the rock pile on the backside of NH.

- 151 curls, triceps and rock press with your partner running to the steps and back

Mosey over to the kiosk.

- 151 carolina dry docks, lunges and dying cockroach with your partner running the hill

Mosey up and over to the billy line with an AYG back to the flag.

Some Mary and we out!

COT: 23, welcome FNG Wichita (2.0 to Never Ready)

NMS: Props to Pigeon for stepping up to take Co-Site Q duties at Phx. Good to see Napster in town!
