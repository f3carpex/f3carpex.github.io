Last night I dreamed of Q'ing FMJ and receiving a custom F3 FMJ koozie......like a badge of honor!  So cool!   
Instead, I got shafted just like Mark Gottfried shafted the Wuffpack. I got shafted by the Nantan Emeritus, now demoted to FMJ Site-Q, Ma Pythonless Bell. Def a low point in my life. But sheeeiiiit, I drink my Brooksweisers fast enough, so don't need your Koozie Ma Bell! I bet the other real Site-Q, Orphan, woulda remembered tho!

Especially disappointed after YHC delivered a flawless Q. I had big ideas for this workout, but as I told Peeeeiirogi on the way home, didn't get to any of my ideas.  
I did check for FNGs tho, and orated a disclaimer like never heard before.

Warm Up:  jog around that lil Gherkin pickle twice and circle up for some in perfect cadence GM, IWs, Hillbillies, MCs, Merkins, AirForceOnes, and a Saturday Night Stretch.  Then jog to the Hillock, which is apparently named by Michelob, but he had no idea what I was talking about.

Thang 1:  partner up at the top of Hillock.  
Partner 1 runs down to the tree and performs x 5 Sumo Squat Jumps, then runs back while Partner 2 quickly performs SSH.  Flip flop.  Repeato running to the next tree, with partner performing PJs......next Chilcut.....and so on until ran to all 3 trees at bottom of Hillock.

Then 2 lines Bataan Death March with HRMs x 3 to the mini lollipop until we got to the mini playground.  A set of x 20 dips and x 20 LBCs ensued.  Jog towards the football field, but stop at the 3-bar railing for ascending Derkins x 10 each.  Jog to the end football field, which was soppy wet with dew, like really wet. It was too late to turn back, shoes and socks were soaked. PAX complaining commenced.

Thang 2:  Modified 7s (I think it was starting with 12 and 5 reps) the length of the football field with RimTouchers on one end and Freddie Mercs on the other end. A couple sets also had some merkins at the 50 yd line.

Thang 3 & 4: The Human Agility Ladder with the Bob-and-Weave: start at one end of football field with 2 lines of PAX ~5 yd apart. Perform cutting and bobbing-and-weaving through their fellow PAX for the length of football field.  
\*\*\*\*It was at this point that I was reminded of the "3 mile minimum" (which is so dorky, by the way). A quick glance at my watch revealed that with less than 8 minutes to go, YHC was in deep doodoo for this "requirement".  
No problem: 2 lines of Indian Runs around the track for 2.5 laps.  
Then a brisk mosey to the first round-a-bout in front of the school for x 3 Merkins, then a brisk mosey to the Shovel Flag.....right on time.

COT  
Count-a-rama: 13 with a mixture of mehs and respects  
Name-a-rama  
Praises/Prayers: decisions by national and local leaders, the anxiety brought upon for the upcoming school year.  
Imp took us out like a champ!

Nekkid Mole Skin: well the field was wet. I knew it only really mattered to Denali because he is such a primadonna with his damn shoes. But Denali was late for the start of the workout because he was changing his shoes and putting on his lipstick. Don't get me wrong, I've had lipstick on me too........but only on my neck and HoChiMinh Trail after nookie.

twas a pleasure,  
luvyou,  
Flip Flop
