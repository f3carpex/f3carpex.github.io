It was a beautiful morning for a workout! There were no FNGs. Nonetheless, the mission, disclaimer, and pledge were recited. We started with a short run from the skate park to the parking lot in front of the baseball field for some warm-ups.

## Warm-ups

- Side Straddle Hops
- Good Mornings
- Cotton Pickers
- Sir Fazio Arm Circles
- Overhead claps
- Merkins
- Calf Stretch

After warm-ups, we ran to the private school.

## Thang One

- Fast feet
- Curb Merkins
- Bear Crawl to the other side of the parking lot
- Repeat x 3

We ran up to the baseball field which was conveniently open.

## Thang Two

The running pattern was to start at home plate, run to the first base foul post, do an exercise, run to the center field fence, do an exercise, run to the third base foul post, do an exercise, run home, do an exercise and wait for the 6.

- Squats x 20
- Superman Flutter x 20 cadence count
- LBCs x 20
- Merkins x 20

This pattern was repeated 3 times. Thanks, Sub, for always going back for the 6.

## Transition

The PAX paired up for a little Catch Me If You Can around the backside of the park. Partner One did 10 Merkins and Partner 2 ran off. We all ended up at the skate park for Mary.

## Mary

It was PAX choice Mary for the day starting with 15 reps for each exercise and being rationalized to 10 reps when someone called Burpees and we still had a dozen PAX to get through. Needless to say we ran out of time before everyone could call their favorite.

## COT

24 HIMs were present for the experience. Crazy train, Night Train, and the Odyssey were announced. In prayers, Ausfaht has graduated to a walker and may start posting occasionally to walk during workouts. A signup sheet will be developed to walk with him as he recovers. Others were lifted up out loud and in our hearts.

It was a pleasure leading you all. I do not have words for what this group of men has meant to me in the midst of my sixth decade on this earth. I am grateful to be a part of this.
