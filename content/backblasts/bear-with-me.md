33 degrees, gloom, and a light mist greeted the men at Gran Torino today, and didn't that was the weather that got FNG Back Porch out to his first post...at a High Tempo bootcamp.

After a short mosey, we got loose with a pretty standard workflow of side-straddle hops, calf-stretch merkins, mountain climbers, hillbillies, and treadwindmills.

Down the stretch we formed up into two lines for a bear run: back runner overtakes the leader, and after each cycle of runners drop to 10 bear crawls in cadence, twice around the double field.

Down to the Tennis Park for a classic Dora 1-2-3: 100 Merkins, 200 LBCs, 300 Squats for each pair.

Next, intervals along the lightposts: ON, OFF, ON, OFF, ON, recover to start, with 5 Merkins at each post during the recovery leg. Repeato. Finally, recover to the flag for some quick stretches to limber up the legs after intervals.
