Showed up for the prerun and they said I could pick the route since I was the Q. Great, I always like doing routes backwards so lets do that! Which one?? Humm, Option 2. I knew that one well. Fast forward 20 minutes or so and I am confidently telling Largemouth that we are looking for a left but we weren't. We missed the right turn but thankfully Largemouth got us back and only a minute or so late. 4 Milles - Good BRR training!

5 for the Prerun - Denali, Squatter, Michelob, Largemouth, and Chanticleer

Main Event - We got a little lip coming in late but we were quickly off around the lake for a warm up lap. We stopped a few times for warm up exercises and eventually made out way to the back of the big parking lot.

We then got a travelling rock for some Quad Fives Suicides. 5 overhead presses, 5 squats, 5 merkins on your rock, times 5 out and backs. This was a arm burner. Once complete, we ditched the rocks and completed without the rocks. 5 Hallelujahs, 5 squats, 5 merkins, 5 times. The second time was not surprisingly a lot easier!

Run back to the big parking lot for a few Imperial Walkers and all you got the flag. We finished with LSFs, Hello Dollies, Dying Cockroaches, and American Hammers.

I find planning workouts easier when I have a little inspiration so I finished with sharing Hebrews 12:1-2 my church sermon the day before.

"Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,Â looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God."

The rock we carried represented our weight and sin we choose to carry instead of setting it aside. Once we put the rocks down the workout was so much easier! Duh. I was hoping the metaphor would reminds us to let go of our sin and burdens we choose to hold onto instead of bringing them to God and running the race to Christ. He set the race before us and he is the reason he run! He was the only one that ran the race perfectly and we can be thankful for that as he is our only hope for righteousness and joy.

Thankful for a chance to lead and grateful to workout and spend time with you guys!
