A few weeks ago, I realized I had not Q'd a single Monday workout in 2021. Well, that seems to be a problem which needs fixing.

Meet up at 5:05 at Wolverine to run some hills with Ma Bell. Return to a parking lot of HIMs at 5:28.

## Warm Up

Run across the street to the pool parking lot. Circle up for Good Mornings, Sir Fazio arm circles, Steve Earles, Runner's stretch, calf stretch, with a little Pigeon thrown in there. May have done some SSHs.

## Thangz

Go to greenway entrance behind the pool, run to the bottom of the hill. Do 7s, Ma Bell picks Merkins at the bottom, I pick Steve Earles at the top.

Once complete run back to Davis Drive park. Number off 1s and 2s. While 1s run a loop to the bottom of the steps, up and to the playground, 2s do sets of 5 pull-ups, 10 squats, and 20 LBCs. Repeat this for about 4 rounds each.

Do a quick lap around the soccer field, stopping at various points for traveling Mary exercises. Once back to the basketball courts, run past to surprise the PAX and call one more set of Mary exercises. until about 6:13.

## Mary

We already did that.

## COT

13 of us. No Hates, 6 Respects, 7 Mehs. YHC took us out.

## NMS

- While we were running back to the park, Hi-Liter said to me "you didn't plan this Q, did you?". He was 63% incorrect on this.
- I was reminded of the olden days when Saban would remind the A-Team Q how long it takes to get back to the flag. Some of the PAX were concerned I didn't know it was 6:13 and we weren't back to the flag.
- Mission accomplished on that one.
- This is pretty good, under a week since I Q'd that I'm writing this backblast. I'll take that.
