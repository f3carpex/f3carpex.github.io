Whoever said getting old can't be fun? What better way to celebrate your birthday than challenge and push yourself beyond what you thought capable? Even better if a bunch of your friends are pushing you too! 22 HIM ventured out to the mean streets of Bond Park to ring in Franklin's 49th and YHC's 48th. Welcome to FNG Huckleberry, named for declaring his favorite movie as Tombstone.

Warm-Up: Franklin led the PAX on a friendly mosey to the kite field where we circled up in some moist grass for warmups. 49 merkins were done. 48 SSHs. And a few Sir Fazio Arm Circles, Seal Claps, and Hillbilly's. Sufficiently warmed up, we divvied up into 1's and 2's and took off for a really messy Indian Run to the upper parking lot where some treats were waiting for us.

Inspired by YHC's recent visit to Toledo/Sylvania, OH, we launched a head-to-head challenge, teams captained by the birthday boys. In teams of 1's and 2's, we faced off in an obstacle course challenge:

- Teams in plank at start; send next runner after previous returns heavy bag
- 5 Burpees/10 WW2â€™s
- Cone1- Heavy bag lunge carry to cone2/ walk the bag back to cone1 (thanks Carvana and Build-A-Bear for the heavy bags!)
- Run to cone3/crabwalk to cone4
- Farmer carry cinder block to cone5/return cinder block to cone4
- Run to cone5, bearcrawl to cone6
- Cone6-overhead rock carry to cone 7, return rock to cone6
- Run to cone7, 5 star jumps + 10 rock V-ups
- Run back to start

To keep it engaging, the awaiting team members indulged in various Mary and rock routines. A few supportive team members joined their teammates for encouragement. It was beautiful. Time permitted us to run the course 3 times and Team 2 reigned victorious each time. Everyone worked hard and had a few laughs along the way. Only one cinder block was sacrificed (thanks Texas Ranger for supplying them; sorry for your loss).

The losing team got to clean up the course while the winning team earned and extra round of Mary back at the flag.
