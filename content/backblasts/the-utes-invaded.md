With little planning put into it, YHC was still feeling some pressure this morning headed to Wolverine, largely because Red Baron was in town and waiting for me at the front door for our 0515 exit. Needless-to-say, we left on time.

22 are circled up (a bunch of Utes rolled out of the Meatloaf mobile) for Wolverine and with that we we took off... out of the perfectly good (albeit dark) park.

Down the street and over to the middle school for a circle up and: GM (Coach New needed a second chance at the GM disclaimer), Imperial Walkers, Ewalkers, Plank into an air raise and arm circle.

The Thang:

- Partner up for a good ole fashioned Dora 1-2-3
- After finishing up the Dora and extra lap we went back up to the park.
- Into the pavilion for LRSU, Erkins, Dips, Derkins on 3 rounds
- Over the hoops court for PC and BTTW (5 rounds with sprints in between)
- Mary to wrap us up

COT: 22 and Red Baron took us out

NMS:

- Tclaps to Meatloaf for the strong youth (aka Utes) contingent this morning. Awesome to crush it with those guys!
