9 PAX plus Press On's pooch gathered at Phoenix for YHC's 1 year anniversary. As the family is huge fans of Disney I figured we'd do an appropriately themed tour. Clear and ~40 degrees or so. Torpedo commented this is the first time this year he's started an F3 workout in the daylight...a beautiful one indeed.

### Warmup

Goofy Good Mornings x5 -- on a whim, counted with a GAWRSH which all enjoyed...  
Imperial Walkers x10 -- since Star Wars is now part of Disney  
Buzz Lightyear Arm Circles x10 F/R  
Mickey Mouse Merkins\* x5 -- counted in a high pitched Mickey voice upon request  
Side Straddle Hops x50 -- as this is the 50th anniversary for Walt Disney World

### Tomorrowland: Space Mountain Sevens

Mosey to the kiosk which is perfectly placed at the bottom of a hill. Called 7's with burpees and star jumps. Started with 0 burpees\*\* + 7 SJ's to make sure we got the maximum amount of pain.

### Avengers Campus: Superhero Dora

Mosey to the rock pile by the spillway and called for everyone to get a HULK ROCK. Some took me literally and grabbed massive boulders. Called a Dora, but Avengers style:  
\- 100 Peter Parker's  
\- 200 Curls for Hulks  
\- 300 Captain America Hammers  
Pax dug in to the challenge but YHC quickly realized a) this was going to take quite awhile and we still had more of the happiest place on earth to see, and b) this was extremely difficult. YHC called an audible to turn this in to 50-100-150, and as we were approaching the halfway point we finished up.

### Adventureland: Animal Antics

Mosey to the amphitheater\*\*\* where we had done bear crawls with Old Maid the previous week. Circle on the stage for 10-count exercises, then bear crawl up then crawl bear down around the amphitheater:  
\- Chase the Rabbits x10  
\- Bear Crawl | Crawl Bear  
\- Copperhead Merkins x10  
\- Bear Crawl | Crawl Bear  
\- Zebra Butt Kicks x10

### Main Street USA: Last Minute Souvenirs

Mosey to the wall behind the community center where it was time for a final trip down Main Street...except your kids/M want souvenirs/candy. Time to partner up:  
\- BTTW - imagine the ghost of Walt Disney shaking every bit of loose change from you  
\- Partner runs the pickle to the fire hydrant and grabs a souvenir\*\*\*\*  
\- Repeato x3

### Mary @ Flag

A perfectly timed 5 minutes of Mary concluded with Big Red calling 100's, expertly dragging on the last 10 with a stern warning for paying attention to the core... and a solid reminder of the current Core Challenge

### COT

Count-a-rama: 9 plus 1 pooch

Announcements: Core challenge\*\*\*\*\*, Piranha Park official launch

Praises for a gorgeous day, fantastic group of HIMs and our health.

### NMS

\* MMM's are Wide -> Diamond -> Wide Merkins as in WDW (Walt Disney World) per the Exicon. 'Nanza apparently was very glad we only did 5 of them  
  
\*\* I always felt 7's should start/end with seven as opposed to 6+1. PAX loved the 'zero burpees' to start  
  
\*\*\* YHC asked PAX their favorite Disney songs along the way and we heard a smattering - Hakuna Matata, Let It Go, Circle of Life, Mickey Mouse March... 'twas glorious  
  
\*\*\*\* Some brought sticks/pine cones but other creative 'souvenirs' included a MASK UP CARY sign. Needless to say we returned the souvenirs before we left  
  
\*\*\*\*\* YHC has been feeling the physical and emotional impact of F3 in a huge way over the past few months. What normally would be remembered as a wet and miserable winter during a pandemic has turned into me losing ~20 pounds, feeling stronger than I've been in years, finding myself leading more often, and grateful for a group of such supportive men. Thank you for letting me lead today, and I can't wait to see what the next year brings.
