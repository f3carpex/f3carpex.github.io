A bunch of Apex dudes invaded South Cary looking for a beatin'.

**Warm-Up** Mosey around t the back lot and circle up for counting off 1s and 2s. One group does AMRAP warm-up exercises while the other group runs around the balls. Watch out, they get really tight at the end. Imperial walkers, arm circles, mountain climbers and good mornings.

**The Thang** Mosey over to The Bridge for my version of 7-11s. 7 rounds of 7 monkey humpers on one side of the bridge, 7 dry docks on the other side of the bridge, with an 11-count balls to the wall in the middle each time we cross.

Mosey back to the rock pile for curls, presses, squats and rock-yo-body.

**Mary** Circle up back at the flag for dying cock-a-roaches, box cutters, cox butters and a tardy burpee burnout.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  13 **Name-a-rama**:  4 RESPECT, 9 meh, 0 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers lifted for Intimidator's mom, Bootlegger's cousin, Term Paper's daughter. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**  All of this workout was stolen from, or inspired by, other PAX. The warm-up idea came from Yoga Mat, the 7-11 idea came from Pigpen, BTTW on the bridge is probably from Hermes, even the joke about the balls getting tighter is from someone else, sounds like Ma Bell, I'm not sure. Thanks for the inspiration fellas.

Thanks to all the Apex guys who got up extra early to come hang out with me in Cary.

Love you guys!
