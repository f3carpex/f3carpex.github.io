Picasso is credited with saying, "good artists borrow, great artists steal". Whether Picasso coined that phrase is under debate, but I believe the sentiment to be true. I got this idea from Cauliflower at Rush Hour and expanded on it a bit.

Started with the pledge and mosey.

### Warm Up

- Good Mornings
- Elevator Merkins
- Imperial Walkers
- Runner's Stretch
- Sir Fazio Forward
- Seal Claps
- Sir Fazio Reverse

### Only Thang

All PAX grabbed a bell and a cinder block. Placed the block and the bell at the first island and mosey down to the second island. On my go, PAX ran to grab the bell and brought it to the second island. PAX then ran back and bear crawled while pushing the cinder block. Repeated this process three more times going from island two to island three, island three to island two, and finally back to island one. Added an exercise each time.

#### Round 1

- 5 Man Makers
- 10 Renegade Rows (10 per side)
- 15 Overhead Press
- 20 Rows

#### Round 2

Gave everyone a break this round with overhead carry of the block.

- 5 World War 2's
- 10 American Hammers
- 15 LBCs (One Crunch and One Press)
- 20 Freddie Mercuries w/ Bell Press

#### Round 3

- 20 Curls for Girls
- 15 Tricep Extensions
- 15 Squat Thrusters

Ended at the last island with have a nice day.
