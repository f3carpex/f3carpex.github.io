...as long as she squats. Just ask Smokey.

Any who...

15 pax deep for YHC's return to FWD. Been a minute since I've been at the second darkest AO in all of Carpex. A stellar mission statement, short disclaimer and we're off.

Warm-up: Over to the pickle lot for agility weave thru the balls (giggidy) and circle up for GM, SSH, Imperial Walker, EWalkers and quick feet/merkins on the curb

The Thang: Onto the dark trail and over to da bridge:

- Quick stop along the way to regroup and do merkins + squats
- At the bridge get a partner: 50 pullups, 100 merkins and 200 squats with a minimum of a combined 6 laps up and down the back hill (all with your partner not Dora style)
- After we're finished get the pax on the wall for People's Chair 15 count, BTTW 30 count, People's Chair 45 count, BTTW 60 count
- Move feet back to the lot with a stop to regroup along the way. A shooting star was witnessed by a handful of pax as we exercised at the stop.
- Back at the lot and grab a rock for curls + merkins, lap, triceps + squats, lap, press + rows, lap
- It's at this point during the squat when YHC is talking about holding that rock close like she's on a first date, at which Smokey should be thanked for his leadership for the line of "She's a good girl as long as she squats." A final round of speed curls, triceps, press and rows and we're headed back to the flag for Mary.

COT: 15
