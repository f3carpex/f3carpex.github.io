With the temperature up in the sixties it was Tank Top Tuesday at Rush Hour tonight.  Three HIM gathered at the flag ready to get stronger.

**Warm-Up**

Mosey over to the bank and triangle up for side straddle hops, imperial walkers, cotton pickers, plank jacks and calf stretches.

**The Thang**

Safely cross Chatham Street and try something new, the Five and Dime.  Mosey down Academy Street, stopping at each odd numbered light pole for five burpees, and at each even numbered light pole for ten calf raises.

Safely cross Dry Avenue and check the parking lot behind Cary Elementary.  Too much traffic, not safe for the PAX, so check the front of the school, all clear here.  Do modified 11's along the front sidewalk.  Round one was merkins and prisoner squats, round two was star jumps and LBCs.

Fellowship mosey back to the pocket park for a little wall work, ALRSUs, dips, ALRSUs, derkins, ALRSUs.

**Mary**

Triangle up and go around the horn.  Start with dying cock-a-roaches, rotate through a few others, and finish with the greatest Mary exercise ever created, the burpee.

**COT**

**Count-a-rama**:  3 **Name-a-rama**:  0 RESPECTs, 3 mehs, 0 HATES **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for Red Ryder's cousin's wife as she is treated for cancer, praises for PAX who have recovered from recent injuries. **BOM**:  YHC took us out.

**NMS**

I thought Hello Kitty was going to be our fourth, but he was in street clothes, just driving by to say, "Hey!"

The calf raises didn't feel like much at the time, but my calves are aching as I type.

I don't think I've used the front of Cary Elementary before, at Rush Hour or Bradford's Ordinary.  Most of the sidewalk is covered, which could be nice on a rainy day when the Q doesn't want to use the parking deck.

It was much warmer than usual, but still not quite warm enough to do COT with our feet in the fountain.

We had a small but strong group tonight.  The PAX stuck together throughout the beatdown which allowed lots of 2nd F with all that 1st F.

It was the first Rush Hour post for both Napster and Red Ryder.  I hope we see them again soon.

Thanks for letting me lead tonight.
