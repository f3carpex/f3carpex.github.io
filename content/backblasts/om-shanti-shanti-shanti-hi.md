**When: 07/24/2019**

Twenty five PAX gathered at 5:30 AM at Tortoises, the limited-run AO.  We had one FNG, started with the F3 disclaimer.  Welcome to AUSFAHT who came back after his crash and recovery.

**First exercise**

Pledge of allegiance at the flag. Mosey around the parking lot and circle up in front of the church. 

**Warm Up**

 Performed warm-up exercises in cadence:10 Good Mornings, 10 Windmills, 10 Surfazio arm circles, 10 Reverse Surfazio arm circles, 10 Seal Claps, and 10 Side straddle hops.  
Frisco tried to sneak in and earned 10 penalty burpees OYO for the PAX.  
Mosey back down the parking lot  to the coupon area.  

**Thang 1**

Partner up and one partner to get a coupon or two small coupons.  
Partner 1 get one coupon or two per partner   
Partner 1 Bear crawl to first light Lunge Walk back. Partner 2 Blockee (block burpee - burpee with the coupon). After about 5 rounds, heeding to the PAX grumbling, YHC discussed with Disco Duck for change of plans to include something different.    
Returned the coupons.  

**Thang 2**

Moseyed up the hill to the pull up bars area.  YHC instructed 5, 10, 15.  5 pull ups, 10 gherkins, 15 hand lifts. Repeat until Mary.  
All the while WWW kept AUSFAHT company and did limited exercises.  

**Mary**  
Circle up for Mary. YHC called on Disco Duck to lead a Mary. Disco Duck called 10 American Hammers.  Next called on Frisco who called for 20 burpees.    

**COT**

Count-a-Rama: 25 PAX; 5 respects, 4 hates  
FNG was called to the center. After getting to know him and some deliberation picked the F3 name SHIPPER.  SHIPPER did well for the first day and was already inquiring about the AO for Thursday and rest of the werk.  

**Announcements**

Earhardt announced Sasquatch on Saturday at Greenville for a 3 hour SEESOP.  

**Prayers and Praises**  
Quiver had praise for Western Wake AO for raising money for charity called Breathtaker.  This month the charity is **Make Smiles** and has raised about $6,000 in just 2 weeks. Prayer for daughter who is starting school.  
Prayers for AUSFAHT for returning to F3.  AUSFAHT was thankful for all the prayers and praised WWW for all the calls and encouragement to come out.  

**Take Out by Traffic Cone**

Prayers and ended the COT with Om Shanti Shanti Shanti HI, pray for peace in body, speech, and mind.

  
**Final thoughts**  
VQ was invigorating to lead fine group of wonderful gentlemen. Thanks for the PAX for overlooking the mistakes and supporting.  Special thanks to Disco Duck for encouragement.  Thanks to Earhardt for suggesting me to CoQ.  Hope to have a better Q next time!!!
