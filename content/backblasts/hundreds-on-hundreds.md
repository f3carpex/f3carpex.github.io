Twas a beautiful morning at FWD as 18 pax gathered for a beatdown.  YHC has made it a goal to Q a lot more this year, so this was the first of several more to come!  So, after the disclaimer and the F3 mission statement was given to our FNG, we recited the Pledge of Allegiance and were off.

**Warmup**:

After running around to the far part of the parking lot, we circled up for:

**Good morning**

**Imperial Walkers**

**SSH**

**Seal Claps**

**Mtn. Climbers**

**Thang 1**:

Run the trail to the bridge for “**Bridge 7’s**.” (stopping half way to do some **Merkins**).  We did 6 **Burpees** on one side of the bridge to 1 **WWII** on the other, with 2 **Jump Squats** every time we passed the center.

**Thang 2**:

Mosey back to parking lot (stopping in the middle to do some LBC’s) and partner up for a modified **Rock Dora**:  100 **Overhead Presses**, 100 **American Hammers,** and 100 **Squats**.  P1 started the exercises while P2 run the pickle weaving in between the big stone balls.

**Mary**:

Mosey back to the flag, and **Bear Crawl** from the flag to the BB benches and back. Then we got to Mary:

**V Ups**

**Dying Cockroaches**

**100’s**

**Have a Nice Day**

**COT**:

     **Pax**\- 1 Hate, 14 Meh, 3 Respect

     **FNG**\- Welcome **Clear Cut**

     **Announcements**\- The Mule on the 14th, Burgaw on the 21st, Tobacco road half/full marathon on the 15th.

     **Prayers/Praises**\- Hello Kitty’s wife traveling for the funeral of her uncle, good health for all the ones running the marathon, YHC’s dad’s back, and for any and all the pax out on IR. 

YHC took us out!

**NMS**:  Great work fellas!!  It was certainly an honor to branch out and lead you guys at another AO thats not named Rush Hour or Phoenix, and I look forward to doing it again!
