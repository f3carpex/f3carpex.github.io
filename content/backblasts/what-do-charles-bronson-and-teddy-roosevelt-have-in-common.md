Nothing actually...until today. Theodore Roosevelt once spoke about the "man in the arena." That man was Charles Bronson.

12 HIM showed up brighter than normal. Most drove @Hot Spot, @Michelob, @Old Maid and @Squatter ran in for a little EC.

**Warm Up**

We ended up taking the long way to the basketball court from the flag. Bat Wings (20x forward arm circles, reverse arm circles, seal claps, overhead claps. @Frankiln then forced us to hold our arms out for a long slow count from 0-9) Hillbilly, Mountain Climber, Plank Jack

**Thang 1**

Again, we took a longer than necessary route but this time to the soccer fields for Charles Bronson. This exercise consist of 5 rounds. Each round you perform 50 reps of an exercise, then sprint to the opposite end of the field's penalty box line thingy, army crawl to end of field then mosey back to start and repeat. The 5 exercise were SSH, Merkin, Burpee, LBC, Jump Squat.

**Thang 2**

Bear Crawl Snake. We broke up into two groups of six. 5 HIM held plank, while the 6th bear crawl weaved their way through to the front of the line, followed by the last man in the line, etc. until we went from one end of the field to the other.

Barry Sanders back to the flag.

**Mary**

A slow and controlled round of Boat to Canoe, 100's.

**COT**

No Announcements. No praises.

Prayers for Hi Liter and his family, Ascot's family, Hot Spot's parents, Sooey's friend.

YHC took us out with the passage from Theodore Roosevelt's "Citizenship in a Republic" speech that inspired this workout. Most of you know it as "The Man in the Arena."

> "It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."
