Hello Kitty graciously allowed me to grab this Q for my 45th birthday celebration.

Site-Q Biner mentioned the greenways hadn’t been explored much so that setup our prime directive – destination White Oak Park west along the White Oak greenway.  Park is only about 1 mile away with a lighted shelter, basketball and tennis courts.

There is a playground along the way for the neighborhood tucked back in there so we stopped and did some work.
