AO: DANGER ZONE

QIC: WRENCH

PAX: BLOWOUT, BURT, CHEWIE, CONEY, KWIK STOP, PRESS ON, SABAN, SNAP BACK, WRENCH

Woke up early and getting ready to go, my 2.0 comes in with a stomach ache. He scurries into bed with the M, but those few minutes threw me off enough where I was whipping into a parking spot in just the knock of time, all but a disclaimer running up to the circle.

after the disclaimer, the pledge, took a quick mosey down to the corner of the soccer field. Quick warm up of:

10x GM

10x SF Arm Circles, forward and backwards

10 count tricep stretch

We get started. Burt wanted Vanilla, so I kept a vanilla concept, but had to put a twist on it. Dora, 100 Mike Tyson's, 200 Mountain Climbers, 300 shoulder taps. Bear crawl across the field and back. Thought process was most of the time would be down in plank/bear crawl position, no need to stand up straight. Sounds horrible. Sounds fun.

In my mind that should have filled up the time, but those long bear crawls suck, and the need to modify sped up the process.

So we mosey again. Along the way, we do Burpees, merkins, squats, imperial walkers, up to the covering for L/R step ups. Kwik Stop, being the absolute monster he is, decided it wasn't good enough and decided to do box jumps on the table top. Impressive to say the least. Mosey the long way back, up the stairs near the playground and around to the flag.

Pax called Mary, with American Hammers (always a crowd favorite), Eskimo Merkins, plank Jack's, and Press On's Crunchy Frog, a Boat/Canoe and Cannonball mix that I hated, which really means I need more of those in my life, to get better and not hate them.

Announcements: 4 July convergence a No-Go, so Q slots open for both Phoenix and TGM, and DZ slot was open for the 3rd, but Saban snatched it right up.

Prayers/Praises: YHC and the job complications.

YHC took us out, with a Pro Sooey move of embracing the beauty that is the morning before the prayer.

NMS:

Volleyball court was in use, thought I may lose Burt to be a spectator.

Long bear crawls are not fun

Coney was afraid I wasn't a runner, thinking there would be more of this nonsensical hands and feet exercises.

It's always a blessing to be in the company of men of the highest impact.

MIAGD!
