I wasn't sure what kind of attendance to expect at a high tempo 0530 workout the morning after our Carpex Christmas party.  With three Gran Torino site Qs, I figured that means there should be at least four of us.  Turns out an impressive group of 15 only slightly subdued PAX showed up for their post-party beat down and my first GT Q.  Here's what we did:
