PAX: Ausfaht, Bogo, Nature Boy, Schroeder, WWW

I was excited to pre-blast and highlight the workout because the original workout Q is known to create a super tough workout. Unfortunately, as 5:30 am rolls around, no workout Q. So, YHC stepped in as QIC to lead the men.

We started with the Pledge Allegiance to Old Glory. Then we walked and warmed up at the same time around the pickle before the thang.

Thang 1: Table work with pull-ups sprinkled in for 3 rounds. Irkins, dips, L/R step-ups or squats, abs, pull-ups.

Thang 2: Wall work. 1st round BTTW while each PAX does 10 merkins down the line. 2nd round: People's chair while two PAX does boxcutters. 3rd round: people's chair again while 2 PAX does mountain climbers.

Thang 3: Parking Line work. Lunge walk to a line and do 3 burpos until you reach the island. Repeato lunge walk but this time doing jump squats.

End the workout with Mary around the horn with each PAX calling out their favorite Mary for 10 reps.

COR: 5 HIMs

NOR: 3 Respects and 2 mehs.

Announcements: Blood drive,

Prayers/Praises: Men spoke from their hearts.

NMS: Original workout Q DM me stating he slept through his alarm. I always say. It is OK because when you sleep through an alarm, your body needed it.

Stay blessed men. It is always a pleasure to Q amazing men through a workout.
