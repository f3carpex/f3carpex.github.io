This backblast is a little late coming as it is from my birthday Q on 8/20, but as you get older you tend to forget things. Any way, as most are aware it's BRR season and another HIM suggested those of us running the BRR should be sure to take all the open Q slots for BRR inspired workouts. Well, one of my typical training routes goes right through HFT and from the light at Olive Chapel and Kelly Road to Kelly at Beaver Creek Commons appeared to be the perfect "halfpipe" if you will. I checked it out on a training run and the distance seemed perfect so we were all set. Here's what we did:

**Warmup**: 25 + handful more showed up at the flag at 0530 to help celebrate my birthday with me! Needless to say I was blown away by the attendance to say the least. No FNGs, so quick disclaimer and pledge and we headed out the driveway. We stopped and circled up near the entrance for the usual:  
SSH x 15 IC  
Good Mornings x 5 IC  
Sir Fazio Arm Circles x 10 IC  
Seal Claps x 10 IC  
Imperial Walkers x 10 IC  
Plank Jacks x 10 IC  
Calf Stretch L/R x 10 silent count each side

**Thang**: Mosey to the corner of Kelly and Olive Chapel on the Publix side. Double 7s (sorta). 6 Burpees at that corner, run to the bottom of the "halfpipe" for 5 LBCs, then to the next traffic light at Beaver Creek Commons for 6 merkins. Head back to the start, each time increasing by 5 LBCs at the bottom and decreasing Burpees and Merkins by 1 each time. We didn't have time to finish them all, but overall I think everyone received a proper beatdown.

**Mary**: Mosey back across the street to the flag for:  
Runner's Stretch L/R x 10 silent count  
Pigeon Stretch L/R x 10 silent count

YHC took us out.

Thanks again to everyone that came out to help me celebrate the beginning of the last year of my 30s. F3 has been a HUGE part of my life as a 38 year old and I expect that to continue in the subsequent years. I have made many new friends and men that I know I can count on if I ever needed anything. It's definitely MORE than a workout! MIAGY!
