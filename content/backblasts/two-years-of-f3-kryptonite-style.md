With 9/9 a Sunday (and YHC attending Wood Badge training with Chop Block somewhere in the nether regions of Carthage, NC), my Q-nerversary was scheduled months ago at Kryptonite. But between work, Scout training and various work-related shennanigans, YHC had been averaging ~4.5 hours of sleep since last Wednesday so Q'ing Kryptonite was going to be less than ideal.

Then realization dawned. With the BRR only days behind them and the annual 9/11 stair climb the following day, it was likely that many of the CARPEx faithful would be ok with taking it a bit easy. So, with expectations set appropriately low:

#### Warm Up:

- 52 IC SSH
- 1 maddening glare from @hermes
- 30 merkins

#### Thang:

Form up into 3-man groups and Indian Run over to 2000 Regency Park

21's on the hill all the way to the back of the parking lot:

- 1 -> 21 Starjumps (by 2s)
- 21 -> 10 Merkins (by 1s)
- 1 -> 21 Burpees (by 2s)

We got to 17-13-17 before it was time to head back.

Indian Run back to the flag

#### Mary:

- 20 merkins
- 52 IC LBC

#### COT:

- 9 got after it this morning
- Announcements: 9/11 Stair climb... Picnic on Sunday (later cancelled due to Florence)... VQ week... Band-aid drive
- Prayers: Michelob's 2.0

#### NMS:

- Although many a PAX did fartsack, those who came out were beastly. It took a lot to keep up. Especially with Thurston!
- BB's rock. I'm happy that you can still find the below online:
    - Pierogi 1-year party here: https://f3carpex.com/2017/09/09/still-shakin-or-bakin-three-hundred-and-sixty-five-days-later/
    - My first post, care of @burt's BB, here: https://f3raleigh.com/boogity-boogity-boogity-or-shake-n-bake
- It's been a fun 2 years. Some days have been easier than others but I'm happy @flipflop EH'ed me and I stuck with it during that first gloomy winter. The 1st F is great, the 2nd F a blast and the 3rd F, while not the one I exercise the most, definitely adds the special sauce that makes this group special
