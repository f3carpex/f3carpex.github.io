Picking up and hanging with Capt Kirk is always a treat. He is a mumblechatter master. Put him in a workout together with Horatio and you have F3 Gold.

Such it was this afternoon at RushHour. A fine mist (more on this in a bit) hung in the air as I called up the dear Captain to make sure he was indeed up for a DTC beatdown.

Come 1740, as I pull up to his house, Kirk is on the phone with a friend (that infamous one-hit-wonder Spock, it turns out) lamenting the fact that it's raining.

> "Rain? No way, that's just drizzle," I explain.
> 
> "Brian says we're crazy," retorts Kirk, pulling himself into the Jeep.
> 
> "That's cause he doesn't like mist"
> 
> \- Overheard on the way to Rush Hour

Which of course leads us to a discussion of that 1993 classic, [Myst](https://myst.com/). Who knew that there have been something like six sequels and that a new edition in the series was recently released on the XBox? Kirk, of course!

Let me tell you, the ride flew by. We arrive and chatter with the boys. Press On is finishing a 50 pull-up set I get an idea. It's cold. It's raining drizzling misting. It's time to go.

### Warm-up:

Mosey to the Page statue near Townhall and circle up for SSH, Squats, Sir Fazios, Merkins . Horatio does like the fact that Sir Page is staring at him so we bear crawl around the circle in between warmups. Capt Kirk shares that he's met Mr. Page's son. Or grandson. Or maybe it was Mr. Bond. Or the other guy with the big park named for him. We are doing great.

### Thang 1:

Mosey to the Chamber of Commerce parking lot, pausing for traffic and throwing in some monkey humpers.

11's (+1) with Parking Spot Bear Crawls on the bottom, Burpees on the top.

### Thang 2:

Mosey over to the old parking deck. Some dips and stuff en route.

15-10-5 set of L/R step ups + irkins + dips + derkins.

- Love Rush Hour
- Fun shoulder work today with a great group of dudes.
