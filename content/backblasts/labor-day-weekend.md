LABOR DAY weekend ... the official end of summer. Most kids are back in school and the days are turning cooler, a little. There was plenty of heat at AO Phoenix for starting off the LABOR DAY weekend right.

Yogi had locked in the Q at Phoenix for today, but he handed it off to YHC during the week. I wanted to EH a HIM to co-Q, so new guys will keep stepping up and Q'ing. YHC was looking for someone who had never Q'd at Phoenix before. So, Parker steps up to volunteer ... not a Virgin Q at all for this guy, but it is his first time with a Q, or co-Q, at Phoenix. We did a little pre-Q planning and decided YHC would take the first half and he would finish off the beatdown with the second half.

When YHC arrived at the parking lot Yoga Mat and Freebird were there wondering what happened to the 0605 EC run. Hey, sorry, but YHC had to make sure Eveready, YHC's neighbor, made it out again, so no EC run today.

WARM-UP: Moseyed down to the parking lot of pain for warm-ups consisting of Good Mornings, Arm Circles, Merkins, Plank Jacks, Merkins, Mountain Climbers, Merkins. Then, we did a Circle Burp, with the PAX doing SSH's while each PAX member did two burpees around the circle in turn in a clock-wise direction.

Thang 1: To get the heart rate up, we sprinted from one end of the parking lot to the other, and then did 5 burpees, OYO. Repeato. Repeato again. Repeato again. RECOVER ...

Thang 2: At the parking lot of pain, we looked up the street at the light poles. I explained that we would travel up from one light pole to the next with a particular exercise and then do WWII's each time until the six got there. First exercise was Lunge walk ... up to the next light pole and then WWII's. Second exercise was Ape hops ... same thing as guerilla hops, but I need it to start with an A since I was spelling the word LABOR. Third exercise was Broad Jump Burpees, which everyone **_loved_**. Fourth exercise was OYO, meaning PAX members did whatever they wanted up to the next light pole. Fifth exercise was Run, ... half speed, then full speed, then half speed.

We spelled LABOR, but YHC had a few more minutes to cover, and so we did LA again. Thankfully, time ran out before we got to the Broad Jump Burpees again.

First half is done, and Parker takes over ... everyone cheers.

Thang 3: Parker leads the way behind the community center building to a sturdy wall for an exercise YHC had never done called the Dirty Hookup (look it up in the Exicon) ... Flip Flop said he'd done the Dirty Hookup before but not like this. Anyway, after the Dirty Hookup, Parker led in American Hammers and then Y - ups ... to spell, you guessed it, DAY, and then repeato.

Thang 4: PAX formed two lines for an Indian Run down to the Kiosk. At the Kiosk we did partner Derkins, then sprinted down a ways for more partner Derkins and something new called Yul Brynner (again, check the Exicon). If you like "world's worst merkins" you'll love Yul Brynners!

About 5 minutes left, we headed back to the stop sign for a Billy Run to the flag and had several minutes of Mary back at the flag to finish off.
