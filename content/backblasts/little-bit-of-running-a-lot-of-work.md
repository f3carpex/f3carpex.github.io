YHC was NOT going to miss this one! After last week's brain fart, I put a plan together OYO in my head and set the alarm early. The first one to arrive, I decided to explore a little bit. What's this hill back here? Hmmm, Omaha! New plan. 6 more PAX showed up, including the long lost WWW. After a bit of catching up, we jogged over at 0530 to the front parking lot for some paint the lines and quick feet before circling up for:

- 10 x Good Mornings IC
- 15 x Merkins IC
- \[some number\] x Plank Jacks IC

The Thang

Jog to the back of the main parking lotÂ  by the shed and...10 burpees OYO. Back of the shed, grab 2 concrete cores and circle up for

- 30 x Alternating Curls IC
- 20 x Overhead Presses IC
- 10 x Lateral Raises IC

So, about that hill...past the church, there's a nice little hill dropping down to a neighborhood. Grab your cores and jog to the bottom of the hill at the speed bump (or as Freebird calls it: "that yellow line") for some Jacob's Ladder. Increasing number (up to 7) of Core Jacks (holding the cores while doing SSH) IC at the top of the hill, 10 merkins each trip back down at "that yellow line."

After some plank-o-rama at the bottom, put the cores over your heads and mosey back to the shed. 15 x core rows before putting them back. Jog across the parking lot by the basketball goal and line up.

1 PAX runs a figure 8 around the first 2 islands while the next PAX in line does merkins. The PAX behind him do squats. When runner returns, he goes to the back of the line. Everyone moves up as each runner returns until the last runner is done.

Repeato with LBCs at the front of the line and SSH for everyone else Repeato with WWIIs at the front and Plank Jacks for everyone else

Circle up for Mary-Go-Round (I just made that up). Each PAX takes a turn calling a Mary exercise. 44 seconds to spare. We have time for...10 merkins IC - slow count to 3 down, then up.

COT **Count-a-rama**: 7 **Name-a-rama**: 1 RESPECT, 6 Mehs, 0 Hates **Announcements**: Churham "Special Ops Surviors" events this weekend; Fathers Day F3 Dads event; Denise Moore 5K on June 24. **Prayers**: WWW's friend; safe travels for Texas Ranger; Khakis **BOM**: Ma Bell took us out

NMS

- During the lateral raises, someone said something about Banjo and a training bra. I don't even want to know.
- Freebird, it's a speed bump bruh. Designed to slow down cars.
- During the figure 8, our boys the Doobie Brothers pulled up to the shed at the other end of the parking lot. I had to give Freebird a tutorial on some _real_ Doobie Brothers songs.
- I swear I'm not picking on Freebird
- We were missing Yogi and his Yogi-isms today
