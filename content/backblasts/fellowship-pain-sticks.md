Last week at Rush Hour the fountains were frozen, this week we were all wearing short sleeves.

**Warm-Up**

Mosey around the parking lot a couple of times then circle up.  We often go around the horn during Mary, but why not the warm-up?  So we went around the horn doing side straddle hops, imperial walkers, cotton pickers and calf stretches.

**The Thang**

Mosey back behind the parking deck and grab a pain stick.  What?  YHC has said multiple times that we'd never use pain sticks at one of my Q's.  Over the last year I've done many things I thought I'd never do, and that's going to continue this year.  Sometimes we gotta do things we don't like in order to get better.

Carry the pain sticks over to the grassy area for the worst version of 7's ever.  Bear crawl while pushing the pain sticks to the other side (hat tip to Captain Insane-o), six squats, carry the pain sticks back, one merkin, etc.

Put the pain sticks back and mosey over to the wall next to the parking deck elevator.  One man runs up one flight of stairs, does one burpee, and runs back down while the other three alternate between BTTW and people's chair.

Mosey over to the pocket park and relive Slide Rule's FWD Q from this morning.  IRKINS, DERKINS 'N DIPS!

**Mary**

Circle up for dying cock-a-roaches, American hammers, Freddie Mercurys, LBC's, low slow flutters and Homer-to-Marge.

**COT**

**Count-a-rama**:  4 **Name-a-rama**:  0 RESPECTs, 2 mehs, 2 HATES **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for Riptide's M Ashleigh, she sprained her ankle this afternoon, prayers for a quick recovery. **BOM**:  YHC took us out.

**NMS**

I picked up my 2.0 from school on the way over, and the Camp Gladiators were in the parking lot.  Standing around while some guy throw a tennis ball for his dog.  Is that what they call a work out?

The weather tonight was PERFECT.  A nice break from the arctic weather we've had recently.

The site Q forgot to bring the flag AGAIN so we had to do penalty got to do reward burpees.  Burpees aren't a penalty, burpees are a reward.

Nice to have Mojo out again, he was a little shy at his first post, but he seemed more comfortable tonight.  He's a good kid.

Nice to have Aristocrat back from California.  He had asked me to take it easy on him, and reminded me of that when we got the pain sticks.  Hey, at least we weren't running.

The PAX stayed close together while doing the pain stick sevens, which allowed some good fellowship.  So going forward I'll call them fellowship pain sticks.

Small group tonight, but a strong group of amazing HIM.  Thank you for letting me lead.
