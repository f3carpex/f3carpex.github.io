It was a big day in downtown Cary as 24 PAX gathered to celebrate the 4th anniversary of the premier downtown AO in Carpex. It was also conveniently enough YHC’s 4th anniversary in F3. Unfortunately, my co-FNGs on that faithful day, Ma Bell (traveling), Baby Face (moving), and Lab Rat (never to be seen again) were unavailable to join in the festivities.

To honor the day and the OGQ Wonk (who did make a rare appearance in the gloom), we decided to pay homage to the first (yet to be named) BO workout. You can read that backblast (which was probably more timely that this one) here:

After everyone was tank topped up and received a (lengthy) background on the theme of the day, we jogged over to the Post Office parking lot for warm ups. SSH, Good Morning, Squats, and (inexplicably) LBCs (which even more inexplicably were interrupted by car whose occupant was trying to come mail a letter at 5:47 AM).

Crossed the street to the vacant grassy area for Jack Webbs.

Over to the small hill. Partner up. Partner 1 run to the top of the hill for 5 burpees, Partner 2 holds plank position (X 3)

Mosey up to the corner park and the grassy area. 1. Bear Crawl across (10 Squats), Bear Crawl back. 2. Lunge Walk across (10 Squats), Lunge Walk back. 3. Bear Crawl across (10 Squats), Bear Crawl Back.

Jog over to the Arts Center for Dips, Irkins, Dirkins, and Quick Feet. 10 Burpees. Repeat

Jog to the Library for Mary: LBCs, Hello Dolly, Homer to Marge, Dying Cockroach, American Hammer.

Back to Home for Plank-o-Rama. Regular (5 Count around the circle), Putin style, Sarkozy style, Chilcutt, Regular (5 count around the circle).

Ended with COT where Methlab was renamed to Tope, Isotope, or (Iso)tope.

It’s been an amazing 4 years here in Carpex and looking forward to celebrating many more anniversaries.
