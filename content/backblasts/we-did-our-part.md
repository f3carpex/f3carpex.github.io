YHC & Chanticleer for a safe distance EC run

The government (and FUMC) approved 9 PAX showed up for a community safe distance workout.

**Warm-UP  
**We circled up for Good Mornings, Windmill, Steve Earle, Arm Circles, Seal Clap, Overhead Clap, and Plank Jacks.

Mosey through the parking lot with some Karaoke and backward running thrown in for fun.

**The Thang  
**Perform called exercises, either OYO of IC. If you have to stop ort take a break you are "penalized" by running 3 parking spaces ahead, as often as you need to. When exercise is complete you return back to start, then run the distance of the parking lot (which is still being debated by Riptide and Callahan) and back to the start.

Exercises were 100 squats, 90 Mnt Climbers, 80 Merkins, 70 L/R shoulder Taps, 60 IC SSH, 50Star Jumps, 40 WW2, 30 IC Low Slow Flutter, 20 Burpees, 10 Turkish Get Ups

We finished it off with a variety of plank position 10 counts.

Mosey back to the flag

Announcements: Be safe and VHS has Toilet Paper  
No Prayers/Praises

NOTE: In what could be taken as a sign of the Apocolypse, Saban was overheard saying he wasn't worried about when we finished because he has the time now.

YHC took us out with a quote from Abraham Lincoln

> "The dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise -- with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew.”
