BRR season is upon us, whether the Pax like it or not.

Several crushed the Cauliflower EC, but since I rolled in at 5:13, I can't tell you exactly who.

5:15 start. No shovel flag with good brother Snip at the beach, but I noticed on my drive in that the Town of Cary mounted flags around Koka Booth for the 4th, so we moseyed to the traffic island where we were surrounded by Old Glories. Pledge, warm-up, cross Ederlee.

Thing 1: Ederlee Hill x3

Thing 2: Avenue of the Estates Hill x3

By hill six, I was hearing about Bastille Day and mutiny. We made it back with the Q's head intact, though. All told, we got in 3.9 miles and 390 feet of elevation. I tried to take the mileage title for the day, but Mama's Boy put up a crazy 4.75 at El Cap, despite his "we're going to lift and not be wimpy runners" preblast.

Hermes' Rule for Qing: take the average attendance of your regular AOs and don't let that number of weeks go by without Qing there. Otherwise, you're taking more than you give. This is good advice. I'm overdue across the board, and I will be fixing that in the coming weeks.

Hoppin John's 2-year anniversary is next week at BiB. HC.
