YHC took us out.

NMS. Just the 2 of us. Lots of great fellowship. RushHour is good for this. It's been a while since YHC has seen Cheese. A lot is going on with each of us, it was good to re-connect and lift one another up. Cheese has moved his Message Therapy bidness and now working above a tap room in Holly Springs with an Ancupuncturist. Men, if you or your wife are in need, reach out to Cheese
