The title will make sense, eventually...

There was chatter of a TTTuesday, so YHC broke out his middle school basketball jersey. Hmmmmm, fits well. Me thinks we wore them baggie... or was I beefy... either way.

18 wide-eyed pax showed up for a rain beatdown w/ 3 FNG's taboot. After a quick disclaimer, we're off.

Warm up:

- Mosey to the upper lot
- Good mornings
- SSH
- Ma Bell Merkins (Ma Bell not present)
- Sir Fazio fronty and backy
- Merkins again, why the heck not
- Hold it... Mountain Climbers
- I'm stealing this from Texas Ranger, to the parking spaces for a rolling 4-pack (as called by the PAX) of Curb Merkins, Mountain Climbers, Plank Jacks, and Quick Feet (x10 each)

Thang 1:

- Grab an ego rock
- 20 curls...Hermes drops a classic Hermes jokes and enough is enough... 5 penalty burpees... weave the cement blocks and run the lot
- 20 rock press... Hermes can't contain himself and rolls another classic out... 5 more penalty burpees... weave the cement blocks and run the lot
- 20 tricep extensions... Hermes does Hermes... 5 more penalty burpees... weave the cement blocks and run the lot
- 20 rock rows... he didn't make a joke but we still did 5 burpees... then we crushed a 3-pack of curls (bottoms, tops, and full)... weave the cement blocks and run the lot
- Mosey up to the pavillion

Thang 2:

- Let's get a break from the rain
- L/R Step Up
- Erkins
- L/R Step Up
- Erkins Repeato "Hey where are the dip" ... "They're coming"
- L/R Step Up
- Dips (x20)... hold... dips (x10)
- L/R Step Up
- Derkins
- Mosey on back to the b-ball courts

Thang 3:

- Bear crawl from sideline to sideline... 10 squats... lunge back
- Partner wheel-barrels... 10 squats... wheel-barrel back
- Crab walk... 10 carolina dry docks... lunge back
- Repeato

Mary:

- Just enough time for some boat canoes, Homer-to-Marge, LBCs and plankstuff

Prayers:

- Smokey's father-in-law, Ron, for his health
- YHC took us out

NMS:

- That jersey looked good you guys, pumped to break it out at TTT soon enough
- Great to have my boy 10-99 back out there. Y'all keep the pressure on him, he lives right next to FWD and is running the half with us in March.
- Awesome to have a trio of FNGs out today including The Mooch (his sister is the WH Pres. Sec.), Netscape, and Interstellar.
- OK, the title of this BB. Interstellar said 311 was his first concert and YHC named him Interstellar. Then YHC started thinking and researching... might have swung and missed on that one (help me find the song or album). Sorry Interstellar, if you make it back to the Gloom (he does missionary work in Nicaragua) it will be a good story to tell.
- Thanks for following me around in the slop this morning. I was on the road all day yesterday looking forward to this Q. Love you guys, and until the next time, SYITG. --Kitty
