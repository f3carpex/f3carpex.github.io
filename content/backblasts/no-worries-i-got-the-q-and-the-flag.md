It was Monday night and I get a text from Hermes asking if I will be there tomorrow. I thought "of course." Text him back and quickly get signed up for the vacant Q and get solo site Q duties.  No worries. Fortunately I have been to a few F3 workouts so I poached off ones I enjoyed.

**Warm up**

SSH, IW, GM, Plank Jacks, Merkins

**Thang 1** (Thanks Michelob and Whiplash)

Run toward the bridge and stop at the T in the greenway

Run to the bottom of the hill 15 Spiderman Merkins, run to the top 25 Jump Squats, run to the middle of the bridge 10 Pull ups, then back down the other side the same way.
