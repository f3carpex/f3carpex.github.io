Beautiful sunrise this morning at Dante’s Peak in the western suburbs off the Peak of Good Living….!  Moist & steamy this early – gonna be a hot one!…..

16 HIMs gathered -- no FNG.  F3 intro given & we started with the pledge.  Moseyed around the tennis court loop to the cul-de-sac for:

The Warm Up

Circle up for good mornings, Abe Vigodas, calf stretch w/merkins, mountain climbers, hillbillies, SSH, etc.  Mosey over to the soccer field for:

Thang 1 –

Modified 7’s working opposite corners of the field – descending Burpees & ascending CDDs – modification was 20 LBCs between each stop – so we did over 200 of those suckers…. Bikini season afterall…..

Circle up at center field for :

Thang 2 –

Ring-of-Fire – bear crawl around the circle, halt & hold plank.  Everyone holds plank while we take turns with 5 merkins, 5 wide merkins, 5 offset right merkins, 5 offset left.  Fire for sure.  Flipped to work the legs, so lunge-walked the circle, stopped for prisoner squats on my up/down, more lunges, then sumo squats of the up/down.  Hard work there….

Mosey to end of field for two rounds of suicides….. Q is smoked.

Mary time – Side plank star crunches, DC’s, H-T-M, and finally, H-A-N-D.  Sweat-fest.
