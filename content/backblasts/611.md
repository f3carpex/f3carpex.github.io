Here we are! My first ever Limited Run Q! I'd been to Claymore once before (and Tortoises about 3 times), but limited run always makes me nervous... nevertheless here we are.

6 for EC down to Lake Pine and back via the Greenway.

Warm up: GM / IW / SSH / HB / SFAC / rSFAC / OC / CP / Merkins / MC / PJ / Calf Stretch

FIND A ROCK!

Matthew 6:11 is our guiding principle today - "Give us this day our daily bread." And here's how we got that bread:

Burpees / Rock Your Body / Erkins / American Hammers / Dying Cockroaches  
we went 1-5, escalating up to 7-35 as we mosey around the park.

Return the rocks and head back to the cars for Mary, consisting of:  
LBC / BC / H2M / HAND

THAT'S IT

COR - 12  
NOR - 4 RESPECTs, 6 meh, 2 HATEs

Announcements  
Shu'tan's House Thursday night  
2F2F Friday at Smokey's in Morrisville  
Q school in 2 Saturdays

Prayers  
Frisco / Gilligan / Eden / Parker's FIL

Short and sweet today on the BB. Very blessed to be a part of it this morning.
