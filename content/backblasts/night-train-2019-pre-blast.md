### What

15-mile(+/-) ruck. Take the train from Cary to Raleigh. Ruck back. Tentative route: https://goo.gl/maps/8pvKG1XMiqdZcFgN9

Potential for a mid-ruck rehydration stop, late join or early bail-out near the halfway point (Food Lion at Tryon and Lake Wheeler). Let the Q's know if you plan to join late.

Train tickets are $6 in advance online, a few bucks more at the station day-of.

### When

Saturday, July 13. Form up 9:15pm. Train scheduled for 2153 departure. We should be done by 0330 if the train is on time. (big if, based on recent Crazy Train experience)

### Where

Start at Cary train station. Ruckoff location nearby, TBA.

### Who

Anybody. F3, FIA, SadClown, Joe or Jane 6-pack, everyone's welcome.

Your QICs are HotCakes and Horatio. Sound off in the #rucking slack channel with questions.

### Patches?

Naturally!
