The idea was to run a loop and on said loop catch the Maynard crew as they were hitting the Chatam and Maynard intersection, specifically catch the VQ Maynard running Liverpool.

Nine set out, two a little quicker than the rest (respect to Large and Hi-Liter). The route was all the way down High House, right on Chatam, right on Maynard and a left on High House to get home.

But... Liverpool ran to dang fast, heck Franklin was cooking and ahead of us at the turn as well. We did intersect with a few Maynard bros including Wonderbread which made for solid fellowship on the way back.

Any who... 4.35 miles on the Vesper tracker on this day.

MIAGD,

Kitty
