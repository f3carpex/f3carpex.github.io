Pax of 5 met up for another Tuesday evening beatdown.  It was a nice evening at that, though a little warm.  We started off by running through the sections of the main parking lot, throwing in a little **karaoke** for good measure.

**Warm up**:

- **Good evening**
- **SSH**
- **Steve Erle**
- **Overhead, seal clap**
- **Calf stretch**
- **Plank Jacks**

**Thang 1**:

**4 Corners** around the parking lot with 10 reps of the following exercises in said corners:  **Carolina Dry Docks, American Hammers, Monkey Humpers, and Burpees**.  Then back to the starting point for some **Sumo Squats**.

**Thang 1A**:

**Repeato**, except in an escalator format.  At the first corner we did 10 **CDD’s**, next corner 10 **CDD’s** + 10 **Am. Hammers**, and so on.  Then **LBC’s** at the starting point.

**Thang 2**:

We ran up to the handrails along the pathway, got into the Australian pullup position, and made our way along the railing.  Doing 5 **Australian pullups** at every other section.

**Thang 3**:

Run down to the big (empty) fountain and partner up.  Partner 1 ran the pickle and **bear crawled** between two designated trash cans before coming back around.  Partner 2 stayed at the fountain doing **Irkins** AMRAP, then flapjack.  We repeated this routine with **Prisoner Squats**, **Dips**, and **WWII’s**.  We were almost done, but I realized you can’t have **Irkins** without **Derkins**.  Well, as Spit-Shine pointed out, you actually can, but it just wouldn’t feel complete…     Soo, we finished it out with **Derkins**…

**Mary**:

We moseyed over to our favorite mary spot with the small fountain for the following exercises:

- **\-Freddy Mercs**
- **\-Captain Thor (version of Jack Webb. 1 Sit up to 4 Am. Hammers, we did 5 rounds).**
- **\-Flutter Kicks**
- **\-Dying Cockaroach**
- **\-Homer to Marge**
- **\-LBC**
- **\-Box Cutter/Cox Butter**
- **\-100’s**
- **Then have a nice day with your feet in the fountain**.
