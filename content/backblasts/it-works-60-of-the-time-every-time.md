26 PAX gathered at the flag, with rumors of a mysterious FNG who was nowhere to be seen. First exercise, the Pledge of Allegiance.

### Warm Up

Mosey to the heart of Apex Community Park, the parking lot adjacent to the tennis courts. Along the way add in some butt kickers and karaoke. Circle up for a standard fare of SSHs, Good Mornings, Sir Fazio Arm Circles, Steve Earles, and Control Freak Merkins.

### The Thang

Double 11s down the hill and back up it. At the start, we complete 1 Peter Parker Merkin. At the top of the other hill, 10 Jump Squats. In the middle? A burpee ladder, ascending from 1-10 and then descending back 10 -1. At some point the mysterious FNG moseys in and joins us. YHC makes it up to 10 and back down to 6 before the clock beckons. Mosey back to the first parking lot.

### Mary

WWIIs, Dying Cockroaches and 10 FNG Welcome burpees OYO followed by Have a Nice Day.

### COT

3 Hates, 8 Respects, 16 Mehs. Welcome FNG Snooze!

Announcements: KKC, Open Out book tour!

Prayers/Praises: Ausfarht's continued recovery, Crimson's friend Dave struggling with family adjustments following the loss of his wife last fall, Imp's friend whose wife has been diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer.

YHC took us out.

### NMS

Disco Duck seemed to be expecting some good stuff here, so off we go!

There was a good discussion about whether penalty burpees should be called when an FNG is late. We were gonna do those burpees anyway, but YHC decided to label them Welcome Burpees. Total of 95 burpees this morning.

This workout received a "Top 3 Suck" rating from PAX who are prone to rate such things. With the EC run YHC tallied exactly 5 miles. Just short of 3 miles on the main event.

Thanks Cataracts for the theme image. A man of few words, but listen when he puts something out there.

Minor counting issues during the workout. The actual count doesn't matter as long as you're doing something. It is funny though.

I'm very intrigued by PAX who choose to run against the traffic. Biner and YHC decided that running on the left against your brothers probably represents some kind of mental disorder. ON YOUR RIGHT!

Thanks for the honor of leading you...make tomorrow just a bit better than today.
