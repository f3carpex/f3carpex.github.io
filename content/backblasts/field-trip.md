Field trip day at Carpex's premier Friday AO in the 27513 zip code.

Little chitty-chat among the PAX to start, "Holy shnikies it's windy. Is that a tail wind, Coney?"

A quick disclaimer to FNG Nick and we're headed out of the park and on the road towards the Veterans' Memorial, because YHC has a half a Mary coming up and needs some miles before a LONG run manana w/ @mabellcarpex. Plus, Large Mouth was here so...

**Along the run route (approx 1.2 miles) stop for:**

- **H**illbillies x10
- **E**rkins x10
- **L**BC x10
- **L**BC x10
- **O**ne Legged Burpees x10

**Thang 1: In a big circle at the memorial for:**

- 10 merkins, squats, lbc and step ups
- From 10... all the way down to 1

**Back on the run (approx 1.8 miles -- we took the trail back) and stop for:**

- **K**nerkins x10
- **I**mperial Walkers x10
- **T**ony Hawk Burpees x5
- **T**urkish Get Ups x5
- **Y**ou Betchas x10
- Oh, and you gotta bear crawl those bridges on the way back (thanks for suggesting the trail, @sabancarpex)
- Stop at the gratitude rock to give thanks for our families and the blessing of a new little one for the Puff family.

**Just enough time at the flag for:**

- Merkins x20
- Squats x20
- LBC x20 IC
- Quick Feet x20

**Announcements:**

- Long run tomorrow (11 miles) with Ma Bell at White Oak
- Mule on Saturday the 10th, check with Banjo for details.

**Prayers/Praises:**

- Jiggly Puffs 2.0 on the way
- Burt's BIL John and his treatment
- Pierogi's friend Terry and healing hands

**NMS:**

- YHC tooks us out -- may we be grateful today for the blessings of a new little life for brother Puff and his family. Each little one is a true blessing.
- Welcome FNG Flipper.
- Tclaps for the HIM who wore red today to Remember Everyone Deployed.
- Finally -- you guys missed (outside of Elf and Pierogi) the greatest 40 to the Flag episode that YOU'LL NEVER see. Camera malfunction -- pure gold!!!!
