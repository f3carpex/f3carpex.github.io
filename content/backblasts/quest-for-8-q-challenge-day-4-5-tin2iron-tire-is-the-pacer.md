PAX: Ausfahrt, Disco Duck, Hello Kitty, Intimidator, Pet Sounds, Ramsay, Reentry, Roasters, WWW

I arrived at the AO early to get prepped. Coffee started and equipment out. As it gets closer to time, I noticed two runners making their way to the AO (Hello Kitty and Ramsay). They wanted their mileage. Hello Kitty mentions that Pet Sounds was supposed to run in as well.

0530 on the clock and no Pet Sounds. We kick it into gear with the F3-ministravia (Core Values, Credo, and Mission). We Pledge our Allegiance to Old Glory and off we go at a walking pace. I directed those who wanted to run to run twice around the pickle.

Circle up for warm-up: GM (CF style), plank/runner's stretch/plank/CFMs/runner's stretch/plank/Eskimo merkins, Sir Fazios. As we are warming up, Pet Sounds comes strolling in. Better late than never. He had battery issues with his light and had to head back to this house to swap them out. Safety is always a priority.

Now the thang. The PAX noticed a few apparatuses set-up for their pleasure (pain pleasure that is).

QIC/YHC calls out the workout at each station (9).

Thang: 9 spots of gloriousness for 3 rounds

Tire flip which is the pacer

Battle rope

Heavy ball (15 lbs) overhead slams

Plank rows with paver blocks

Perfect merkin

Steve Earl for 2 rounds and then low slow flutter for 1

Side straddle hops for 2 rounds and then LBC

Curls with paver bricks

Jump squats

We pushed it until it was time for COT.

COR: 9 HIMs

NOR: Honor (1), Respect (2), mehs (6)

Announcements: Oakwood 24 and food drive

NMS: Tclaps for Reentry for #5 with me and #4 for Roasters.

6-man: Pet Sounds

Coffee is delicious when it is freshly brewed as you are working out.

Thank you HIMs for helping me with my Quest for 8. It is a blessing to be with you all in the gloom.

As I write this, I got word that a good friend and Brother tested positive for Covid and has to quarantine. Since I was exposed, I have to quarantine as well for the safety of the PAX. This ends my Quest for 8 Q Challenge. However, I just have to continue this quest in 2021. Challenging yourself to do tough stuff is invigorating and makes you feel alive.

Special thanks to Reentry and Roasters for following me through my quest. Thank you to the Brothers who made the choice to make it to my Qs. I'm honored and grateful for you all.
