The announcement and walkback on cargo restrictions last night definitely inspired the exercises today. I'm FOR SURE one to panic, so this has been a time where I've actively needed to stop. slow down. be calm. make a smart decision. with marginal success.

3rd out of the last 4 Qs where it's pretty much run to a remote location and make it back late. This was the closest of the 3, but that's still squarely on me to get us back! The heatmap will be filled up soon enough to break me of this habit. We made up for it with a 3 minute COT, so that left ample time for Bagel-teria. Don't care what everyone else thinks, this one is the best around. It's early, it's bagels, it's legit.

MIAGD!
