The Interwebs are full of "ruck 101" posts.. why start another one?

Great question. The answer probably lies somewhere between hubris and helpfulness. You be the judge. Anyway, here are my thoughts.

### First.. Why?

Why in the world should I do one of these? It sounds awful. 12 hours of being beat-down? No thanks.

It's not about that. It's about you, contributing to your team. It's about the people to your left and right. THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU. Sound familiar?

Watch the video above and you'll get some sense of it. Sign up and you'll understand. You can do it. Your team will help. That's all the "why" you need. On to the "how."

The other part of the answer is that you don't need to go all the way to a Tough (or beyond) to enjoy rucking. Rucking is simply putting some weight on your back and moving. If you hate running, you'll love rucking. If you like running, you'll like rucking.

If you want a TL;DR on gear, check outÂ [ADR's gear list](https://alldayruckoff.com/training/what-you-need-to-start-rucking/), and also see [How to Ruck on a Budget](https://web.archive.org/web/20200218021616/http://www.mettleforger.com/how-to-ruck-on-a-budget/).

### Rucks

[GORUCK bags](https://www.goruck.com/collections/rucking-gear) are fantastic, if a bit pricey. You get what you pay for; they are made in the USA (again), by a veteran-owned company, and if you shred your ruck, send it in and they'll repair or replace it. I'm told if your GORUCK bag fails during a GORUCK event, the Cadre has to give you his. That's pretty sweet, and it means they hold value well if you ever want to unload it. GORUCK runs sales on major holidays, and sometimes does Christmas in July. Ask your local rucker, they've probably got a 10% (or 25%) off coupon code. Vets, first responders, and teachers all get discounts.

GORUCK makes [the Rucker](https://www.goruck.com/collections/rucker), a bag designed for events and training. It's got an inner sleeve for a ruck plate, hydration bladder loop built-in, and is sized right for what it does. I love mine, and have used both the 20L version which should be enough space, and the 25L version which allows you to pack a little bit extra, even if you shouldn't.

They also make the GR1, in two sizes: 21L for PAX < 6' tall, 26L for those taller. The GR1 is the [baddest laptop bag in the business](https://blog.goruck.com/news/gr1-baghdad-meets-nyc-the-story/). If you want a bag you can use for every-day laptop carry and the occasional event, it's hard to go wrong. I don't use my GR1 for training or events, as I prefer keeping it clean and not having to empty out all my work stuff every time I want to ruck. Which is often.

All of that said, you can do an event with anything that'll survive for 12+ hours. I'm a fan of the [5.11 Rush24](https://smile.amazon.com/5-11-Tactical-Rush-Backpack-Sandstone/dp/B004D1WK46/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1490108889&sr=8-1&keywords=rush24) and [Rush12](https://smile.amazon.com/5-11-Tactical-Rush-Backpack-Black/dp/B003HHV0QQ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1490108889&sr=8-2&keywords=rush24). I did my first event with a Rush24, which was a bit big. The Rush12 is probably the right size for training and a Tough. [This bag on Amazon](http://amzn.to/1LQLbEL) gets a thumbs-up from Mettle Forger, who knew his stuff better than anyone. At $40-60 it's worth a shot. Amazon is awash in cheap (and inexpensive?) ruck options these days.

I have to give a shout to [Condor packs](https://smile.amazon.com/Condor-Medium-Assault-Pack-Black/dp/B007V98I7U), as some of the Churham PAX are big fans. $60 for a ruck that some tough dudes give a thumbs-up to? Why not!

No matter what bag you get, you'll want a waist strap. Bear crawls with 30 pounds of weight hitting you in the back of the head are no fun. Padded, not padded, GORUCK, Condor, no-name Amazon.. figure out what works for you.

### Weights

Ruck plates are sexy. They keep the weight close to your back and can allow you to move it up higher. A no-frills 30-pound hunk of steel will cost about $45 when ordered ~6 at a time if you can find a fabricator (see below). The [GORUCK plates](http://www.goruck.com/ruck-plates/c/103) are great with the dual handles and make good coupons in general. [SHplates are works of art](https://coyotepittsburgh.wixsite.com/shplates). The [Titan Fitness](https://www.titan.fitness/30-lb-ruck-weight.html) plates are popular now too if they fit in your ruck - hard to beat a $45 price point shipped. See t[his comprehensive article at ADR](https://alldayruckoff.com/articles/titan-fitness-ruck-weights-in-the-goruck-rucker-1-0-and-2-0/) for a comparison on how they all fit in a Rucker v1 or v2.

I've had a metal shop make no-frills plates for me. Find a local branch of Metal Supermarkets or similar, get at least 5 of you together and ask for:

- Hot rolled bar stock, 8" x 0.750", cut to length 11.75 - this is 20 pounds
- Hot rolled bar stock, 8" x 0.375", cut to length 11.75 - this is 10 pounds.

It helps to get a metal grinder and take the rough edges off. Then you can wrap these two together to get 30#, or keep an extra 20 in and use it to overtrain.

You can also get some barbell plates at Play It Again or Academy and rig something up in a pinch. I saw a guy show up at an event and use boxes of 9x19 as weight. Maybe not the best plan, but illustrates that you can get creative.

I used to talk about bricks, but that's now so old-school as to be forgotten history. Stick with plates.

### Shoes

"What shoes should I wear" is a common enough question that it points out the obvious -- whatever works for you. Running shoes are fine. You may want something like a Hoka or Hurricane or Kayano with plenty of cushion. I wanted something with more ankle support for events, so I'm in a Merrell Moab Ventilator Mid \[update: I was.. now I'm in a similar Vasque boot that doesn't make my little toe numb\]. Get something that drains well. GORE-TEX is great for everything except being submerged. Which you will be. Don't go for waterproof; go for fast draining. The GORUCK MACV-1s are popular.

### Socks

Cotton = bad. Wool = good. Smartwool, Darn Tough, Injinji, DryMax are all commonly cited. Compression socks or calf sleeves might not be a bad idea. I like [wool Injinji's](https://smile.amazon.com/Injinji-Outdoor-Midweight-Nuwwol-Charcoal/dp/B00IT8SLX8/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1490106422&sr=8-7&keywords=injinji%2Bwool&th=1&psc=1) or DryMax and then calf sleeves.

If you start rucking enough, you'll want to read [Fixing Your Feet](http://www.fixingyourfeet.com/), or check out Jonathan Savage's pages on [taping](http://fellrnr.com/wiki/Taping) and [blister prevention](http://fellrnr.com/wiki/Blister_Prevention). Callouses are not good things! They are early signs of problems. Blisters are late signs. Try to fix the underlying shoe/sock fit issues and avoid getting a blister in the first place.

### Clothes

Don't overthink it. I like long pants for the Tough. Mine are [Tru-Spec](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003U5HOPG/), I've also used [Vertx](https://smile.amazon.com/Vertx-Phantom-Tactical-Pants-Smoke/dp/B00D4DFSO8/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1490132586&sr=8-2&keywords=vertx+pants). They are tough and dry pretty well. You don't need to spend $120 on the [Triple Aught](http://store.tripleaughtdesign.com/Force-10-AC-Cargo-Pant) or the [GORUCK Challenge pants,](https://www.goruck.com/collections/mens-apparel) but you could. As with socks, synthetics or merino are a better idea than cotton everywhere.

Layers are good otherwise. It could end up being much colder than you think. Especially if you're wet. A windbreaker is required if the overnight temp will be under 60F.

I like to keep an extra shirt of each type (long/short sleeve) in my dry bag, unless one or the other is clearly superfluous.

### Other Gear

Dry bag. Get one. The [ones with the one-way air expulsion](https://www.amazon.com/Sea-Summit-eVAC-Dry-Sack/dp/B001PR070A) are nice. Put your extra clothes, windbreaker, keys in it. Ziploc's work too but I find this more convenient.

Get some [reflective bands](https://smile.amazon.com/Reflective-Band-Genuine-Reflexite-Jogalite/dp/B000KG6JB8/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1490109117&sr=8-7&keywords=reflective+bands). Required. A hydration bladder too. The Source ones are great; you can pay more for the FDE version GORUCK and others sell or [get this one on Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/Source-Outdoor-Hydration-Reservoir-Transparent/dp/B004QMCB78/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1490108988&sr=8-4&keywords=source+3l). I see plenty of Camelbak's too. Get something you KNOW will last. If your bladder bursts mid-event, you're going to have a bad (and unsafe) time. Enough that a 1L Nalgene has been added to the packing list.

Fact: you can't finish a GORUCK event without a carabiner on your ruck. Well.. maybe you can. But what's the harm?

Having 12' of tubular nylon webbing in your ruck may come in handy. Never know what you're going to want to rig up. I've used a runner or length of webbing in every event I've participated in.

### Training

Check out [www.pathfinderrucktraining.com](http://www.pathfinderrucktraining.com) for a great program run by Dora out of Charlotte. If you miss the sign-up window you can still see the standards and do some DIY challenges. You don't get a cool patch unless you sign up. At the end of the day, it is all about the patches.

Locally, The Crick does a ruck at 0615 on Saturday. Phoenix has been doing EC regularly as well. Rolling Stone exists as a weekly ruck workout, rotating to different AOs in Carpex every now and then. Join the Slack #rucking channel for updates on other ruck events that spring up irregularly.

### NMS

This ended up being a way longer post than I intended. I'm not sure I actually saved anyone any time.. oh well. Enjoy it nonetheless.
