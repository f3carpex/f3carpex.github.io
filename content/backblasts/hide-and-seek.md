Today's Q was in doubt when I jammed up my ankle at #2F-Guys-and-Balls yesterday. But all I did was make the PAX run while I stayed central for the workout. The HIMs were understanding and didn't rag on me too bad about that...they focused on my sexy new silkies instead. Since I wasn't hiding any part of my legs in those silkies (totally a photo of me as featured photo), I decided we'd play hide and seek for our workout instead. Hopefully the PAX got enough running in, as the focus was on building strength instead of building gazelles!

Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome. -Booker T. Washington

We enjoyed some beers in the Gloom discussing current events like the conflicts in the Middle East (current situation in Israel and my own deployment to the area). Great time with some great men. Loom had some fantastic mangoes for us, and we learned that there are like 500 different types of mangoes around the world!
