Nicely put, Pickles. More on that in a minute.

As for any Q YHC rolls in about 15 minutes before the start to walk the grounds. (This was not as necessary today as I had been there the afternoon before with my 2.0 and 2.1 to scout and confirm a few things. North Cary Park is truly the nicest park in Cary.) Shortly behind me the Site Q runs in carrying the shovel flag. Some new found EC not doubt. Perhaps it's the ECSFR, Extra Credit Shovel Flag Run. So many forms for EC nowadays. Hard to keep up with them. But I digress. Site Q, Pierogi, knocks out a few ECP and follows to inform me that his workout was over but he'd be back for the flag. Dad duties call. More PAX roll in to replace said Site Q. 12 in all. Good number for what's in store.

With no FNGs we proceed with the Pledge.

"Remember this route", YHC calls out and we begin our warm up mosey down around the pickle, up on to the soccer field, around the perimeter of the field, back down to pickle and onto the basketball court to circle up for warm up.

Warm up: 10-20 repetitions of: Mountain Climbers, Bat Wings, Steve Earle, Good Mornings, Fluttering Supermans

We position ourselves back onto the pickle and partner up for thang 1.

Thang 1: Vacuum Cleaners. I'd encourage you to look it up in the exicon and then call it sometime in the near future. It really sucks. There was some yelling and shouting but nearly all the pax gave a brave go at it.

Thang 2: 4 Man Indian Race: Remember the warmup route? That is now our race course. 3 groups of 4 men Indian run as fast as they can while still sucking wind from Thang 1! Great effort by all.

10 count by Leprechaun and then on to the playground for thang 3.

Thang 3: DORA - 50 Burpos, 100 Pull-ups, 150 Dirkens, 200 J-lo. Partner 2 runs down to volleyball pit out the back on to the path and back to the playground.

Ran out of time but was very excited about Thang 4. Gonna save that one for next time.

COT: Count-a-rama, Name-a-rama

Prayers: Federal employees, Arsenal's friend who is in a coma.

NMS: Thankful for the opportunity to lead men again! YHC is in the best all-round shape of my life and I owe it all to the men who come out to the gloom on a consistent basis and remind me that today does not have to look like yesterday. Together we are growing stronger mentally, physically, spiritually and it is permeating into every facet of our lives.
