Out route looked like a sun which reminded me of what my pastor and the song below say: Get over the Sun! King Solomon had it all and searched for satisfaction under the sun but it could not be found.  We need something bigger and better which can only be found in Christ Jesus.

"Sitting around the fireplace With a friend who's been through it all Solomon, wisest one, tell me what you have found Under the sun, under the sun He answered, "Get over Get over, get over the sun Get over, get over, get over the sun Where life is hidden" And then he put on a somber face Talked about how the rich man will waste Away in the ground where the poor man is found Painted up like a clown under the sun, under the sun He answered, "Get over Get over, get over the sun Get over, get over, get over the sun" Soon you'll be done A life spent on some shiny God Who leaves you empty Get over, get over, get over the sun Get over, get over, get over the sun"
