_Despite tools made to crumble cement, a group of men wearing odd sweatbands who descended upon poor, fair POGL failed to break a single window. Although passersby described the group as "sweaty" and "out-of-breath," no demolition dust or other typical signs of modern-day peaceful protests were observed. Chants included reciting the (American) pledge and closing in prayer. No posters observed, but many bumper stickers with an F3 logo have given reporters a hot lead to follow. What follows is a minute account of their activities, for our concerned and captive readers..._

Low 70's, fairly humid, clear morning at the site of DTP. 7 pax, no FNGs, but one guy's first time at a mace workout so welcome to the cult-within-a-cult, Bumper Sticker.

## Warmup

Mosey with your mace around the block, then back to the COC parking lot for:

- Arm curl rolls with mace, IC x10
- Overhead press standing hold, 10-count
- Standing twist side to side, IC x10
- Slo-mo rock your body, IC 8-count x8
- Slowly stretch down into downwards dog and walk, IC x5-ish
- Standing one-arm extensions, not sure if they have a fancier name, x10

Mosey to the front of the Baptist church lot, and repeato with the weight of the mace on the other side.

## Thang 1: Merkin burnout

Mosey to the park, in case we're in need of a kinder, gentler surface for the merkin challenge.

- 5 regular merkins
- 5 plank mace merkins
- 5 regular merkins
- 5 rock mace merkins
- 5 wide / diamond / plank mace merkins

Pause for varying short counts, sub 10.

Repeato x3 for a total of 75 merkins.

## Thang 2: Leg circuit

Mosey to the swimming pool lot.

Do them all with the weight on the same side in cadence.

- Overhand grip: Squat into overhead press
- Overhand grip: Hinge ball side down, uppercut into battle lunge on opposite leg, back to standing.
- One-legged deadlift
- Side lunge, mace down along the straight, non-lunging leg. Step up into one-legged knee raise while flipping mace head. Back to standing.
- 360 into reverse lunge. _Note: Per my very thorough research, a halo is when you hold the ball whereas a 360 is when you hold the handle._

Mosey up the hill, stopping at the side road in the cemetery and repeato on other side. No gravediggers were executed out of respect.

## Thang 3: Arm circuit

Mosey up the hill to the back lot by the side alley.

- One-armed overhead press, single count x10ish
- Uppercuts: Overhand grip, uppercut with hand not on ball, then uppercut with ball, center, repeat, IC x15ish
- One-armed tricep extensions, single count x10ish
- One-armed curls, single count x15ish
- One-armed back rows, single count x10ish

Mosey to back lot of the Baptist church and repeato other arm.

## Mary

- No time, so run tall and suck in your abs.
- AYG alley with about 40s left. A bit harder when you have a mace.

## COT

**Announcements**: The months of September and October no longer belong to you. You're welcome for F3's leadership.

**Prayers & praises**: Praises for returning students and returning travllers. Prayers for Free Bird and healing.

**2nd F**: Tclaps to Wahoo for coffee.

**NMS**:

- Merkin challenge sucks slightly less with a group of guys pushing you.
- Mace mileage records are a new thing for the popup; no one tell Hi-Liter.
- Carpex coffeeteria has basically become YHC's source of news, as I hadn't even heard of the latest child tax credits and Washington happenings. I appreciate these moments to catch up and share what's going on with everyone. You can learn a lot about a lot of topics (some trivial and some not) but it's always a great way to start the day.
