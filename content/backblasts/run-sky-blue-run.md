16 PAX gathered on this balmy Tuesday morning for what some likely hoped would be a jog in the park.  Indeed, just as YHC was about to ring the bell, up jogged Sky Blue, fresh off a two mile run in.  This admittedly got YHC thinking, should he go with his well crafted, planned to the T workout? Or should he call an audible to help make sure Sky Blue got all the running he could handle.  Audible it is.

Warmup: Half mile run, bear crawl, standard Merkins, SSH, MCs, FMs

Thang: Full field 11s with burpees and Merkins, 4 full field sprints with recovery on the jog and gorilla walk, standard merkin, jog back to shovel flag for LBCs, FMs, and have a nice day.

Prayers go up to Joe (Parker's dad) and Mark (Hi-liter's dad) as they battle, and for Van Winkle (Kilmer's 2.0) as he gets ready to interview for a new job.

PAX: Biner, Katniss, PBX, Sky Blue, Lulu, Bones, Parker, Hi-liter, Kilmer, Brosef, Sour Mash, Compound W, Swag, Wanna Cry, McCants (QIC, YHC)

NMS: 2.63 miles of pure #ISI.  And apparently I drive a girly car.  At least that's what your wife says.  And if you need Franklin, check the coffee houses of Amsterdam.
