Naked Man Moleskin: It was a pleasure leading these fine gentlemen today. It made my day to get the workout going and I was driven by all the energy of the group. Impressed with all the PAX. Banjo killed the pain clock. I was about 2 hours behind.

Prayed for people in Hurricane path and to be a positive influence on people. Some day you're the bright spot for others around you, stay positive and look for the best. See you in the gloom.
