Welcome FNG Clementine, brought by Trike

Thanks Franklin for pointing out the cones blocking the clockwise route. Early audible to counterclockwise.

You would think SSH would be performed in a fairly consistent manner, but we seem to have 3 or 4 versions in Carpex.

Did everyone notice Shut-In hitting the water fountain at the 30-minute mark?

Great to see some new PAX as well as some familiar faces that I have not run across in a while.

YHC extremely grateful for the sequence of events that led me to F3. It was exactly what I needed. An hour at the Y a few days a week was generally keeping me fit, but it wasn’t doing anything else. After 3 years, I feel like my F3 growth journey still has a long way to go, and I just hope my body holds out. If not, I look forward to the many 2nd and 3rd F opportunities that exist.
