At the time of this Q, I still thought Social Distance was the length you went to to post and Q outside your comfort zone - to meet and greet some new PAX. My how times change... At the helm of BH today and a decent group kept swelling with late arrivals. However, most PAX were tapering or bruising, so we were left with only 7 for the ME. And my lazy, isolated, kid-watching self is simply dropping the weinke on you. I couldn't possible remember the random workout that Dice-capades generated anyway. Except that 1-4 rolled an inordinate amount of 2x Burpees
