The grumblechatter was strong at Wolverine this morning, led by Her-'I can't get wet'-mes and Frank-'a mosey can't last longer than 0.4 miles'-lin. But we persisted. And YHC is grateful to get to improve.

**Warm-up:  
**Jog (or was it a mosey)? over to the school lot  
Good Mornings; Imperial Walker; Hill Billy; Calf-stretch w/ Merkins; Butt Kicker; High Knees; Karaoke

**Thang 1:**  
Groups of three for new-max pull-ups. First time through, set your baseline max. Second time through, partner-assist makes it +1. Third partner does squats. Repeato.  
Lunge walk + windsprint for groups not on the bar.

**Transition:**  
Interval runs back to the soccer fields

**Thang 2:**  
Four 'not-a-rectangle' corners:  
10 Burpees  
20 Lunges  
Crab-walk -> Crawl Bear -> Reverse Crabwalk -> Bear Crawl the mini hill  
25 Freddy Mercs in Cadence  
3 times round the quadrilateral.

**COT**:  
Praises for caroling and sharing Christmas cheer. Prayers for Magoo downrange.

Build-a-bear and Banjo joined an almost full-house for Coffeeteria.
