February, sixty degrees, light rain, light wind, glorious conditions for a downtown Apex beatdown.

**Warm-Up** Mosey across the tracks and over to the Apex United Methodist Church courtyard and circle up for hillbillies, Sir Fazios, cherry pickers and copperhead squats.

**The Thang** 15 Carolina dry docks, 15 monkey humpers, 15 LBCs, take an abbreviated lap around the church, repeato dropping the count by one each round.

Mosey back across the tracks to the front of Apex Baptist Church and count of into 1s and 2s. 1s BTTW while 2s knock out 20 merkins, then flip flop. Repeato with peoples chair and squats, and BTTW and dying cock-a-roaches.

Lap around the lot.

Repeato with 15, lap around the lot.

One more round of 20 with BTTW and merkins, then head back to the flag.

**Mary** Box cutters, Homer-to-Marge, Freddie Mercs, Have A Nice Day.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  17 **Name-a-rama**:  1 RESPECT, 16 meh, 0 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers Ellie from down around F3 Cherokee, who passed away recently, lifting up all who love and miss her, prayers for Pierogi's friend Jacob who lost his mentor recently, and prayers for all our brothers who are struggling with injury and illness **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**  

Great to see Kenny back in the gloom, and wearing his red hooded sweatshirt taboot!

During the first thang one smart pax moved to a covered area to stay dry, and everyone else followed. I felt obligated to throw in some penalty burpees. I thought Hi-Liter would be happy, but he complained that they weren't hand release burpees. It's like spending months picking out your M's birthday gift, and when she opens it she asks if you kept the receipt.

Thang 2 was a bit of a cluster Q. Hello Kitty called sumo squats where you stomp your foot and slap your knee. It was a bit too complicated for most of us, we're gonna need some supplemental training.

It was another great day in the gloom for YHC. It seems every time I post it's with a few vets that I've known for a long time, a few guys who have been around for a year or two who totally get what F3 is all about, and a few newer guys that I enjoy getting to know. I appreciate all you guys coming out and starting the day with me.
