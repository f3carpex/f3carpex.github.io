GT has few expectations. Those they do have include:

- 5K minimum
- No 10-counts
- Make sure Largemouth at least breaks a sweat

Apparently recently a new one was added:

- Tell jokes

They didn't say they were funny. So I repeated by bacon tree joke from #PointBreak. Luckily there were no repeats from earlier in the week and I got a bit better on my delivery.

**Warm-up:**

Run to the gazebo at the roundabout.

25 IC SSH, 10 IC IW, 15 IC MW, some merkins.

Some complained that the warm up cooled them down by the time they got to the gazebo.

**Thang:**

Head north on Clearport towards Davis. Start with one HHM on the first driveway (right hand side of the street only). Add one HHM at each driveway. By the time we got to ~15 HHM, form was pretty bad. Finished with CDDs instead.

Head west on Morrisville Pkwy towards Loius Stephens. Start with one StarJump at the first light pole. Add one more Star Jump at each lightpole. I think we ended with 24.

Head south on Louis Stephens back to the school. Start with one burpee at the first light pole. Add one at each new light pole. Got to ~9 burpees but it's getting late so we finished with five at each light pole.

Got back right on time. 3.18 miles. On the nose.

Boom

**COT**: Prayers for Tang and RED.

**NMS:**

Shared by tire rolling joke after COT. Don't know if that counts.

Four or five for coffee.

Amazing sunrise this morning.
