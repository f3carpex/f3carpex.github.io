Friday mornings are made for Danger Zone, the original Cary AO.

73 degrees, humid, slightly overcast.

Nice crowd this morning which formed while I placed the cones on the soccer field. 24 dudes, inlcuding one FNG (more on that later), PigPen and his 2.0...7 year old Boom from Raleigh and Big Bird, Viking and Puck also from Raleigh.     One current site Q and two old site Q's on hand.

Caught up PigPen and Boom at the Forge this week when I hung with Chinese Downhill, Half, BigBird, Viking and Puck...promoted CarPex (however not like Hello Kitty and Shut In) and they made the trip to DZ.

BTW:  Boom policed the cursing this am and busted both YHC and Big Bird.   The words were He11 and Sh1t.    No penalty Burbees.

Term Pappy was in the house fresh off the birth of his first grand baby!   Congrats TP.

Flip was a great straight man for me today and I enjoyed all of the chatter from the dudes.

Disclaimer made to FNG (Gastonia boy and guest of TP) and F3 CarPex's timekeeper Saban started the clock.

Off we go.

Warm up Run around the pickle, butt kickers, high knees. Circle up. plank jacks, SSH, Hill Billy's, cotton pickers, 10 burbees OYO

Hill 7s in the lot.   2 groups.   Start at bottom of the lot and run to the top (almost). Hand release merkins and star jumps are the moves.

Circle up to finish the warm up for Flip Flop.  SSH, King david kicks, IW,  little baby JJ's, 10 burbees OYO

Head to the field 50% run to the end of the field noting the placement of the cones. OYG back

6 's: 6 stops not the field, 6 reps of the same move at each stop.   Out and back. Squats, Merkins, Burpees are the moves.   I struggled with the explanation.

Circle up in the field for some interim Mary. Low slow flutters, then Freddy Merks, then a little chatter from Flip Flop.  Abort.   Now for the..... Jack Webb: with merkins 5x hallelujahs

Back to the pickle

Circle up: low slow flutters, Freddy Mercury, American hammer (called by Biner), monkey humpers (called by Boom)

That's it.

COT

Count a Rama:   24 dudes. Name a Rama:   6 respects, 4 hates (including young Boom) and 14 "others"

FNG ended the name a rama by stating Hospital Name, Age, and then "gaslight".    Not as cool a move as Dice, but in any event we moved on to a naming session and settled on Side Salad.   This name has been on the shelf for a bit and now has a owner.     SS will be back!   Will he be a heavy user of group me?

See the news channel or F3 CarPEX for news

Prayers.

YHC took us out

Make it a great day Men!   My day is always better when I start it with my F3 Pals.
