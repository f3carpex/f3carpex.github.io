YHC had wanted to Q his home site at some point in the next few weeks. After 15 miles at Oakwood 24 over the weekend I was only 4 miles short of 1000 miles for the year. I didn't want to leave it to chance so I jumped on the Q sheet to make sure I got enough mileage to hit 1k. Well, it's Christmas week so why not pull back out last year's FMJ 12 Days of Christmas. I tweaked it a little bit but for the most part, decided to run it back. A little EC run to just get things started. Get back to the flag with a couple minutes to spare and here we go:

**Warmup**: 5 Pax plus YHC at 0530, no FNGs, quick disclaimer and the pledge and off we go. Mosey around the pickle and circle up for:  
SSH x 15 IC  
Good Mornings x 5 IC  
Sir Fazio Arm Circles x 10 IC  
Seal Claps x 10 IC  
Imperial Walkers x 10 IC  
Plank Jacks x 10 IC  
Calf Stretch L/R x 10 silent count each side

**The Thang:** Mosey to the far pickle for the 12 Days of Schlitzmas (I just realized I spelled my own name wrong on the dry erase board) Start at day 1 then run the pickle. Upon return, perform day 2 then 1 and then run the pickle again. Continue in that fashion to 12 days. We finished right on time so no Mary.

**COT:** 6 Pax. Announcements- Duck Donuts Dash, Feb. 6. Prayers/Praises- Prayers for all that are travelling over this holiday season. Be safe and healthy travelling as well as being outside of your bubble and around others. Prayers if difficult decisions need to be made. Prayers/Praises as YHC completes his 26th Q this year, putting me right where I wanted to be at one every 2 weeks and owe that to the Carpex challenge. YHC and the M started dating 7 years ago on this day. And finally, for reaching 1000 miles this year. I wasn't sure I was going to make it and there's no way I could have without F3. Thank you everyone.
