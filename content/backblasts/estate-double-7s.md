**Warm up**

SSH, HB, GM, Merkins, Plank Jacks

**Thang 1**

Run to the Ederlee Hill and 2 push ups ladder at each light pole to the top of the hill. Then run over to  Regency Estates.  (I hope they don't have a google alert on their name.  All we are doing is running I swear!)

**Thang 2**

Partner up for 7s up the back hill by the lit-up house.  Partner clap merkins and bropees.

 

**Thang 3**

Run back up to the entrance for 7s near the top of the hill.  Backwards run to the top with swiss merkins and tuck jumps.

 

Run back to the parking lot for LBCs and dying cockroaches.

**COT** 13 and YHC took us out in prayer.

- Shut In - I did the back blast just a little late and McCants style.
- We missed you Flouride and maybe you needed the extra sleep.
- Hermes wasn't always the 6.
- Water Wings is a good partner.
- Thanks to everyone that came!  I appreciate the opportunity to lead.
- 3.85 miles - Not a record but we were back on time.
- Verse of the day for me: Lamentations 3:22-23

22 The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases;     his mercies never come to an end; 23 they are new every morning;     great is your faithfulness.
