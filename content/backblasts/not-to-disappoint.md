I get a little anxious when it comes to Qing "High Tempo" workouts. Will I get enough miles in? There's a certain group of Pax among us that expect a certain mileage minimum for such workouts. But will there be enough variety for the rest of the Pax? Well, I attempted to come up with a plan that would appease all, but wouldn't you know it, at 0530 that certain group was nowhere to be found anyway. Oh well, here goes nothing! YHC arrived early for a little EC check of the planned mileage and I think we can make it work.

**Warmup**: No FNGs. No matching socks. Mission statement delivered and pledge recited and we were off towards the middle school. Around the back of the school to the basketball court which BAB states he's never been to. You're welcome. Circle up on the court for:  
SSH x 15 IC  
Good Mornings x 5 IC  
Sir Fazio Arm Circles x 10 IC  
Seal Claps x 10 IC  
Imperial Walkers x 10 IC  
Plank Jacks x 10 IC  
Calf Stretch L/R x 10 silent count each side

**The Thang:** Mosey back up past the elementary school to Old Jenks and down the sidewalk back towards the flag. We find a well lit area for:  
Star Jumps, Steve Earles, Merkins, Plank Jacks and LBCs x 5 (mostly) IC  
Mosey the same route we did to start going behind the Middle School (skipping the basketball court) back for more exercises. Same exercises, increasing to 10 reps this times. Repeato with 15 reps. Some folks were able to get started on 20 reps, but we were out of time and recovered to the flag. Runner's stretch and Pigeon Stretch L/R followed by HAND.

**Announcements**: Blood drive 9/19. The Odyssey 10/24.

YHC took us out.

**NMS**: Admittedly not YHCs most creative Q, but we certainly met the mileage requirement and apparently it was good enough to earn a Qzie, so I'll take it! Thanks to everyone that showed up. It's always an honor to lead you men. MIAGD!
