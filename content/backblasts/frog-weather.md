Last night the forecast called for Duck Weather: 50 degrees, 100% chance of rain, and 10+ mph winds. Sadly when YHC arrived Carpex's newest Wednesday AO, it was Frog Weather: no rain and no winds, just a bunch of puddles.

**Warm-Up** Mosey through the shopping center to a side lot and circle up for imperial walkers, cherry pickers, Sir Fazios, copperhead squats and copperhead merkins. Then Crimson led us in the longest one count Good Morning ever.

**The Thang** Mosey over to stairs next to the fountain/playground area for 22's, monkey humpers at the top, Carolina dry docks at the bottom.

Mosey around the playground, avoiding the giant bullfrog who was not at all concerned about being crushed, to the planters in front of the playground and partner up for a modified Dora. 200 derkins, 200 dips, 200 step-ups, while your partner runs the loop around the playground.

Mosey over to the stairs on the other side of the fountain/playground area for 22's, Supermans at the top, LBCs at the bottom.

**Mary** Having avoided getting too wet so far, Mary took place in the dry spots at the bottom of the stairs. Freddie Mercs, Homer-to-Marge, American hammers, dying cock-a-roaches, box cutters and cox butters.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  10 **Name-a-rama**:  1 RESPECT, 9meh, 0 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for Crimson as he takes on a new role at work, prayers for all our brothers who are dealing with illness and injury and aren't able to post, reach out to them and offer some encouragement **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**  Point Break is a fantastic site. So much to do and we barely scratched the surface today. Having coffeeteria/Escalator at the Chicken-fil-a right next door kicks it up another notch. Five Stars, will be back.

YHC was worried about that frog. It was big enough that if anyone stepped on it they'd probably sprain their ankle, and might not even kill the frog.

I'm very grateful to start my mornings with you High Impact Men. We touched on this during our post-workout discussion, it's so much easier to do the right thing when you're surrounded by other men also trying to do the right thing. Thank you for the positive influence you have had on me.

Make it a great day!
