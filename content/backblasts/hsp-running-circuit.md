Nice temperature break in the mid-40s for 20 PAX at Hunter Street Park today. Lots to do in the park and throughout downtown Apex at this AO, but the half-mile loop around the athletic fields is a must-do. Here's how we made use of it.

**Warm-Up**

- Short jog to parking lot and circle up
- 20 SSH, IC
- 15 Hillbillies, IC
- 20 MCs, IC
- 20 Wide-grip Merkins
- 10 Windmills

**Circuit**

Run counter-clockwise around 0.5-mile path with 3 pain station stops:

1. Behind right field fence: 25 star jumps, 25 death squats against the fence
2. Near shelter: 25 dying cockroaches, 25 LBCs
3. At skate park: 25 dips, 25 derkins

Upon return to parking lot, duck walk first half of the lot and bear crawl the second half before starting next loop

All PAX completed at least 2+ loops

**Dessert**

- Mosey back to flag and do the following until all in:
    - 20 little man JJs, IC
    - 20 frog jumps
- Line up on road and do the following:
    - Run the first light post
    - 10 burpees, 10 HR Merkins, 10 Jump Squats
    - Backwards run back to start
    - Repeato 2 more times, running a little further and decreasing exercise count by one each time
