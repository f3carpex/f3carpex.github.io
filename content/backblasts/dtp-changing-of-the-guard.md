AO: Disturbing the Peace

Q: YHC

Even with the haze of pollen in the air, it was perfect weather in the gloom so the numbers remained high at the best AO in all of Carpex. YHC studied and recited the F3 Mission for hours prior to the post so it rolled off the tongue effortlessly to kickoff the workout, next we did the pledge of allegiance and off we went.

Mosey from the flag to the Methodist Church for the Warm-Up

**Warm Up:**

SSH x 15

Good Mornings

Sir Fazio

Sir Fazio Reverse

Seal Claps for Wahoo

Overhead Clap

Grundle Dusting

Calf Stretch

**Thang #1:**

Classic Dora: Partner 1 moseys around the Church while Partner 2 starts the count for 100 Merkins, 200 LBCs, 300 Squats

At the completion of Thang #1 YHC led the Pax in the wrong direction for half of a block before 16 Steves righted the ship so we could make our way to the bottom of Cemetery Hill for Thang #2.

**Thang #2:**

Jacob's Ladder: PAX started at the bottom of the hill and made our way to the first turn for Burpees the back down to the bottom, repeato increasing by 1 Burpee each round up to 7.

We made the 1/2 mile mosey back to the flag for 2 minutes of Mary:

**Mary:**

Homer to Marge, World War IIs, Have a nice day.

**COT:**

28 Pax with a few Respects and whole bunch of Mehs

Announcements: Transfer of Site Q duties from Hamm and Short Circuit to Rock Lobster and YHC; Hill Challenge soft launch on 4/15

Prayers/Praises: Prayers for Yahoo for next steps in adoption, prayers for Trackstar's boss' mother

Open Concept led the PAX in prayer.
