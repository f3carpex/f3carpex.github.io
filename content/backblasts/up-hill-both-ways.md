**Pre-Blast**

- 13 at #ao-fri-gt / Rolling Stone on a glorious morning in NW Cary. One thing led to another...and we ended up at Starbucks for #Coffeteria - the BEST #Coffeteria north of Biscuitville (thx, @Pivot).

**The Warmup**

- Pledge of Allegiance at the flag.
- Run to the cutout across from Heritage Pine Rd.

**The Thang**

- Cross the street.
- Suicide Sevens - between Louis Stevens and Green Level are seven intersections. Run from Louis Stevens to each successive intersection and back. Perform seven SSH at each intersection and seven WWM at the Louis Stevens.
