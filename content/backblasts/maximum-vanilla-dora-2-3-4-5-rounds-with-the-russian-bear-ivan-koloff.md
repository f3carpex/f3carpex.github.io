QIC: WWW

AO: Phoenix

PAX: Callahan, FNG Carvana, Clementine, Freebird, O’Douls, One-Four, PBX, Pigeon, Quiver, **Smokey**, Snots, The Commish, Triple Lindy, Wreck-it-Ralph (visiting from F3 Summerville),**WWW**, **Yogi**.

The weather and temperature was beautiful!  A great day to Q; however, when is it not a great day to Q in F3.  FYI – my resolution for this year is to Q atleast once a week and to Q every day during my birthday week to include Rush Hour.  I also am pushing more to incorporate more stretching at the start and end of the workout.  Today is KKC challenge day so I was not sure how many would show.  We had a total of 15 with 1 FNG.  He was EH’d by Wreck-it-Ralph from F3 Summerville who was visiting us.  They were also late as they arrived at the warm-up.

We moseyed over to the community center parking lot to warm-up.  As we were getting stretched out, Wreck-it-Ralph and his EH FNG come strolling in.  Yes, we did reward burpees x10 and reminded them our start time is 0630 hrs.

**Warm-up:**

GM, hamstring stretch (feet together, right over left and left over right), calf stretch (feet together, left over right and right over left), control freak merkins x10, 10 reward burpees for Wreck-it-Ralph and EH FNG being late, sir fazio (forward), seal claps, overhead claps, SF backwards.

Walk over to the rock pile.  Partner up. Partner 1 picks a none traveling rock. QIC calls Dora 2-3-4.

**Thang 1:**

Dora 2-3-4: Partner 1 starts the Carolina Dry Docks x200, Rock curls for gurls x300, LBC x400 while partner 2 runs to the road and back (walkers walk half way and back to keep everyone close).

As I was doing the thang, I was keeping my eyes on the clock.  It consumed 30 mins of the workout (WOW).  As we were moseying to thang 2 which was supposed to be to the kiosk and my original plan, I had to modify for the sake of time.  I changed my direction to head to the entrance of Bond Park to do thang 2..

**Thang 2:**

5 rounds with the Russian Bear - Ivan Koloff (you’ll know why later in the NMS why I chose this name). At each light pole, Wolverine Burpees x5 and air squats x10 until we get to the end of the road.

Once completed, QIC calls to mosey back to the flag and circle up for thang 3 Mary around the circle with the infamous deck-of-pain.

**Thang 3 Mary:**

Deck-of-pain PAX choice around the circle. As we were going through Mary with the deck-of-pain, the PAX started to realize that the deck was stacked.  On exercise #13 (Yogi’s turn), he picks up the deck and reveals to the PAX that the rest of the cards were only 9 through King and Ace. Yes the Ace was 14.  In true fashion, we stuck to the format (you guys are HIMs).

QIC ended with 100’s and Have a nice day
