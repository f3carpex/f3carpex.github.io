- Opening – There was no FNGs this morning so ran through the pledge, grabbed our bells and off to the circle.
- Warm-up – SSH, daisy pickers, windmills, calf stretch, and Abe Vigodas.
- The Thang – circle up for 10 reps each side of overhead single arm squats, followed by 10 reps each side of plank rows, followed by 15 reps pullover to sit-up. Mosey to circle and back. Circled back up for Australian pushups, half-kneeling halos, and T-pushups. Mosey to circle and back. Circled back up for squat knees, lateral kettlebell drags, and tricep extensions. Mosey to circle and back. Circled up for clean and jerk to windmills and overhead squats. Mosey to circle and back final time.
- Mary – made it through 8 of 10 PAX for their choice of Mary. Choices included box cutters, American hammers, low slow flutter, and among others that I can no longer remember other than the pain I now feel in my core.
- Announcements- Hells Bells is moving to same site as Tortoises where YHC will be a site Q.
- Who took us out- Earhart took us out as final AO at this location.
