Davis Drive park has got to be one of the darkest places in an otherwise bright and somewhat beige world of Cary. Wait, is this where the Beige Bros got their name? Nevermind, I digress. It's dark at Wolverine. Not too dark to know where to do pull-ups before the witching hour of 0530. It's a busy Monday, with 17 PAX making the journey this morning. No FNGs, so a very abbreviated disclaimer was given. First exercise, Pledge of Allegiance

## Warm Up

One lap around the soccer field, then circle up on the basketball court. Complete Good Mornings, Abe Vigodas, Sir Fazio Arm Circles, Seal Claps, Steve Earles, Plank Jacks, Runner's AND Calf Stretches. Mosey back to the bottom of the parking lot.

## Thang 1

Rocky Balboa was the greatest champion of our time. Greater even than the Nature Boy, Ric Flair! Today we will honor Rocky with music from his movies and exercises that he or his compadres did in training.

Partner up - while one partner runs the trail loop and up the steps, just like Rocky ran the steps in Philly, the other partner completes sets of Plyo merkins x 5 and American Hammers x 20. Each partner completes 5 rounds.

## Thang 2

Keep your partner. In order to get lightning fast, like Rocky did in the 3rd installment to beat Clubber Lang, one partner does sets of Fast Feet x 30, and also works on boxing and ducking skills by doing Joe Louis x 20. The other partner runs to the playground and completes 5 pull-ups. Complete 4 rounds.

Take a cool down lap around the soccer field, and meet back at the basketball court.

Before Mary, complete 10 Apollo Creed Burpees for good measure. RIP, Apollo.

## Mary

WWII situps until 0615

## COT

There were 17, and a bunch of Respects. Remember Respect week coming up. Dang yall are old. Please remember Burt as they mourn the passing of his M Becky's mom Sue. Remember our country during this time, and also remember who is in control. YHC took us out.

## NMS

- Playlist is Rocky Soundtrack (1-6) on Spotify. An eclectic mix there.
- Good to see some guys I don't see often, and a couple I'd never met.
- Not sure exactly what was going on under the shelter. Too early to drink, maybe?
- One Four got to do pull-ups, so he was happy
- Hi-Liter remembered we used to do Happy Jumping Spiders
- Apollo Creed Burpee was a first time thing, won't be the last
- I believe in the Bible as God's perfect word, and my Bible tells me a couple things about our leaders that is important to remember. First, God commands that we pray for our leaders, and respect them. Second, God reminds us that every leader is in place because He put him/her there.
- MIAGD, and strive to be a little better than you were yesterday!
