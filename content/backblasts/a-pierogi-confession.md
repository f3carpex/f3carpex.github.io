_To whit_: I had not, to date, really tried to deliver a good ol', shut yo' mouth F3 beatdown so when the SNS Twitter handle kindly reminded YHC of the Q the next day, that's what I vowed to try and do. If the other PAX feel even a small fraction as sore as I do this afternoon, success!

### Warmup

- SSH
- Sir Fazio & claps
- Cotton pickers

### Thang:

- Form into 3 lines and scout run to the end of the main road through Bond (sprint to the light post)
- Recover care of Jack Webb 1:4 Merkins:Air presses
- Catch Me Indian Run to main parking lot (5 DM when peeling off)
- Recover with Lt Dans 1:4 Squats:Lunges (each leg one)
- 4 corner escalator (10-20-30-40) - 10x squat - 10x LBC - 10x overhead claps - 10x burpees
- Bear-crawl inchworm to the end of the parking lot
- No time for mini-Dora so Mosey back to main parking lot for...

### High tempo Mary:

- American Hammers x10 IC
- Leg Raises x10 IC
- Heel touches x10 IC
- LBC x10 IC
- Boat/canoe x10
- Flutter kick IC (each PAX did a 4 count around the COT... ~120 total)

### COT:

- Count-a-rama: 22 for SNS and another 8 for Vespers (Hermes, Term Paper, Michelob, Hot Spot +3 others I don't recall or thought were with SNS the whole time)
- Announcements:
    - F3 Dads camp: sign up! Currently ~60% filled and need to fill the whole thing
- Prayers & Praises: praises for John, Chinese Downhill's mom and WKRP's colleague.

### NMS:

- CARPEx: sign up for F3 Dads Camp. It's the least we can do with Borland braving I-40 at 5:30AM!
- We finally have proof that Angry Elf and Wonder Bread are separate people... although dressed very similarly
- First time I've been at SNS without Saban
- Happy to have some of the Vesper regularly join in the fun. Shout outs to Franklin, Denali, Sooner!
- The PAX could work on their lunge form... just saying.
- Word is that Burt got a little too close to Nature Boy's nature during the bear crawls.
