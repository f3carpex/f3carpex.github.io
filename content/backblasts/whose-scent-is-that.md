F3 Dads is this Saturday

**Prayers and Praises**

Pivot with some good words about not sleeping well, but then realizing that he has F3 to look forward to, and what it has meant to him. Aye’s all around

Yoga Mat friend who lost her mother to car accident on Kildaire Farm. Prayers for the family as they struggle with this including different religious beliefs about their next steps.

Those affected by Ethiopia plane crash.

**NMS**

I had been wanting to Q another workout with music, and FWD seemed like the perfect AO.

Great to see Pivot and Red Ryder venture over to East Cary.

The scented candles were a last-minute addition because I wanted to have the lap running somewhere other than the traditional pickle and I had noted how dark it was there the previous week. Not sure if I will break them out again, but it did make for quite a bit of varied mumble chatter.

Thanks to Greenbow for the late arrival and the bonus burpees. Hermes remembered that his name was Forrest – impressive

TClaps to Smokey on the resting heart rate drop from 80 to 60 since he started F3

Texas Ranger was sporting fine head gear today.
