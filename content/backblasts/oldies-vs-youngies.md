12 PAX decided to get up 15 minutes early this morning.

One of them was Burt...get a few Bond Brother brews in @burtcarpex and it's easy to talk him in to posting to Kryptonite.  Knowing this I thought it'd be fun to peg the Respects against the millennials (if they would just put their phones down.)

Jog down the Koka Booth parking lots to the way back and circle up for warm up...

### The Thang

\-  **Paint the lines** with a Bobby Hurley (or Wojo if you're YHC) at the top of each line.  Each  median do 2 merkins going up in 2s each median

\-  Grab the biggest rock you can find now and split up #Respects and #YoungGuns.  Some of the "young" guys had to even out the teams and move over to the old squad.  We won't say who... -  OK now _switch_ rocks with the other group (oh snap).  Your rock is now the 'other teams' rock.

\-  **1 group run around the median while the other group holds a rock over their head.**  Each lap do CDD for the sum total of the guys still holding rocks over their heads.  Stop at 5 total laps if the guys are too strong and won't quit.  #Flapjack -   Same thing next lap set but with burpees.  #Flapjack

\-  **Next we tried a partner suicide** thing that isn't worth repeating.  It sounded better in my head and I didn't explain it right.  #ClusterQ

\- Run out of the parking lot to the right and cross over to the business parking lot.  There is a bit of a hill here.  Perfect for 7s.

\-  7s always facing the same direction:  Meaning run backwards up the hill, Crapjacks at the top, Merkins at the bottom.  Oldies in 1 group, Youngies in the other to make room for everyone.

Indian run back to the cars...LATE AGAIN!!  Sheesh...

Great work by all.  Welcome FNG Half who found us via his M reading resumes with F3 showing up under "Leadership Qualities" left and right!
