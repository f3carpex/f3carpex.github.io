**Pre-Blast**

This being my virgin Q and my first time at SNS, I truly appreciate all the support and advice from the PAX.  Special thanks go to Angry Elf for the pep talk the night before and for planning the Thang with the pain sticks.  I do wish I had made it to Q school. It is amazing how much I didn’t pick-up naturally from two months of just doing the workouts. The mumble chatter was justified, and it kept me in line; particularly, when I would call one exercise and then let the QDRENALINE turn it into something else entirely. Yes, there was a jar of cherries and a box of toothpicks. Well played.

It was an honor to lead this morning.
