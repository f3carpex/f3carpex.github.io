**AO: A-Team**

**August 13, 2018**

Stepping in late last night to sub for an injured Pet Sounds, YHC posted what innocently turned out to be a somewhat misinformed plan for a Route 66 around the lake. Shout out to Sosa for warning of construction and related obstructions.  Upon arrival and inspection of this particular AO (YHC's first posting there), it was decided by a committee of one to modify.  And, it being Monday the 13th, why not play in the parking lot with that number.  And so it began.

**Warm-Up**

Mosey to the first parking lot, circle up.

Good Mornings, Windmills, SSH's, Imperial Walkers - all on a 13 count in cadence

**Thang 1 - Ascending Curb Crawl**

Line up in the parking lot along the curb stops, Bear Crawl across to the other side, 1 Urkin on the curb stop, Crawl Bear back, 2 Durkins on the curb stop, repeato, ascending.  So... the idea was to get to 13 on both sides...Q called a "Recover" at 7 and 6 (that's 13, right...).  This routine is ideally suited to a subdivision street (about 22 feet across). The lot was about 2x that wide... admittedly a bit ambitious

**Thang 2 - Dan Taylors**

In the parking lot, 1 Squat + 4 Lunges, jog to the next light post, 2 Squats + 8 Lunges, repeato and ascending to 13.  Q called a modification to 1:2 ratio about half way to reduce moaning, groaning and whining of the mathematically challenged (and by then rubbery-legged) PAX.

Recover and mosey to a circle for Quad Stretch, Calf Stretch Merkins, Plank Jack, Recover.

**Thang 3 - Route 66 (modified for time)**

Not to leave the PAX in suspense, Q called a modified Route 66 (as advertised) with Burpees and Squats, up to 7 reps (in hindsight, not really sure why 7).  Mosey to the lake, stopping along the way for pain stations and a quick lake view, then mosey back, stopping for 2x13 = 26 Dips on the bridge and a final 7 Burpees and 7 Squats at the top of the hill.

**Mary**

LBC's, Heel's-to-Heaven, Box Cutters, Low Slow Flutters all 13 count in cadence.  Have a Nice Day.

**COT**

**Count-a-rama**: 12 (3 Respects) **Name-a-rama**:  YHC Bayonne, Repeato, Smokey, Banjo, Imp, Bartman, WKRP, Ascot, Daisy, Speed Racer, Chipper, Hotspot

**Prayers / Praises**:

Prayers for Pet Sounds, McCants, Ascot's Brother and Ascot's pending arrival of 2.9

YHC took us out

Thank you, men for your companionship, fellowship and trust in me this morning.
