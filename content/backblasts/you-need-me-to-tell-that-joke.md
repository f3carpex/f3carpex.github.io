A large crowd gathered in the drizzly gloom. It was as if God was crying over the tragic death of our F3 Lexington brother, Cheech. At 0545, we gathered around the shovel flag and bowed our heads for a moment of silent prayer in his remembrance. Then - as I'm sure Cheech would have wanted - off we went. To the back, past Cheddar Bo shed, around the cul-de-sac, and back toward the shovel flag to the opening in the fence to the football fields. We'll gather on the one that isn't being watered while it's raining, shall we? \[_Side note_: I had this mental picture of Cheddar Bo in the shed with a cigarette hanging out of one corner of his mouth, a Cheddar Bo biscuit in one hand, and fumbling with the other hand trying to shut off the errant sprinkler system. It was still on when we left.\]

The Thang

_Some people_ \[not naming names (cough) Shut-In (cough)\] have taken umbrage to YHC's corny #dadjokes. So what better way to prove that #dadjokes are cool than to have a #dadjokes themed workout? But first, I must respond in the way that Colonel Nathan R. Jessup might have responded to the same level of questioning:

_Son, we live in a world that has jokes. And those jokes have to be told by men with guns. Who's gonna do it? You? You, Shutty? I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom. You weep for my joke victims and you curse Ma Bell. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know: that my jokes, while droll, probably save lives. And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, makes men laugh. You don't want me to stop telling dad jokes. Because deep down, in emotional areas, you don't talk about at parties, you want me to tell that joke. You NEED me to tell that joke!_

First, split into 4 groups for some modified 4 corners. Do 10 burpees OYO. Then, starting in the middle of the field, travel as instructed to each of the 4 corners of the field. Each corner has a named exercise of which you do 25 reps once you get there (merkins, squats, star jumps, knee tuck jumps). To 2 of the corners, lunge walk out, do the appropriate exercise and run back. To the other 2 corners, crab walk out and run back. Each time back to the center, 10 burpees OYO, plank it out, and when called upon, tell your best #dadjoke while we plank. Let's just say some were better than others. Only once did we have to do 5 penalty burpees because someone got stage fright. Soon we had folks volunteering to tell #dadjokes. "Ooo! Ooh! I got one, Nan'tan!" Exactly.

Alright, over to the sidewalk and face the hill for a set of 5s. 5 times up the hill with ascending number of burpees at the top. Each time at the bottom do 10 squats. Splish-splash over to the basketball court. 1s and 2s people's chair on the fence while 3s and 4s do a standard basketball court suicide. Flapjack. Solicit a couple of #dadjokes instead of 10-counts and....

Follow me up and back down to the shovel flag for boat-canoes and 'merican hammers.
