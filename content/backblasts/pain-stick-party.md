**Pre-Blast**

- 8 for a pain stick party at BO.
- YHC worked with the fellas to make sure we ALL counted during exercises. There's only one way to learn to count cadence when you Q a workoutâ€¦ You have to practice by counting aloud when someone else is leading. It is definitely more difficult to breathe, but that's the point: you learn and grow stronger.
- WWW led the pace back to the flag.

**The Warmup**
