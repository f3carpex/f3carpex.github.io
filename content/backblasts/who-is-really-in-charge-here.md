YHC quickly chums up with YOGI to confirm whose Q it really is. I get the, “what me? “ with a hug. After catching up on a few work things we begin to mingle with the ECP men and those arriving. Good to meet Alamo, been reading a lot about him. Great to see Traffic Cone, have not seen that man in a while.

There will be no WWIIs or flutter kicks today. The mention of them will lead to 10 Burpee’s for everyone. There are a couple of guffaws and a very unhappy Yogi, but that’s the plan. It mostly has to do with YHC not liking the strain they have on his back, and picking on YOGI - couldn't resist.

There are no FNG’s, Traffic Cone leads us through the Pledge of Allegiance and we’re off, with a two line Indian run around the pickle then to the front of the church to warm up.

SSH, Imperial Walker, lots of sir Fazio arm circles while the men discuss their summer plans – that was not a crowdpleaser – most of the men’s arms were roasted- everyone just had to share their story, 10 merkins OYO, runner stretch, and pigeon stretch.

Mosey to the upper parking lot for my attempt at limited run: 10 merkins on the far side curb, 10 little baby dips on the near side curb, bear crawl to the far side, walk crab to the near side - AMRAP. After a couple of rounds, some idiot says something about WWIIs- 10 Burpee‘s - Frisco, do you have any idea who said that? We break things up a little with some American hammers, then resume.

Recover on the mosey to the pull-up bar for a round of half Cindy - 5 pull-ups, 10 merkins, 15 squats, 5 rounds. Times up, mosey to the flag.

We were led in Mary by: Honeycomb, Triple Lindy, Traffic Cone, and Alamo. We finish out with a very quiet have a nice day. Yep, another WWII comment, 10 more.

\- 1 pax  
\- Fourth of July convergence at Bond Park 7 AM. I’m sure they’ll be an extra credit run along with an extra credit pull-up option.  
\- Lots of prayers: Disco Duck and his wife, P-Trap and cancer, War Child’s family, two of my children traveling in Europe, Gilligan, and several others.

Limited running workouts continue to be challenge, but you guys always come through and make me better, and I am thankful. Had fun with this today, the WWII idea did not emerge till I saw Yogi, the rest is history. Banjo
