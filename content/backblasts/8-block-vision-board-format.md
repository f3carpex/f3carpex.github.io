The idea with the 8 Block is to IDENTIFY THE AREAS THAT YOU NEED TO WORK ON THAT IS SLOWING DOWN YOUR GROWTH AND WRITE THEM DOWN SO YOU CAN FOCUS ON OVERCOMING THEM.

The general idea is to take a piece paper, divide it into 4 boxes (a horizontal line and a vertical line) and each box addresses something that slows down your growth.  
   
Think about a word for the year that when you see it, will get you focused on your growth and will remind you to refer to your 8-Block periodically.  
   
Step 1 - Start in the top left block: this is where you jot down your Concentrica.

Concentrica: Think of a 4 ring target. Inner ring is your M (Most Important); next ring is your 2.0 (shorties); 3rd ring is your Shield Lock; 4th ring is your Stone.

If you identify any gaps that is affecting your relationship, jot this down and be intentional to closing that gap.  
   
Step 2 - Next is the bottom left quadrant which is your 2nd F: the idea with this quadrant is you should identify and LIST 3 guys that you need to spend extra time with. Remember the 3 guys you list don’t necessarily need to be F3 people – they are probably unique to you, but are people that maybe you have some work to do to be that friend that they need. LIST THEM BY NAME IN THIS SECTION.  
   
Step 3 - Next section is top right which is your 3rd F. This one is easy to plan but toughest to follow thru.  
In this section you need to list what you are planning to do SPECIFICALLY to grow your 3rd F (Faith and Service). Set some goals. Write them down and share them with your Concentrica so they can hold you accountable.

Examples:  
1\. What are you studying-again, be specific-“I’m going to read the Bible more” does not count – what part(s) of the Bible are you going to focus on?  
2\. Volunteer at church  
3\. Read Q Source  
4\. Volunteer in your local community  
   
NOTE: Whatever-it’s not so important what you plan to do, but MAKE A PLAN, WRITE IT OUT, THEN DO IT.  
   
Step 4 - The final section on the front is the bottom right: 1st F. To me, again, this is the easiest to fill out and relatively tough to follow thru. List your 1st F Goals – CSAUPs you plan to do (Mortimer, GrowRuck, BRR, run a 5K and work to a Marathon, Iron Man, Spartan Race,…), Goals for the year (Example: 1000 miles for the year, Q on average once a week for the year, set a goal for # of workouts to attend for the year, complete the Leadership Challenge). It seems best to me to take this in blocks within the year like maybe quarterly or even monthly.  
   
MUST DO: The idea is to think about what you can do, set a goal, write it down, then keep track of it. If it is worth doing, it is worth tracking and by tracking you will almost certainly get better. Some guys even pull their family or Shieldlock into these goals. Also, set a goal for how you will help EH guys or bring back a Kotter – how many can you get in the year? Maybe shoot for 1 per quarter or 1 per month if you are really up to it?  
   
Remember that word for the year, write that word in the middle of the page to help you remember it.

Note: You may start with a word of the year but feel as the year goes on, you may want/need to change it. This document is a living document, change as you see fit.

Flip the page over to the back-side and again, divide into 4 quadrants.  
   
Step 5 - Top Left back quadrant is the Jester – what is holding you back from being the best you can be. THIS IS TOUGHER THAN YOU THINK IF YOU HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED THIS. Read about this in Q Source and Freed to Lead then discuss the general topic one morning in the gloom with a Brother your close with, or if you are in a Shield Lock or in a Whetstone program, discuss it with your Shield Lock/Whetstone Brother. This will require a lot of thought up front and thick skin if you want to do it right. Keep in mind you may have more that 1 Jester.  
   
Step 6 - Bottom left quadrant on the back is DATE NIGHT: This applies to your M and your 2.0. The theme of this quadrant is that YOU SHOULD NEVER STOP DATING YOUR M AND YOU SHOULD DEMONSTRATE HOW YOUR 2.0 SHOULD TREAT OR BE TREATED BY ANY POTENTIAL FUTURE MATES. Date your M and date your 2.0, keeping in mind where each lives within the Concentrica.  
   
Step 7 - The top right quadrant on the back is listed as Podcast / Knowledge Building – what are you doing to make yourself better? What are you listening to and what are you reading to make yourself better? Think about this and write it down. What are you doing to mentally accelerate? Do you get home from work and sit in front of the TV and veg out until your M drags you to bed? Have a little purpose and plan that keeps you mentally in the game.  
   
Step 8 - The final quadrant is the lower right section and this area is labeled ALR (ask, listen, remember). This is the ADVICE area. Basically in this area, you should find someone to learn from. Find someone you feel knows more about something than you do and learn from them. In other words, find a mentor. This is a great Whetstone opportunity.

Next: share your 8-Block with you M, your 2.0s, your Shield Lock and your Stone/Blade.

Lastly, tape this to your mirror or magnet it to your refrigerator so you can see it daily. This will keep you focused on it.

Your acceleration to be a leader in your community is dependent upon you continuing to grow as a leader. Be intentional, focused and driven. You’re trying to create your own legacy.
