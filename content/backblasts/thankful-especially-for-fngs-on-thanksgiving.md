YHC is thankful for many things; my loving family, a full table this Thanksgiving, and a purpose-driven career. But, above all things, I'm thankful for the blessings of FNGs on Thanksgiving Day. More to come, but first:

The annual Thanksgiving Convergence means the men of Carpex descend upon the finest AO in all the land, Bradford's Ordinary, and this year the weather right-perfect for a proper beatdown.

EC run waves launched at 0600 and 0630 (psst, Frisco showed up at 0538 texting YHC, "um when are we starting?") and the rest of the pax arrived ready for the main event at 0700.

A pair of FNGs were there and YHC had an extra-special disclaimer planned that outlined how for the next 60 minutes these men (hates ta boot) would work out with F3 and if deemed worthy a nickname would be bestowed unto them. **And then a highlight of the disclaimer as YHC asked one of the FNGs (Red Ryder's 2.0) his name. He began to answer only for YHC to hit him with the, "it doesn't matter what your name is, Jabroni!" Classic (and I trust, Dredd approved). Now, onto the good stuff.**

**Warm-ups:**

- After the pledge, we head down to the fountain and circle up in the grass for GMs, SSH, Sir Fazio and Seal Claps capped off with HIM of the Year nominee Disco Duck and 10 burpees.

**Thang 1:**

- Partner up for Dora 1-2-3 w/ merkins, squats and LBCs
- Before rolling out Hi-Liter hit the pax with a 1st F reflection (see below for the transcription)

**Thang 2:**

- Get the pax from the fountain park to behind the Ivey-Ellington House (that's right no pax had ever been there during an F3 beatdown before... so... mission accomplished)
- Dora 4-5-6 w/ a second partner group and CDDs, lunges and dying cockroach
- Before leaving we had to get the pax on the wall for BTTW and People's Chair
- Hi-Liter hit the pax with the 2nd F reflection (again, see below)

**Thang 3:**

- We moved across the street to the bank parking lot for J-Webbs with the Godfather HIMself, Burt

**Mary:**

- We move back to the flag and circle up in the USPS lot for Freddy Murcs, Hello Dolly, Boat Canoe and Have a Nice Day... that's it.

**COT:**

- 44 deep including FNGs Can of Corn and ... wait for it... Turducken (Franklin was thrilled!)
- Hi-Liter took us out with the 3rd F reflection

**NMS:**

- Frisco texting me at 0538 concerned that he was in the wrong spot was classic Frisco
- Good job by the EC men
- 0 tank tops on TTT, but it was 35 degrees up in that mother
- I love you guys, and I am beyond thankful for the positive impact you've had in my life. _**MIAGD and attack it with an enthusiasm unknown to man!**_

**Hi-Liter's reflection:**

Let’s LIVE OUT our gratitude. Let’s put purpose behind our thanksgiving by...

...working on our fitness so that we can glorify God and serve others:

“Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies.” ‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭6:19-20‬ ‭NIV‬‬

...fellowshipping together so that we can build one another up and encourage each other to do what is right:

“Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing.” ‭‭1 Thessalonians‬ ‭5:11‬ ‭NIV‬‬

“And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds,” ‭‭Hebrews‬ ‭10:24‬ ‭NIV‬‬

...promoting faith that is proven by our actions so that we can honor Christ and those who have sacrificed for us:

“I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!”” ‭‭Galatians‬ ‭2:20-21‬ ‭NIV‬‬
