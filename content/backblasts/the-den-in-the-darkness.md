I showed up a few minutes before 0530 to find some returning EC runners who said the parking lot was dark when they left.  This is only my second time at the LD, so an impromptu darkness Q would have been unwelcome.  Luckily the Diocese had indeed paid the electric bill and the original plan was in effect.  No new folks, although Rock Lobster has shaved and looks like a different human.  Pledge and go. 

Mosey across campus with some carioca and shuffles mixed in. Circle up for:

- 20 SSH IC
- 1 really long OYO GM (for Crimson)
- 20 Standard Merkins OMD
- 20 MCs IC

Mosey to the lovely wooden planters nearby for 3 Rounds of:

- 20 One-Legged Squats (10 Each Leg)
- 15/10/10 Dips IC

Mosey back to the other side of campus for the Main Event.  On the way there is some discussion about how to tell the Hoo twins apart.  The general consensus seems to be that Wahoo is louder and less attractive.  Upon arrival we Counted The Lines.  Descending exercise reps (7 through 1) per parking space reached through a specified form of locomotion.  Then run a lap around the gigantic parking lot (while dodging ice) and PUTS.

- Round 1 - Bear Crawl and Burpees
- Round 2 - Crawl Bear and Merkins
- Round 3 - Walk Crab and WW2s
- Round 4 - Crab Walk and Crab Cakes
- Round 5 - Lunge Walk and Jump Squats

2 x 25 Calf Raises IC to decompress and then back to the flag for LSF, H2M and a brief homage to Peter Shawn Chilcutt.  While performing the Chilcutt, Wahoo verbally informed us that he isn't able to speak while doing the Chilcutt and then elaborated on that message through the rest of the exercise. No announcements.  Continued prayers for Yahoo (the quieter and more handsome twin).  Great reminder from Sooey on the anniversary of his surgery to appreciate every morning that we are able to be a part of these workouts.  YHC took us out.
