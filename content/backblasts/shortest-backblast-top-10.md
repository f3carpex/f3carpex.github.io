The numbers were low, yet very vocal during this relatively mild morning. We did log around 4.2 miles total! (#neckstrain)   Also, I have no idea how to change a date on wordpress, so for the record, this back blast is from December 1st.

**Thang:**

Hill 7's by kiosk (Burpees and CDD)

Flood wall by pond partner 1 rock the body, partner two run the levee loop (3 rounds)

Finish with a run around the pond for the whole pax, stopping periodically to do Imperial walkers and catch the six.

**Announcements:**

Christmas Party December 13th for Carpex 

**Prayers:**

Lonely people that have lost loved ones during the holidays

Thanks for allowing me to Q this morning and counting so loudly to keep the agenda moving forward.
