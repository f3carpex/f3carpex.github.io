**PAX:** 19 (FNG Lite-Brite)

Excited to hit up some BO this morning. YHC has been on the low low when it comes to Q-ing so I'm happy to get back in the game. With all of the new AOs the opportunity to lead a workout can only increase!

So just as my Twitter #PB announced I arrived at 0530 for some #TTT.  Stretched for quite a bit before the next cars mosey'd onto the lot.  Sidenote - Lots of chatter today about what a mosey pace should be.  Answer:  Whatever the Q says it is :)

Coney brought Burt's TTT collection and those with sleeves improved their wardrobe.  #AdditionBySubtraction(ofSleeves)

0544 disclaimer was presented and we were off for a warmup jog around the church lot and back up to the light poles of Academy.

**Warmup:** GM x 10, SSH x 25, 4ct Squats x 10, YHC is out of ideas so lets roll!

## The Thang

**Oh hey Mississippi!  10 penalty burpees!**

## The Thang

**Lazy Burpee 7s** Definition:  Lazy = not much running / Burpee = the main exercise / 7s = Burpees with \*squats like this: Light Pole 1 = 1 burpee _with_ 6 squats Light Pole 2 = 2 burpees _each with_ 5 squats  (10 total squats) Light Pole 3 = 3 burpees _each with_ 4 squats (12 total squats) OK you get the point.  I'm going to reintroduce this now that we all understand.

**Fountain Work** Here we would do an exercise to failure then upon failure run down the grass hill and do burpees until everyone arrived.  Later YHC audibled to run down hill and back performing burpees at the fountain...then audibled to squats.  Didn't mean to do all these burpees...

- Exercises:  Dips  /  Derkins  /  Aussie Mountain Climbers  /  Aussie Plank Jacks  /  Urkins

**Hill Sprints** Now at bottom of the hill partner up for 3 rounds of hill sprints with slowsey back down the hill after each round.

**Catch Me If You Can** 5 squats for CMIFC back to church lot down the back street (I'm not googling it just for the name.  I want to say Hunter or Hudson something with an H?)

**Bear Crawl / CMIFC** Execution wasn't on point here _but_ basically partner 1 bear crawls up the church road, partner 2 catches P1 takes over the bear crawl and P2 runs back down to the start and back to flapjack with P1 again.  Pax mentioned running to the finish line and back.  THAT TOTALLY MAKES MORE SENSE!  You will see this again and executed right...looking at you big FOD parking lot.

**Wait where is our flag!?  No flag!?  Who is Site Q round here!?  -  5 penalty burpees** Rewind a bit Bartman informed me earlier in the workout he's doing a 5,000 burpee challenge and this workout was really helping him out.  Well at the end bear crawl he said he only had 5 left to finish the challenge.  YHC found a very real reason to drop 5 more burpees on the Pax.  No flag guys!?  Come on we're better than that.  I think we only had 2 site Qs though (if anyone is looking for a good excuse.)

Shakira left and right x 10 IC Dying Cockroach x 20 IC (I could barely say 1-2-3 on the last rep so that ended the workout...)
