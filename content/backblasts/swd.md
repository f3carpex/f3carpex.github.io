Hey guys. What day is it? What time is it? I've lost all sense of reality at this point. I awoke, I think I put on underwear, and grab what smelled like a cleanish shirt. I miss my family. I miss the fartsack. But alas, I press on.

Q 8(ish) of 10(ish) awaits me at SWW and I can't let the fellas think I'm getting beat down. Let's get it!

A handful of HIMs approach the lot via foot after their EC run, and others on four wheels. We start at a RHC 0545.

**Warm-up:**

- Mosey to a back lot (Oofta and Cumulus join 0:45 behind schedule)
- Quick feet, Curb Climbers, Quick feet, Curb Merkins
- 10 Burpees OYO followed by Good mornings and Seal claps

    - A - American Hammer
    - N - Nolan Ryan
    - I - Iron Squats
    - L - LBCs
    - L - LBCs

    - Bear crawl to the middle for 10 partner merkins, lunge back
    - Backwards lunge to the middle for 10 partner WWIIs, lunge back
    - Bear crawl to the middle for 10 partner derkins, lunge back
- While at the court, 1-5 on the Jack Webb before moseying over to the pavilion

**COT:** 18 strong, announcements abound and prayers for Disco's M and Liverpool's family (love you bro)

**NMS:** 2 more to go, fellas, gonna bring it at the Arena and finish strong at the Crick tomorrow. [Coffee with Oofta was glorious](https://www.instagram.com/p/BkUvi5nF8md/?taken-by=f3carpex).
