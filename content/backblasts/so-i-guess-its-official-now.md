About six weeks ago I started swimming in my neighborhood pool on Thursday mornings. Five weeks ago I posted it on Slack for anyone to join me. Just two weeks ago Flacco showed up. Today, Flacco returned and both Theisman and Riptide made an appearance and when the workout was over Riptide posted on Slack that the "Inaugural Pool workout" launched. So like I said, I guess it's official now.

**Warm-Up**

Just imagine Michale Phelps getting ready for a swim. That's exactly what we looked like.

**The Thang**

1600 meters (that's 1 mile to you and me)

900m of drills - 100m each of the following - freestyle, breast stroke, Â back stroke, left side stroke, right side stroke, kick, pull, right arm only, left arm only.

break

500m freestyle (at a good pace)

break

200m freestyle cool down

- We didn't do Mary or a COT, but now that it's "official" ...
- For those wondering, this workout has always been on a Thursday. This week YHC is Qing Bounty Hunters so I moved it to a Tuesday. Going forward it will most likely always be on a Thursday (unless it's not.)
- It wasn't until this morning when Riptide asked what this workout was called and Flacco said Tritan with an "A" that I even realized I had been spelling it wrong. Tritan is a BPA-Free plastic. Not a good name for a pool workout. Triton is the Greek God of the Sea and son of Poseidon. Which makes so much more sense. My apologies to Jigglypuff for coming up with a great name that I butchered.
- In case you didn't know, Riptide is part merman.
- Finally, since I didn't have a quote for the Pax this morning, here's one I usually tell people about the importance of becoming a better swimmer when you're thinking about competing in triathlons.

> When you're tired on the run, you walk. When you're tired on the bike, you coast, but when you're tired on the swim, you drown.
