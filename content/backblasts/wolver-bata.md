22 men decided to start their week off right at Wolverine, where we attempted to force our collective Garmin watches to register some anaerobic benefit of a workout while logging few miles for my recently-post-long-run knees. And we succeeded with a custom-built Tabata-timed work out featuring only ONE thang, repeated three times. Each exercise was 45-seconds AMRAP, with 15 seconds to transition onward.
