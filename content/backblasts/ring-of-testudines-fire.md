YHC hadn’t Q’ed this year and with the 2018 Challenge announced, it was time to get in gear. Threw out open invitation to pick up a slot this week and was pleased to have Crimson take me up on the offer and get me signed up to lead Tortoises.

Small crowd today, but the energy level was high and it was a lot of fund to lead the group.

Crimson was hard selling the option of moving the AO to Waffle House. Twas tempting, but not on my watch.

Thanks @Ma Bell for the 4 corners Thors and Webbs idea. Thought the likelihood of a having a repeat PAX from Kryptonite was very low, but Squatter proved me wrong.

Great to see Spartan and WWW.

Always an honor and a privilege.
