**Warm Up:** 

Good Mornings, Side Straddle hops, Sir Fazio arm circles, squat holds 10 count and finally a spicy burpee warm-up to AC/DC’s Thunderstruck.  We jogged around the pickle and selected our new best friend ( KB) for the workout.

**Thang 1** 

Single arm raised KB lunges around the 1/2 pickle 10 per arm followed by pickle run and repeated. We kept moving the KB around the pickle and finished where we started. This provided a great quad stretch, activated the glutes and delivered some thunder for the shoulders. Modified as needed.

**Thang 2**

Prayer request for Ryder’s mom is getting better as well as some family friction. Ryder praised last weekend’s sermon at church and reminded us that GOD is always putting the right people in front of us.  Disco Duck requested prayers for his friend Bruce and the entire family going through the loss of his wife.

Final prayer dedicated to thanking GOD for our ability to come together on this early Monday to strengthen our minds and bodies and ask him to watch over us.

This PAX was a fun group to Q. They showed up ready to work. I hope sitting down tomorrow will be difficult ;)
