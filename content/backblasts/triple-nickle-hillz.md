A gorgeous morning in Cary!!!  60 degrees and 91% humidity after weeks of 80 degrees and 97%+ humidity!  With tour-de-Carpex month, the aim was to keep it challenging, but to also not scare off any infrequent Kryptonite visitors in the hopes they come back to this AO!  There's lots of running, sure, but it isn't **JUST** about running!  YHC was very pleased to see a solid stream of cars rolling into the AO as we got closer to M-Minute.  17 Pax total, a very nice showing for Kryptonite!

**Goals for this beat down:**

- Keep it Simple
- Enhance cardio capacity
- Improve VO2 Max
- Keep the Pax breathing hard and moving
- BRR Prep

5:30 sharp, no FNG's....let's go!  Brief mosey across the street for some warm up.

**Warmup:**

- 20 SSH
- 15 Imperial Walkers
- 10 Slow-Cadence Good Mornings
- Lizard Pose / Runner's Stretch, 10-count each side

Mosey over to the bottom of the long hill on Ederlee for the main event

**Main Event: The Triple Nickle**

- Five Wolverines at the bottom

    - (5 Wolverines, 5 Hillz, 5 Worst Merkins.....5x5x5, Triple Nickel, get it?)
    - (Speed Demons picked up the six and probably got an extra set)
    - The hill really started to suck on the fifth set, and mumblechatter was definitely at a minimum!
