Lots going on at Shakin' Not Stirred this morning.  The Maynerds were off early, Insomnia runners, departed just after the last Maynerd group, and at 5:45 the Vesper and Bootcamp group were ready to get going.

The Bootcamp hosted a baker's dozen, and it went down like this: Tight circle and each man was instructed to identify a fellow PAX that he didn't really know so well.  That was to be your partner throughout the workout.  Additionally, on the warm-up jog, men were instructed to find out some information about their partner (like how long they been rockin F3, how they got their name, favorite exercise, etc....).  Throughout the workout, the QIC called on a PAX member to tell us all the inside info about their partner.

So we jogged around the wannbe DangerZone Pickle and headed out to the other parking lot where we circled up for a few more warm-up exercises, which happened to be all in perfect cadence and somewheres between 5-15 reps:  Invisible Jump Rope, Moroccan Nite Clubs, Merkins, Mountain Climbers, Wright Flyers, and Saturday Nite Stretch.

Moseyed over to the top of Kiosk Hill.  With your partner:  Partner 1 run to bottom of hill and perform x 5 Sumo Squat Jumps and runs back up the hill, in the meantime Partner 2 is burning through 10 reps of SSH, PJs, and Merkins.  Flip Flop for 2 sets.  Planks and LBCs before we moved along.

Mosey to the SNS Amphitheater for a mini partner Dora (50 Air Force Ones, 75 Freddie Mercurys, and 100 heel raises) thingy that included one Partner holding Balls To The Wall ALAP while the other partner performed aforementioned exercises.  Flip Flop until the required number of reps was met.

Jog to the Boat Ramp parking lot where we performed basketball defensive slides the length of the parking lot each direction, the retro run to the bottom of the hill that leads into Boat Ramp parking lot.  Together with your partner, perform x 10 partner Derkins at the bottom of hill, run 1/2 way up for x 10 Plank Jacks, and then run all the way to top of hill for partner WWII sit ups x 20.  Run back to bottom and repeato.  Planks and so forth before we moved along.

Jog to SNS Kiosk and perform a short Catch-Me-If-You-Can with your partner across the other side of field to the small base of the hill.  LBCs x 25.

Ride The Wave across the entirety of the hill.  It looked cool a.f.!!!

Mosey to the Billy Line.  AYG to the Shovel Flag.

**Count-a-Rama and Name-a-Rama:**  With Maynerds, Vespers, and Bootcamp, I think the total was 39?  Add 2 more that were at Insomnia run.  41 total is a great morning. **Announcements:**  Riptides _Bangs and Bourbon_ on Saturday (see Slack for deets), Hermes mentioned some kinda passing of the Maynerd Q-torch to WonderBread (whatever that means). **Prayers/Praises:**  praise and prayer for Water Wings kid and Goose's kid, who both had successful surgery yesterday. YHC speeched about the other meaning of Shakin' Not Stirred, and took us out.

**Nekkid Mole Skin:**

- Insomnia was great fellowship with Callahan, Pierogi, Angry Elf, and Chipper.  Unfortunately about 2-2.5 mile into the run, Angry Elf appeared to have pulled his hamstring fairly bad---enough that he couldn't finish the run and had to walk all the way back to SNS.   Reach out to him.
- The Speed Dating with our partner today worked out great.  We all got to know our F3 brothers better today!
- I know this is nothing new, but it still cracks me up everytime:  Captain Kirk was wearing damned pajama pants and 2 (yes 2) jackets.  It was a sight to behold!  And he is super fast sprinting downhill; like crushed everyone!
- Nature Boy was too  embarassed to tell us what Riptide's favorite exercise was; prob GroupMe material.  He is something else, that Riptide.
- For the record, I never did speed date.  YHC was always surrounded by MHCs.

Twas a pleasure. Luvyoubye,  Flip Flop
