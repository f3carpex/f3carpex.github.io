Well there were about 8 or 9 HC's on the Slack channel for the pre-blasts.  Turns out we had 23 run the 10.7 miles for The Maynard or as our Nantan apparently wants to call it: The May May.

We also had 1 legendary servant leader: Shut-in volunteering to wash our feet, I mean serve as our course manager/swag waggon/emotional support/cooler retriever/safety official/cheerleader/mentor/and all around High Impact Man! If you are not sharpened by his Iron then you are doing it wrong.

The Thang: Turn right out of the parking lot on High House, turn left on Maynard, turn left on High House and turn left back into the parking lot.  Pretty simple huh.

Staggered start beginning at 0430 and ending with the Thoroughbreds departing at 0500.  All arrived back for SNS COT at 0630.  Most even did a couple boat canoes with Riptide, YHC was not having any of that.

NMS: -You fellas are amazing! -Thanks BOGO for some good 2nd F and for waiting on me at all the stop lights that were red, or maybe you just didn't want to get hit by a car... -I think Wonder Bread and Sky Blue started to early, we need to hold them back a little next time. -The staggered start worked out pretty good.  It was some much needed encouragement from my brothers passing me in the last 2 miles. -Thanks Ollie for standing out at the park entrance to pick up the six (YHC)! -Great turnout this morning, welcome to several first timers! -I'm pretty sure Burt's M would label us HIDAs! - Term Paper did you eat all 5 of those eggs yourself? Nice work! -Flacco that bacon looks delicious! - And Kitty has already posted some shirt ideas... - I guess one day i'm going to fall to the pressure of more technology in my life. The Strava app looks pretty cool.  For now, I will just continue to hang out with you early or not so early adopters. - If you can do TheMaynard, you can do..... - Sign up for the BRR here:  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15rquQdbp0cQl9bBe0r99C4s4N0AYDiZzKe-UOFD\_CB8/edit#gid=](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15rquQdbp0cQl9bBe0r99C4s4N0AYDiZzKe-UOFD_CB8/edit#gid=0)
