QIC: Monkey Nut

The thang: After warming up with a little run and some IST's, Windmill we got to the fun.

While flipping cards, each one represented a different exercise. Hearts were squats, diamonds where diamond merkins, spades were KB swings and clubs were curls. Jokers were wild (literally), each one someone took us somewhere different and different amount of running. We almost finished the deck, finished off with some Mary. Disco called out the last exercise (Burpees as no surprise to the Q). Nice work everyone.

Nice work by all, it was truly a pleasure to lead this morning. Good to see some familiar faces out there again as well.

Join us next week for another party with Snooze at the helm. Aye.
