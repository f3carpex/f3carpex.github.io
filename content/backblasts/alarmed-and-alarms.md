It was Sunday evening and I checked Hotspot's Q announcements and was surprised to see my name. Oh that's right, Denali asked me to sign up. I got on Strava and looked at segments around Regency and even looked at the Exicon.

3 for the Prerun

Warmup - Run over to the big parking lot for SSH, IWs, Merkins, Plank Jacks, and good mornings. Burt helped remind me to say recover.

Jog over to the other parking lot for Go Gos. YHC, Burt, and Grease called them out. First "go" forward, second "go" backwards and so on until "finish".

The Thang - ALARMs

Its in the exicon as Arms, Legs, Abs, Run, and M exercise. Our version was 5 Worlds Worst Merkins, 10 Lunges, 15 American Hammers, Run the loop, and 20 Merkins. Partner up and when you meet on the other side do the merkins. The loop was about 0.6 miles and we did 3 laps.

Indian run back to the flag and finish with some low flutter kicks.

COT - 12 and I took us out in prayer. I read this article recently that reminded me that God rules over sin and while Satan means it for evil, God means it for good. [Does God Rule over Sin?](https://www.desiringgod.org/labs/does-god-rule-over-sin?utm_campaign=Weekly+Email&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=69715359&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_aFDLICDbB9A-vN_Bd_pYsVe2BMkj1G734d041hhmeGRKBmKWpi0BfdSjhm9h_KY283yZVc0gRwXDbTvCctPVMAvMKlw&_hsmi=69715359)

Coffee with Denali at the end. Thanks for everyone coming out and letting me lead!
