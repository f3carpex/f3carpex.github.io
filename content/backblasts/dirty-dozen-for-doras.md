YHC responded to a well placed DM from the current Site Qs to make a return trip to Point Break.  Absolutely perfect temps as we circle up and talk about who the mystery Q may be.  An even dozen with no FNGs.  We would like to pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, but it is apparently still in Chops' car.  So we just mosey instead. 

A long lap around Waverly Place brings us to the Whole Foods parking lot.  I'm not sure if Whole Foods has banned us yet.  I'm also not sure if I care.  Based on the amount of money my wife spends here I'm doing whatever I want in this parking lot.

Quick mosey to the main courtyard where we run the Core Dora.

- 100 WW2s / 200 L/R Flutter Kicks / 300 LBCs
- Pickle Run up the stairs and around the Shake Shack

Since that worked well we run it again with some new exercises.

- 100 Dirkins / 150 Dips / 200 Irkins
- Same run loop

Mosey back to the flag, which Chops retrieves from his car on the way.

Odyssey this weekend.  YHC took us out.

Solid participation for Coffee at the Camry.  Hoppin' John rolls with heavy whipping cream and scoffs at the rest of you who use the basic stuff.
