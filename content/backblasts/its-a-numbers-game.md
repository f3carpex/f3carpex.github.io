Numbers here, numbers there.  We are inundated by numbers.  How fast were you driving, what was your GPA, how much did your house cost, what is your income, how much did you pay in taxes, how many times have you posted, how long have you been doing F3.  Numbers are everywhere and some are good and some are not so good.

Today was a celebration of numbers for Crimson.  The first number of celebration was 19.  Many exercises were counted to 19 and for good reason.  When YHC started F3 11 months ago, I knew I had some pounds to drop.  The medical professionals said so, the internet said so and my knees definitely were telling me so.  Through a lot of motivation from my F3 brothers and the constant support of my driver who keeps me accountable, I’m happy to report that I have drop 19 pounds in 11 months.  I never would have thought it was possible but it’s amazing what is possible when you put effort into it.

The second number of celebration was 53.  After turning 53 this week, sometimes I think I’m too old for this stuff.  But, when I look at the likes of @Smokey, @Coney, @TermPaper, @GasGrill, @Yogi and many others, I realize that age, if placed into proper context, is just another number.  These respects display what is possible when you put effort into it.

F3 is definitely worth the effort.

With that said, it was time to move on.
