It was another cold morning, but actually felt pretty good. Maybe F3 is making me tougher.

**Warm-Up** Mosey around the school parking lot and circle up for hillbillies (cause we're in Apex), Sir Fazios, cherry pickers, burpees, monkey humpers and Carolina Dry Docks.

**The Thang** Mosey to the stairs for three rounds of 22's. Round 1 - Australian mountain climbers and box jumps Round 2 - Irkins and dips Round 3 - Wonder bras and derkins

Short mosey to the parking lot for three rounds of triples, do the exercise, run to the top of the, do the exercise, run back, do the exercise.

Round 1 - 5 burpees Round 2 - 10 monkey humpers Round 3 - 15 Carolina dry docks

**Mary** LBCs, Homer-to-Marge, Goooood Morning

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  20 **Name-a-rama**:  5 RESPECT, 14 meh, 1 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for Cataracts's shoulder, Pickle's MIL, Leprechaun and all students starting a new semester, all the Respects that came out this morning, but especially Biner **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**   21 box jumps was not the way my knees wanted to start this day.

Great to have Leprechaun back in the gloom. Pickles is pretty OK too.

Wahoo and Yahoo were both there, one has a beard, one does not, I still don't know which is which.

Rooney showed up late, I had to call burpees.

Actually he was probably on time, but I didn't see him until halfway into the workout.

At least he did them, Pet Sounds ran away when I called them in warm-ups, and Franklin just ignored me and talked to Nature Boy.

My plan when I signed up for this was 1. Burpees and 2. Make it tough because Red Ryder will be there. We definitely did a few burpees, and I can barely climb stairs now, so nailed 'em both.

Thanks for coming out and letting me lead, let's go make it a great day!
