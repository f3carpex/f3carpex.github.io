9 Pax made it out to the gloom to get their beatdown on for day!  YHC got there a little early to set up for the ME, which I knew was gonna suck ever since I found it on the Exicon. (In a good way of course).

When the time came the disclaimer was given, the Pledge was recited, and we were on our way to the other parking lot around the corner for the warm up!

**_Warm Up:_**

- **Good Morning**
- **Daisy Pickers**
- **SSH**
- **Seal Claps**
- **Mtn. Climbers**
- **Calf Stretches**

**_The Thang: Death Star_**

With several head lamps and flashlights shining we ran to the grass in the middle of the running track where YHC had set up _10_ cones in the shape of a huge star.  Well, as good of a star as I could anyway with the limited light I had…

Each pax start at a different cone, do _20_ **Merkins**, and move counter clockwise to the next cone and do _20_ more.  Continue to each cone around the star till a total of 200 **Merkins** are done (or till failure, whichever came first).  Take a lap around the track, then repeat the Death Star routine, except with **WWII’s**. After that do the routine a third time with **Squats**, then take another lap around the track. 

On our way out we did **Calf Raises** on the stairs that lead to the track. 

At the basketball court we did some stretching to finish up!
