My first Q at Lion's Den and boy am I excited. I've got my winkie all set and I've researched the area on Google Maps. It's another hot and muggy morning but with the Shovel Flag planted by Sour Mash we are ready to begin. Disclaimer, no FNGs, Pledge of Allegiance. Set out on a mosey and Site Q tells me we must be quiet as we travel to and use the local park as the townhouse residence across the street claim this park as their own and is part of their HOA. Roger that!

Quietly we circle up for warmup: Steve Earle, Mt. Climbers, Cotton Pickers, Dive Bombers, Fluttering Supermans, and Good Morning.

Splitting into two lines and going opposite directions around the circle we Bear Crawl until both lines reach the other side for Mary 1

Mary 1: Crab Cake, Homer to Marge, Hatching Butterfly, Australian Snow Angels, Flutter Kicks, Side Plank Star Crunch. Mosey back to the church for some partner work and Thang1

Thang 1: Vacuum cleaners- 7 rows. This exercise will gives the pax a chance to push themselves to their very limits.

Mary 2: Bring Salley up: From the Chill Cut position come up to the plank position and then back down as the song prompt you to. Again, another gut buster that will test the Pax to their ultimate if they choose to go there.
