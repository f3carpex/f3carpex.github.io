It was a calm, dark, and misty morning at Phoenix as I prepared for my (solo) virgin Q, it also kinda served as an unofficial “kickoff” of VQ week, which will officially begin on Monday.  As expected the butterflies were stirring and the adrenaline was flowing, but I was definitely ready!  By 6:25 a total of 18 pax were gathered and ready for the workout, and after an official welcome at 6:30, we were off jogging to the parking lot of the community center for warm ups.  YHC may or may not have started out a little fast due to said adrenaline..

 

**Warm Up**

\-Good morning x 10

\-SSH x 20

\-Sir Fasio Arm Circles, forward and reverse x 10 each

\-Calf stretches

\-Plank Jacks x 10

\-Mtn Climbers x 10

\-Quick Feet on the parking stops x 15

 

**Thang 1**

We moseyed around to the back of the community center where we partnered up.  Partner 1 did **BTTW**, while partner 2 ran a lap around the building, then we switched.  After **10** **Sumo squats** and a recovery it was time for round two of **BTTW** and a lap around the building each, followed by **10 Prisoner squats**.

 

**Thang 2**

From there we jogged to the speed bump just past the community center parking lot.  We then proceeded, with our partners, with **Catch Me if You Can**.  The partners would have to catch each other after doing **5 burpees**.  We continued all the way to Bond Park Dr entrance.  After plank holding for the six we proceeded with **10 boat canoes**.  Then it was **Catch Me if You Can** all the way back to where we started, with partner 1 doing a prisoner run and partner 2 catching them after doing **5 Carolina Dry Docks.**

 

**Thang 3**

After a quick recovery we walked over to the big grassy hill just off the walking trail.  One partner did **Crawl Bear** all the way down the hill and did **5 monkey humpers** before jogging backwards back up the hill.  Meanwhile the other partner was alternating between **10 Merkins and 10 LBC’s**, and would switch after being tagged by their partner after coming back up the hill.  After the partners had done both parts, they would repeat the exercise adding **5 monkey humpers** at the bottom of the hill.  The workout finished when everyone reached **15 monkey humpers**.  At which point everyone gathered at the bottom of the hill.

 

**Thang 4**

While we were here, we made two rows for **Tunnel of Love**, as the active pax would **Zombie crawl** underneath everyone else.  Everyone went twice, before **Indian running** back to the flag.

 

**Mary**

I wanted to do something different for the mary time, so I bought a 12 sided foam workout dice and customized it with F3 mary exercises.  One pax was in the center and rolled the dice.  After calling what exercise it landed on would drop to a low plank hold until everyone in the circle had completed it. They would then jump out of the center and back into the circle while next person took a turn.  The exercise continued until everyone had a chance to roll.  Finally, a quick rep of **Have a Nice Day** rapped it all up.

 

**COT**

**Count-a-rama**\- 18

**Name-a-rama**\- 1 Hate, 13 Meh, 4 Respect

Great job today guys!

 

P.S. – It was truly an honor and an awesome experience to lead the pax today.  Thank you guys so much for continuing to push every workout, and for encouraging me to step out and lead this morning!  Y’all are awesome!
