Note: I put the usual Parker jokes in the beginning of the BB. Anything over 20 words he typically skips. Going way too fast or tapping out after just a few reps has been a problem for a while I hear.

OK now we can get down to business. (Note: I’ll put the Pierogi jokes at the end because I believe his issue is false advertising of the merchandise and never being able to close the sale.)

Now we can really get down to business.

Five guys, Leprechaun and Bag Boy 8 minutes late (we did 8 burpees). Rock work broken up by pickle runs. Bag Boy spit twice in my face (real luggees, not those nambi pamdi ones WWW could barely manage) then Bag Boy urinated on my shoes. I asked Intimidator to call a very slow set of 10 reps of rock exercises since he is bad with counting after the number 7 (which is why my Qs are always screwed up—it’s him not me!!).

We did some Mary, too.

COT: 2 respects, 1 Meh, 2 hates

Announcements: Odyssey coming up, details on slack.

Prayers and praises:

One of our own: F3 High Tower in Myrtle Beach. Terrible situation. I don’t know what to say about it.

NMS:

I am known as a man of few words. Here are a few: we’ve got to come together and figure this stuff out somehow.
