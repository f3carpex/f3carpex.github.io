A few months ago when the idea for Green Mile was born, I knew I'd want to lead a workout there, but I also knew that 90 minutes was a long time and I might need some help. I reached out to Red Ryder, and he was happy to jump in and give me a push.

**Warm-Up** Pledge allegiance to the flag, then take a lap around the pickle and circle up for side straddle hops, Good Mornings, Moroccan nightclubs and Control Freak Merkins. Throw in a few bonus burpees for our late arrivals.

**The Thang** Bear crawl under the visitor's bleachers to the track for the Sheldon Cooper. Ten burpees, ten merkins, ten squats, ten LBCs, take a lap. Then nine, then eight, down to one.

Break it up in the middle with 22's. Run up the home bleachers, 21 derkins, run down the ramp in the back, 1 dip. Repeato, dropping four at the top, adding four at the bottom, finish with 1 derkin and 21 dips.

Everybody do two sets of AMRAP pull-ups on the shakiest pull-up bars in all of Carpex, then finish the Sheldon Cooper.

Bear crawl under the visitor's bleachers to the parking lot for a one minute rehydration break.

Line up for the Number of the Beast. Six trips across the parking lot, stopping at six islands, performing six reps of the chosen exercise. Round one is burpees (of course), then monkey humpers, Carolina dry docks, cox butters, prisoner squats, and another round of burpees (of course).

**Mary** Back to the flag and circle up for pax-led Mary. Pet Sounds immediately tries to call Catalina wine makers, nip that in the bud. Instead LBCs, American hammers, Homer-to-Marge, Hello Dolly, Rosalita and Have A Nice Day.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  14 **Name-a-rama**:  2 RESPECT, 11 meh, 1 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for Liverpool's talk at church, Hi-Liter and daughter, kids going back to school, Parker's father-in-law, Red Ryder's son, Chinese Downhill's mother and brother strong>BOM:  YHC took us out

**NMS** Don't know what conditions were like at the trophy handout they had a Phoenix, but we had 100 degrees, 200 percent humidity and 0 wind at Green Mile.

Someone tried to give the credit for Control Freak Merkins to Hi-Liter. No way. Red Ryder came up with the idea, Burt came up with the name.

Sub ran an EC half marathon before we started.

Earhart complained about some guy named Buck Furpees the whole time.

Enjoyed hearing Kilmer's cadence again, it is impressive.

Pet Sounds wants to change the start time to 06:10, but Snots ain't having it.

We're claiming the AO burpee record at 137.

How worn out was YHC after this? Sitting next to Ma Bell t coffeeteria, I call out 13 names then ask who I'm missing. It was Ma Bell.

I wanted to cut the Beast short after four rounds, but I knew you wouldn't let me.

I wanted to call any exercise other than burpees during the last round, but I knew you wouldn't let me.

Thanks for giving me the push I need to do things I'd never do on my own.
