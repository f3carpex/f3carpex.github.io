8, er 10 HIMs braved the monsoon rains to crush some Kettle-Dora, 7s and 11s at Hell's Bells. Here's how it went down:

**Warm Up**

We don't wanna get those kettlebells wet, so we convene at the shelter and triangle up.

Standard fare of: SSHs, Sir Fazio, Good Mornings, Overhead claps, Hill Billies and Merkins (on YHC's down AND up)

**Thang 1.0**

Partner up, size does not matter.  Partner 1 does single count L-R step ups, Partner 2 works on:

- 100 curls
- 200 kettlebell swings
- 300 goblet squats

Do a victory lap around the circle in the rain.

**Thang 2.0**

Time for some 7s.  We triangle up, 6 Rock your Bodies and 1 Tricep extension.  Continue until the numbers are completely reversed.

There's still time left?  Ok

**Thang 2.1**

Modified Burpee 11s.  10 Merkins, then to your feet and 1 overhead press.  Continue until the numbers are completely reversed.

One more victory lap before...

**Mary**

YHC calls American Hammers, then we continue PAX choice around the triangle until the clock strikes 6:15

**COT**

- 1 Respect, 1 Hate, 8 Mehs
- Announcements: Convergence for Carpex Anniversary on 8/30, Red Ryder-versary the week of August 6th
- Praises/Prayer requests: Successful BBQ fundraiser by Kubota, Hotty Toddy with a successful work test complete, and continue praying for Disco and his M Kelly.  YHC took us out.

**NMS**

- Crimson & Sooey were ALMOST late.  They were saved by Sooey's watch.
- Then Crimson & Sooey were late because the Sooey-mobile wouldn't start after the beatdown.  Crimson said if he had been driving it wouldn't have happened.
- We triangled up under the shelter because there wasn't really any way to form a circle.  It worked.
- A couple HIMs made their first visit to Hell's Bells, and hope it won't be their last.
- Frisco got a little more quiet about 2/3 of the way through the morning, including an epic voice crack at the end.  He pulled it back together for a strong finish.
- Be a little better today, than you were yesterday.
