So except for the 3 new AOs, Rush Hour was my last site to Q to complete the 2018 Challenge. I had only been to RH one other time, the week before, but it was enough to scout out some locations and get the skinny on how things go down here.

I had been told to expect a small group, so I was pleasantly surprised to see 11 other HIMS ready for the beat down. I go to meet Freon and Press On, as well as work out with Kermit and Speed Racer, who I hadn't seen in forever. And I was really excited about FNG Spock coming out who was EH's by Captain Kirk himself.

Plus, our roving reporter Hello Kitty was there and I got to spend 5 good minutes with him.

5:45pm. Disclaimer for Spock and off we go.

We mosey around the parking lot to the open field near the parking deck.

**Thang 1** Partner Up - Both Partners Crab Walk away from each other to the opposite ends of the lot, then perform 2 Crab Cakes. Run to middle to meet partner and perform 2 Partner Squats. Repeat 5 times increasing reps by 2 up to 10.

Flap Jack. Each partner ascends the stairs one level at a time performing 5 Tuck Jumps at each platform until they get to the 6th level at the top.

YHC took us out with a quote from Ayn Rand in Atlas Shrugged

> “Devotion to the truth is the hallmark of morality; there is no greater, nobler, more heroic form of devotion than the act of a man who assumes the responsibility of thinking.”
