These are strange times indeed. With the declaration of a global pandemic, due to COVID-19 infection, the world as we know it has changed. And will likely never be the same again. Our schools have closed, travel is quickly coming to a screeching halt, and may of the PAX and M's who are accustomed to going to a job every day are being asked to work from home. Worse, due to the massive economic impact, some are losing their jobs.

The mission of F3 is to plant, grow and serve men's workout groups for the invigoration of male community leadership. How we continue to serve this mission will be determined in the days and weeks to come. What is certain is, this is what we have all been preparing for. The Minivan Centurion.

The problems of this world will not be solved by weak men.

We are faced with very serious, sometimes grave decisions. And the tough thing is, there may not be one right answer. Many PAX have made the difficult decision to not attend boot camp workouts for now. Others who choose to attend are being asked to abstain from the hugs, fist bumps and high fives. As we head into these unprecedented times, we simply must be strong leaders. Leaders for your family, leaders for your coworkers, leaders for your F3 buddies, and leaders in your community.

Nine PAX gathered in Downtown POGL for an impromptu, not well planned beatdown.

## Warm Up

SSHs, Sir Fazio arm circles, Seal claps, Steve Earles, Plank Jacks, and Control Freak Merkins

## Thang 1

Mosey to the Methodist church, pick a non-traveling rock. Do 10 ManMakers, 20 Squat Thrusters, and 30 curls, then run the pickle. Do this 4 times.

## Thang 2

Mosey to the original launch site of DTP, Apex Baptist Church. On the way stop at the church for BTTW - up to cadence count of 49.

7s on the hill - Dying Cockroaches at the bottom, World's Worst Merkins at the top. Mosey back to the flag.

## Mary

American Hammers

## COT

9 Mehs. Prayers lifted up for our national, state and local leaders, for all of our brothers and their Ms in the health care field, and Yahoo's friend who lost his battle with cancer. YHC took us out.

## NMS

After we finished sharing in COT, standing 6-8 feet apart and praying, we just stood there. No one left. We continued to share about our hopes and our fears with what is going on in the world. But never forget - this is why we are here. Lead from the front, laying out the 43 feet for those behind us. Be a good neighbor, help a friend. Sometimes that help might come in the form of staying home with our families. But find your way to continue accelerating - times like this try a man's soul. Find your way to be better than you were yesterday, and in the process set that example for others to follow.
