Arrived at the flag at about 7:56 after a really good breakfast for dinner. You ever have breakfast for dinner? That is THE BEST. However, the ice cream sandwich after was prolly a little over the top, and YHC will regret that later.

## Warm Up

Two laps around the pickle. Circle up for SSHs, Steve Earles, Sir Fazio arm circles, Runners stretch, calf stretch, merkins x 50

## The Thang

Mosey to the end of the tennis courts. 11s on the infamous hill - CDDs on the tennis court side, and jump squats at the top of the hill by the speed bump. A little twist - ascending burpees in the middle.

Run out of time so PUT6, meet back by the tennis courts for merkins x 25. Mosey back to the flag.

## Mary

A bunch of stuff I don't remember, except Tang did NOT call Superman Bananas when called upon, and merkins x 25.

## COT

Strong representation of Hates and 2 Respects. Good to see some new faces. YHC took us out.

## NMS

Yeah, that meal before the workout sat on the stomach like a rock. After the workout, Tang posted that this was like your dad kicking your ass, but you were ok with it because you knew you needed it. Dad loves you; be a little better today than you were yesterday son.
