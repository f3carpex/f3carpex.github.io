Thanks to the vets for helping me out this morning. I recognize I should be taking lessons from you.

We've got VQs in the works from Amway, Claypool, Dr. Seuss, and Vegemite. Nice work, gentlemen.

I sensed some controversy over "end the workout at 45 minutes, then COT" versus "end COT within 45 minutes." I'm squarely in the latter camp. Get it all done in 45 minutes.

Two years ago, [I was here](https://twitter.com/F3Carpex/status/1135496277498716161). F3 is a ladder. I'm grateful to provide a foothold, the same way that others boosted me up.
