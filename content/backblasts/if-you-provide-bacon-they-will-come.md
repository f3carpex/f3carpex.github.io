I have had enough birthdays where I don’t need presents or any particular celebration, but I love this group and wanted to give back on this day with a little token of my appreciation, so Bacon was the plan.

We actually only had 21 for the workout, but we are counting Large for his EC presence

Teaser alert -  Sooey planning a special Q -coming soon to Claymore

Awesome to see McCants – hopefully he can avoid any more injuries

We got kind of rowdy in the warm up, and hopefully didn’t wake the people across the street. There was a couple that happened by during it and they seemed to kick out of what we were doing

Group 3 was by far the strongest

Flounder Pounders were enjoyed by all for various reasons, but like the Penguins I introduced at SWW, they may not ever make a repeat appearance.

Great Coffeteria and thanks to all for helping me nail down the PAX list

Always an honor and a pleasure
