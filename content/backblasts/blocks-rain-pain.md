After posting several times with our fine F3 brothers in Hickory, NC this fall, YHC came to appreciate the versatile, yet potentially lethal concrete masonry unit (CMU aka "cinder block") in a workout. Call it an implement, a coupon, whatever you'd like...they're 38 pounds of jagged edged concrete.

After a quick run to Lowes', where CMU's can be found for under $2 a piece, YHC decided to create a morning around them. So off we went.

Four of us posted for the standing 3 mile EC (YHC, Chipper, Denali, Half), departing at 0510 into the very gloomy morning.

#### Warm-up

Circle up in the parking lot for Good Mornings, SSH, Windmill, Imperial Walkers (YHC's opening routine, more or less). Mosey out, up and around to the office buildings. Notable whining by Denali regarding the need for gloves, I think he found them useful later...

#### The Thang

Upon arrival at the offices, Q instructed the PAX to unpack the CMU's and commence exercise 1, station 1. Three stations, one exercise at each station, each a lap around the large lot with a bit of elevation change, as follows:

Station 1: 50 reps each, using CMU's of Rock Row, Kettle Bell Swing, Overhead Press, Curls, Tricep Extensions

Station 2: 30 reps each, Sumo Jump Squat, Lunges, Star Jumps, Monkey Humpers, Prisoner Squats

Station 3: 30 reps each, Merkins, Diamond Merkins, Peter Parker Merkins, Carolina Dry Docks, Wide Arm Merkins (thanks Term Paper for the guest Q on your signature move)

Mosey back to the parking lot. 2.5 mi recorded by the PAX, with some notable whining and crying along the way.

#### Mary, COT

Circle up for Box Cutters, Low Slow Flutters, American Hammers, Have a Nice Day.

Several announcements and prayers for Ausfartz and Joe Smith who's starting a new job.

**Count-a-rama**: 13 (2 respects); no FNG's  
**Name-a-rama**:  YHC Bayonne, Build-a-Bear, Adjacent, Stetson, Staubach, Denali, Joe Smith, Term Paper, Blue Water, Chipper, Meatloaf, Ashbury, Half

YHC took us out.  Thank you, men, for trusting in me to lead today.
