Today the PAX took fate in their own hands with a game I like to call:

**Let's Run Over To Some Hills And Randomly Pull Out Exercises  
From A Bag Written On Sheets Of Paper And Do These Exercises  
At The Top And Bottom Of The Previously Mentioned Hills**

or **LROTSHARPOEFABWOSOPADTEATTABOTPMH** for short.

EC Runners included Sub, Hanson, GTL, Freebird, Orphan and YHC

Disclaimer given to our FNG and we circle up

**Warm Up  
**Good Morning, Windmill, SSH, Steve Earle

**The Thang  
**Mosey over to the bottom of Saunders and Hinson St for some hill repeats. Break up into two groups, switching hills each round and pulling a piece of paper out of a bag with exercises for your group to perform at the top and bottom of the hills.

A few samples of the exercises are:

Top - 5x Star Jumps; 5x Merkins; 5x L/R Mnt. Climbers  
Bottom - 10x IC Freddie Mercury

Top - 10x Turkish Get Ups  
Bottom - 15x Big Boy Sit Ups

Top - 30 Cadence Count Plank Hold  
Bottom - 10x IC Low Slow Flutter

Top - 10x L/R Jump Lunges; 10x Wide Merkins  
Bottom - 10x L/R Peter Parkers

and so on... and so on... and so on

YHC took us out with a quote from Theodore Roosevelt

> "Courage is not having the strength to go on, it is going on when you don't have the strength."
