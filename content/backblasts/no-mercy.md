13 HIM came out to A-Team just 48 hours after the CSAUP Odyssey seeking no mercy, and getting none.

Cheddar-Bo showed up to unlock the gate as the PAX were gathering, but YHC made the call to stay where we were.

Warm-Up - Mosey over to the parking lot next to the big hill for some SSH, imperial walkers, plank jacks, merkins, and possibly the slowest version of Good Morning in Carpex history.

Thang 1 - Sevens on the hill, jump squats at the top, merkins at the bottom.

Thang 2 - Mosey back up the hill (a few of the PAX complained that we had just been there, it was music to my ears and just the fuel my tired body needed) and over to the shelter, stopping along the way for a Mary exercise or two.  In the shelter we did dips, erkins, step-ups, dips and derkins.  As someone noted, it was at least ten degrees hotter in the shelter than outside.  That's October in North Carolina.

Thang 3 - No time for another trip to the hill, so mosey back to the front parking lot, stopping along the way for a few Mary exercises.  If you haven't heard Mississippi's cadence you are missing out.  I enjoyed it so much I asked him to call a second exercise.

Mary - Back to the front parking lot with the PAX calling out their favorite Mary exercise.  Finish up with McCants calling merkins, Hello Kitty calling diamond merkins, and YHC calling burpees.

Announcements - Rucker/F3/FiA convergence this Saturday at Brier Creek (see Bartman for details), F3 Dads October 21st at Bond Park (see Hello Kitty for details), Marriage Workshop November 3rd (see Dr. Smokey for details).

Prayer/Praises - Prayers for Red Ryder's mother, dealing with rejection symptoms and other issues two years after a successful lung transplant, praise for the success of the Odyssey and the safety and health of all who attended.

NMS - I'm no longer surprised by it but I'm still excited to see the way this group of men supports and encourages each other.  Last night I wasn't sure my sore knee would let me post this morning, and Hot Spot was understanding and flexible with me, willing to take the Q if I couldn't make it.  Last week when it was chilly I mentioned I needed to pick up some long sleeve t-shirts, this week Nature Boy shows up with a couple of wrestling shirts for me.  All throughout the morning guys were encouraging each other, picking up the six, asking how things were going in their lives.  I'm proud and thankful to be a part of this brotherhood.
