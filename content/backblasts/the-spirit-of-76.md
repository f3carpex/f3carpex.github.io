It has been said that the Spirit of '76 is a patriotic sentiment referring to the attitude of self-determination and individual liberty made manifest in the Declaration of Independence. That spirit was well-exemplified at Phoenix today as we started looking forward to the 4th of July week with a them of '76.

WARM-UP

The Pledge andÂ 76 SSH, single count, some good mornings, and then we moseyed over to the Phoenix stadium in the grass.

The THANG:

At the bottom of the grassy hill we partnered up. Partner 1 stayed at the bottom and began burpees, working up to a total of 25. Partner 2 ran up the hill, did 7 overhead claps, and ran back down. The two then switched and did several rounds until each man had done 25 burpees total. Then we did 25 WWII's as a group.

Moseyed over to the dam all the way to the steps that go up on the far end. There, again, Partner 1 began working on 25 burpees while Partner 2 ran up the hill, did 7 Carolina dry docks, and ran back down. The two then switched and did several rounds until each man had done 25 burpees total there. Then we did 25 WWII's as a group.

Moseyed over to the Kiosk at the bottom of another nice hill at Phoenix with the paved walk way up. There, again, Partner 1 began working on 25 burpees while Partner 2 ran up the hill, did 7 prisoner squats, and ran back down. The two then switched and did several rounds until each man had done 25 burpees total there, equaling a grand total of 75 burpees each. Then we did 25 more WWII's as a group.

Next up, the great American wave = get in a single file line behind YHC and run up and down and up and down and up and down the grassy hill in Phoenix stadium in a wave-like fashion. At the far end of the field we circled up for 25 American Hammers. Then, moseyed back over to the Kiosk for 25 more American Hammers.

We then headed over to the amphitheater where we partnered up again. Partner 1 began 25 hand-release merkins while Partner 2 did lunge walks around the amphitheater and then switched. Each man did this three times for a total of 75 hand-release merkins and 3 times with lunges around the amphitheater.

Then, back to the Kiosk area for 25 more American Hammers, and then we moseyed to the traditional stop sign for the traditional sprint back to the flag. At the flag, each man had 1 more burpee, 1 more WWII, 1 more merkin, and 1 more American Hammer to complete 76 on each exercise.

Time's up!

COT:
