## #DRP

**Proverbs 25:28** - Like a city whose walls are broken through is a man who lacks self control

We each made the conscience decision to take the Red Pill - resolving to do what is hard and true, over what is easy.

Each day we make 1000s of decisions, some of which set the course for our lives.  Your first decision today was not easy, its raining, its cold, but you knew that through this effort you would be incrementally more than you were yesterday.  Conscience effort in making the right decisions comes from decretion. Do we overindulge or moderate? Do we fartsack or attack the day? Do we set the example? Be a professional with your life.  Does a professional skip the practice court, does he gloss over his education, does he look not engage his network to grow? The Daily Decisions you make set the course for your life. A professional refines his talents through practice daily.  A professional continues to sharpen his mind through education and readings. And a professional turns to his peers for accountability in his life. All takes effort and it starts with a decision.
