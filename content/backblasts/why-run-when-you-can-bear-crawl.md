When @Sooey proposed the idea of YHC taking on the open Q spot at Tortioses, the initial thought was "what about this nagging, lingering knee injury". The closer it got to Wednesday, YHC jumped in "just because". The spousal unit, aka the M, said "You complain constantly about your knee at home and you are going to Q? What are you thinking? Why are you doing this?" YHC had no viable response other than "just because @Sooey asked me to"... It was going to be a knee friendly workout to not cause further damage.

The workout was designed to let runners run while giving non runners the option to do alternative exercises.

@Bootlegger took us out

**NMS**: @WWW spoke about how F3 is good for men and is growing nationally for a reason.  
Bubba is down 15 lbs and standing tall and lean.  
@Bootlegger is down 35 lbs from the high. Keep it up @Bootlegger!  
@Tang is becoming a real beast. He laughed at the 11's with Bear Crawls....He is very motivating.  
YHC appreciates the challenge by @Sooey and the accountability from @Deuce.  
Having a shield lock is a real and valuable thing in the lives of men. It makes us all better.
