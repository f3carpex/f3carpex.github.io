19 men showed up for some calisthenics at Field of Dreams. What's there to say?... We did lots of circles around the parking lot. All told, we covered a little over two miles. We also did some creative rock exercises and debated the proper way to do a Dying Cockroach (the Q's way was correct). And most importantly, we met an FNG. Welcome Kung Pao!
