Apparently I’m being accused of becoming a runner as of late. With that thought, I did _consider_ running into FOD this morning, but as it’s 4.5 each way + the workout I had planned I thought the better of it. Plus part of the route being a bit dicey (2 lane road and dark) I opted for the drive in. 

With my plan ready to go and with FOD being a “late start AO”, I arrived early for a solo 3/4 mile EC. 

Back at the flag, 11 other HIM were warming up and ready for what was to be slightly sucky. With no FNG’s we started with the Pledge and a mozy to the large parking lot, stopping half way for 

**Warmups**

- Good Mornings
- Overhead Claps
- Seal Claps
- SSH
- Calf Stretches

Continue our mozy to parking the large parking lot for

**Thang 1: 4 Corner Escalator** 

- 10 Merkins
- 20 Squats
- 30 LBCs
- 40 Star Jumps

- Once done - we went back down the escalator

Mozy back towards flag for 

**Thang 2: Rock Work - 4 rounds consisting of** 

- Run Pickle
- Curls/overhead press/tricep/rock your body

Returning rocks and heading to the Basketball court for:

**Thang 3: Partner Court Work - 4 rounds**

- Court Sprints (lines)
- Balls to Fence/Chair Sit/Dips/Dirkens.

Mozy pickle to flag for Mary 

- Homer To Marge
- American Hammer
- Elbow To Knee (Earhart)

Have a nice day! 

COT with Swag taking us out in prayer.
