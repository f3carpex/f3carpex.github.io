YHC is honored to celebrate my 3 year anniversary in F3 Carpex! Technically it is Monday 3/18, but work, yada yada yada.. The celebration will continue at DZ on 3/22.

Repeato did the 440 EC ruck. Several did the 440 EC run, maybe Largemouth, Build-a-Bear and Ollie.

My nantan, Ma Bell was blasting Back in Black by ACDC as he rolled up. He named me by the way. We welcomed the Krispiest of all Kremes from Hartsville. We circled up and since the nantan was there YHC thought we should give some sort of disclaimer. I then introduced YHC as Hermes, the Greek god of the Olympiad and true hero of the odyssey. Everyone Cheered!

The Warmup:  
Jog around the pickle and the Standard Shut-in warmup. (He's my F3 papa).  
The Thang:  
Walk over to YHC's truck to find some gifts for this AO: 12 4"x8"x16" Concrete Solid Cap Blocks (32lbs ea. for the record). Since we had 13 people, we need to partner up. 150 Curls for girls per partnership, P1 do curls, P2 do mary and flapjack till you get to 150. Same thing for tricep extensions, block rows, and overhead presses. Plank holding after each till the rest of the pax are done. Jog around the pickle.  
The Thang 2:  
Do the same thing as Thang 1, but quantity is 100 of each and squat holding after each.  
We then did some LBCs for good measure.  
Then everyone get a block and lets go find a place to stash them in the woods behind a tree down near the crick and YHC will partially cover with pinestraw.  
Count a rama and Name-a-rama  
Announcements:  
24 Hours of Prayer, F3 Dads this Saturday 9:00 AM at bond park, F3 Dads Camp in August at Camp Seagull,  
Prayer Requests: Callahan's Knee  
YHC took us out in traditional Ball of Man style.

NMS:  
They have big shovel flags in Hartsville.  
Build-a-bear and Bluewater did not break a sweat during this workout.  
YHC did.
