10 HIMs gathered at Koka Booth for the following:

Disclaimer disclaimed, allegiance pledged, and mosey to the biggest, baddest parking lot in all of Cary at 0515 on a Thursday.

### Warm Up

SSHs, Good Mornings, Sir Fazio arm circles forward and back, Moroccan Night Clubs, Calf Stretches, Plank Jacks and Merkins.

### The Thang

Time to play Blackjack. Everything always adds up to 21. Complete 20 Merkins, run the length of the parking lot, and do 1 LBC. Run back, 19 Merkins and LBCs. You get the picture. All to tunes from the AC/DC album Back in Black.

Run out of time so stop at about 7/14 - just enough time to circle up for an encore performance of Back in Black. Do a burpee every time you hear the word Back. That's 33 burpees in about 4 minutes for those who are counting.

Mosey back to the flag

### Mary

PAX choice, Q takes control at the end for 10 CF Merkins.

### COT

2 Respects, 8 Mehs

Announcements, Praises, Prayer requests, Staubach takes us out.

### NMS

That was fun! It was hard, and that's what brings the PAX back out. MIAGD, be a little better today than yesterday.
