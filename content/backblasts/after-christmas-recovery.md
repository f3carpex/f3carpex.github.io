A group of 13 HIMs arrived at FOD for some after Christmas recovery. Crimson and YHC decided that by signing up to Q the day after Christmas was the best way to ensure we’d be up early. We had expected 8 HIMs at most but we’re presently surprised by a strong showing!

At 5:45 plus a few seconds (we gave a few seconds to allow Grinch to join us) we were off towards the top parking lot for:

**Warm up**

\- SSH x 11 (one extra to make sure everyone was paying attention!)

\- Imperial walker x 10

\- Mountain climbers x 10

\- Merkins x 10 OYO

**Thing 1**

Partner up for Dora. 100 x merkins, 200 x LBCs, 300 x squats shared. One partner ran the pickle while other did Dora and flip flop.

Mosey towards the rock pile. Audible to add 5 x burpees at each light pole down the hill for 25 total.

**Thing 2**

Rock work.  Partner one mix of curls, over head press, triceps extensions, and rock rows while other partner ran loop. Flip flop.

**Thing 3**

Head towards shelter for dips, step ups, and derkins. Repeat for 3 sets total.

**Mary**

Crimson took over for some Mary. Mosey back to the flag.

\- 10 x burpees on my down

\- 10 x Peter parkers

\- Chill cut with a 10 count around the circle

\- 20 x box cutters

\- 20 scissor kicks

\- 50 count 6 inch leg lift

\- hi-liter called some side kick thing. Forgot the name because YHC was having a hard time just keeping balance.

**Announcements**:

\- convergence New Year’s Day at A-team start at 07:00.

**Prayers**:

\- aunt in hospice

\- dad test results

**NMS**

Always a pleasure to lead

It wasn’t nearly as cold as for casted but still tried out my new gear. Way over dressed.

Writing this on my new iPad wasn’t nearly as fun as I had anticipated.

the GPS on my Apple Watch worked nicely!

Lets make it a great week focusing on friends and family as we close out the final week of 2017.
