AO: Rush Hour

Date: 5/7/19

PAX: Biner, Disco Duck, Kermit, Theismann, WWW, Skipper (Ruck), O’douls (EC run)

As a personal goal, I try to post atleast 4-6 times a week.  My 2019 goal is to Q atleast once a week.  This week was a busy week for me due to work commitments so I had to double down on Tuesday (FWD & RH).  Disco Duck Q'd FWD; hence, the meaning for the BB title.  There was a lot of burpees this morning and due to me being cray-cray for burpees, I pulled a rinse & repeat in Rush Hour.  Read on for the details.

Once it was time, we completed the F3 admin stuff.  No FNG so off we went to the lower parking deck.  Circle up to warm-up.

Warm-up: Good Afternoons, Abe Vigodas. Hamstring Stretch, Calf Stretch with Merkins, Sir Fazio. Seal Claps.  Not going far from the flag is my normal modus operandi.  As mentioned earlier, I decided on the rinsing and repeating of the DD's FWD workout with a slight change to the exercises.

Thang 1

QIC called 22 with burpees in between Run the parking deck to next level which was the mid-point, 5 burpees, run to next level for plank jacks x21, return to mid-point 5 burpees, return to start for Sumo Squats x1. Repeat and subtract 4 at the top and add 4 at the start. Do three rounds.

Thang 2: Starstruck.  Gotta do this because this is a staple of my workout.  As Theismann and other HIMs mentioned, how do you get better at an exercise, do that exercise all the time.  What I love about burpees is it taxes the whole body.

After Starstruck burpees, the PAX finished the remaining 3 rounds to finish up 22’s.  As we completed, we had some time to do thang 3 with the introduction of  a new song and routine.

Thang 3: The new song is "Unlock the Swag" by Rae Sremmurd.  I heard this song when I was in Myrtle Beach for my daughter's dance convention.  As I was listening to it, it sparked an idea to bring to my Carpex Borthers.  Here is the routine.  You have multiple exercise options to do.  This day, I selected curbkins.  At the word “unlock” in the chorus you do an irkin.  During the song in between the chorus, you can do any movement (i.e. Imperial Walkers, running in place, SSH, etc.).  Once you hear "unlock" you drop down to the curbkin position and  do an irkin until the chorus is complete - 16 total.  When you complete the song, you would have done 67 reps of the exercise.  In the essence of time, we had to cut the song short by 1 chorus to get back to the flag in time for COT.  As we moseyed back to the flag we did count-a-rama and name-a-rama.  At the flag we met up with Skipper who did a ruck and O'Douls who completed a run.

Count-a-rama & Name-a-rama: 1 respect, 5 mehs, 1 hate

Announcements: May 31st Anniversary post (goal is 100 PAX); Crazy and Night Train (see Slack for deets), Odyssee planning in underway, Memorial Day Convergence (see SLack for deets).

BOM:  YHC led us out.

NMS:

I did have a workout planned for RH but when I had the pleasure to experience DD's workout in FWD, I thought it worthy to rinse & repeat.  I thought it was glorious but it was taxing.

It is always a pleasure to lead a bunch of HIMs.

This is Q# 22 for the year.  The goal is to Q a minimum of once a week.
