As the clock approached 0545 only five faces were looking back at me, but they were the faces of absolute STUDS who were expecting a thorough beatdown, and YHC was prepared to deliver. Let's get after it!

**Warm-Up**

Lap around the lot and circle up for side straddle hops, imperial walkers, plank jacks, mountain climbers and standard merkins.

**The Thang**

Mosey over to the baseball field where YHC had placed four cones in the shape of a four leaf clover. Some may have thought it resembled a diamond, but trust me, it was a four leaf clover.

Circle up for 13 burpees, on my down.

Partner up for Dora 2-2-2, one partner runs a lap around the clover while the other knocks out 200 merkins, 200 squats and 200 LBCs.

Circle up for 13 burpees, on my down.

Mosey back out to the parking lot and over to the shelter for double sevens. Run the horseshoe-shaped path from one shelter entrance, around the bathrooms to the other shelter entrance, 12 dips, run back, 2 derkins. Repeato, dropping 2 on one side and adding 2 on the other until we finish with 2 dips and 12 derkins.

**Mary**

Circle up at the flag for dying cock-a-roaches, box cutters, American hammers and Have A Nice Day.

**COT**

**Count-a-rama**:  6 **Name-a-rama**:  2 RESPECTs, 4 meh, 0 HATEs **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for improved health for Chipper's mother and safe travels this weekend as he visits her, prayers for Kubota and his family as they go through the adoption process (support their BBQ fundraiser next Friday), prayers for Crimson's friend and brother-in-law with health issues. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**

Good week for YHC, got to partner up with Chipper twice this week.

McCants Week kicks off on Monday at A-Team, so rest up this weekend.

The Ritter Park outfield was so nice at our Independence Day convergence I just had to get a little more.

The second set of burpees were on Crimson, for clapping during the first set. He knows better.

Strong leadership by Crimson calling the dips and derkins during the double sevens.

The horseshoe around the bathrooms is not perfectly shaped, unless your horse has a messed up foot.

No site Q's meant no Coffee with Oofta or Joe with Joe, but there's a Starbucks in Harris Teeter so YHC joined Chop Block and Crimson there.

Thanks for coming out this morning and letting me lead, you guys are awesome.
