Inspiration for this workout came from the exicon. Wahoo once said that F3 is like recess, and I really enjoyed the competitive nature of F3 baseball. I really wanted something that would keep our heart rate up, but allow bruisers to participate. When Water Wings and Disco Duck requested a 7th inning stretch, I knew this was a good workout.

Started with a quick 1/4 mile mosey and then moved into Warm Up

#### Warm Up:

- Good Mornings (South Wake Style)
- Imperial Walkers
- Sir Fazio Forward
- Sir Fazio Reverse
- Plank Hold
- Runner's Stretch
- Finger Tip Plank Hold

#### Only Thang - F3 Baseball

Four bases were placed about 20 yards apart in a diamond. We split up into four teams. Each team had to complete a combined number of reps and started at a different base. The numbers below are per pax. Once each team reached their starting base, they moved on to the next inning. All the teams pushed hard and got all the way to the 8th inning. I will need to adjust in the future to make the game winnable.
