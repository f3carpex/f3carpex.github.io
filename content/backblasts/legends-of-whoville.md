**AO:** Whoville  
**Workout Date:**  09/01/21  
I’ve been so focused on the August Olympics-themed challenge and Qing the swim workouts in Raleigh that it’s been a hot minute since I attended a good old fashioned boot camp. About five minutes into the workout, it showed.

**Warm Up:**  
State the mission, check for FNGs(0), and give the disclaimer.

Announcements and Prayers

**Naked Moleskin:**  
Good work by all!  
As I mentioned before, it had been two or three weeks since I attended or led a boot camp. I started sucking wind early on the Beast and pretty much burned out on my final round of derkins.  
Synced my workout with Strava and found out that after two laps (one was during my scouting prerun) on the playground loop, I was the Local Legend. I wonder how long that will last?  
This was my ninety-ninth #F3Q21 #2021Challenge Q (one hundred third overall). Next Q is Thursday at Aquaman.
