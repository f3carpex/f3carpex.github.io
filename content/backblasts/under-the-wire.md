“THESE are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as FREEDOM should not be highly rated”

Thomas Paine - The Crisis

Nine men gathered in a circle at Marla Dorrel Park at 0530. This was indeed an F3-sanctioned Flirtin' with Disaster workout. As fate would have it, this would be the final sanctioned FWD for an undetermined amount of time. Of these 9, one FNG was among the PAX. F3 mission was stated, as was the disclaimer. But, we are not professionals.

## Warm Up

SSHs, Sir Fazio arm circles, Steve Earles, mosey to the Cary Church of Christ parking lot, then CF Merkins.

## The Thang

11s from one end of the parking lot to the other. CDDs on one side, jump squats on the other. In the middle, do escalating burpees each time through. Up to 10, then back down to 1.

## Mary

Mosey back to the flag, American Hammers.

## COT

2 Respects, 7 Mehs. Welcome FNG Francois. There is some Hill Challenge, deets on Slack. Prayers for our world, and our neighbors. YHC took us out.

## NMS

- And with that, Carpex officially closed all sites for the immediate future. Last official one for some time.
- It seems Shutty has been EH'ing Francois for some time. It took Lifetime Fitness closing for us to get HIM out. Hope Fern is gonna be ok.
- The Nation has officially suspended Hermes from Twitter for at least 2 weeks.
- There was no flag, but at least 3 F3 shirts in attendance.
- As per usual, we all stood around somewhat awkwardly following COT. Term Paper was the first to make a move to his car. TY4YL
- The hard work of this world will not be done by weak men. Wherever you are, strive to be better today.
