YHC picked up the Q slot for Bounty Hunters and did not have much of a plan so let's just roll with the basics. A solid group of 9, no wait 10 PAX were off at 5:30 sharp towards Thales.

Side note: Frisco first posted at BH in May 2018. YHC had a HC that Frisco was going to attend this morning so a repeat of his first day at Carpex was planned over at Thales. However, he did not show up. Some excuse about work. I donno.
