Got an email while I was up late working. No Riptide, sick M. Well Hermes is out of town so I guess I got the Q! What should I do? I'll think of it in the morning.....

I got there and Termpaper was making comments about Rip not knowing it was at 5:30 and might not show.  I had to let him know he wasn't coming.  He seemed bummed about not toddler swats or partner merkins.  Well, then we were off.

**Warm Up -** Run and circle up by the park for SSH, GM, WMH, Merkins, IW, PJ

**Sevens -** off to the Bridge for sevens up the hill.  Spider Merkins at the bottom and Star jumps at the top.

**Bridge Work -**

- Lunge to the middle run to the end.
- Bear crawl to middle run to the end.
- 20 inch worm merkins run to the end.
- 20 gorilla walks and run to the end.
- 20 Broad jump burpees and run to the end.
- 20 lunge stretches and run to the end.
- 2 accelerators

Run back for some dips, L/R step ups, and derkins
