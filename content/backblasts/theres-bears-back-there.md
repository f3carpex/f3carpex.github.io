It was good for YHC to return to FMJ. The guys that were there the only two other times YHC posted there, and Q’d know the routine. 

Run towards the track,, stop for

- 10 Hill Billies (IC)
- 10 Hackeysacks (IC)
- 10 Cossak Stretch (a.k.a Hey Hey Willy) (IC)
- 10 King David Kick (IC)

Proceed to the track

1 laps Mosey

For the below, AYG means **ALL** you got! 

A little more instruction was given by YHC “Pretend like there’s a bear back there”

“But then I only have to run faster than him” says a PAX

YHC replied “OK, there’s 19 bears, and they don’t share meat. You all have to run”

“If you don’t have to stop and walk after the AYG, then you had more. You need to feel like you're going to merlot after every lap”

The Thang:

- 3x (100m AYG, 300m mosey )
- Stretch a little bit
- 3x (200m AYG, 200m mosey )
- Stretch a little bit

YHC took us out

Hi-liter did some kind of unenjoyable looking thing with a big a$$ sandbag and a ruck. Michelob showed up to keep us company in COT.

Prayers for the eternal memory of Jim, and for speedy healing for Michelob.
