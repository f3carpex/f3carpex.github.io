There weren't Fire-ant Bombs, but there were fire-ants and there were B.O.M.B.S.  14 of the finest Carpex PAX gathered in the Wolverine gloom for a beatdown.  Build-a-Bear, Biner, and PBX enjoyed a three-mile EC from Crema at least until they arrived on site and encountered the fire-ants.

As 5:30 approached, PBX was still in battle with the fireants, three of our far west Cary PAX arrived kind of on time, and no FNGs were present. YHC led the pledge and then moseyed to the Wolverine annex at DDMS.

**Warm Up**

Perhaps due to the fire-ants, or perhaps due to semi on-time arrivals, YHC didn't do the best job of keeping the PAX together to the warm up site.  Eventually, we all made it to the DDMS basketball court for:

- 10 GM IC
- 25 SSH IC
- 25 WWII OMU
- And since our back was already wet, 20 HR-Merkins OMD

**Thang 1**

To the track for ascending B.O.M.B.S.

- 5 Burpees,  Run lap and plank hold for 6
- 5 Burpees, 10 Overhead Clap, Run lap and plank hold for 6
- 5 Burpees, 10 Overhead Clap, 15 Merkins, Run lap and plank hold for 6
- 5 Burpees, 10 Overhead Clap, 15 Merkins, 20 Big Boy, Run lap and plank hold or various other holds for 6
- 5 Burpees, 10 Overhead Clap, 15 Merkins, 20 Big Boy, 25 Squats

 

Franklin started lap 5, but with some flash lightning in the area, YHC decided to form 2 lines for Indian Runs back to the main site and sometimes you need to rein Franklin in.

**Thang 2**

Head to the pavilion for descending dips and erkins

- 20 dips, 20 erkins
- 15 dips, 15 erkins
- 10 dips, 10 erkins
- 5 dips, 5 erkins

**Mary**

Back to the flag for Mary or a little downhill from the flag in an attempt to stay outside of the fire-ant containment area.

- 20 Box Cutters IC
- 20 Hammers lead by Biner IC
- 5 Wolverines called by Rooney OYO.
- Have a nice day

**COT**

Prayers/Praises

- Praises from Pivot for a reunion with long-time good friends over the weekend

- YHC took us out

**NMS**

- YHC doesn't Q a lot, but when he does, it rains
- Hosting a sleep-over for a 12-year old birthday party the night before a Q isn't the best idea.  It definitely affected my EC decision
- Speculation was rampant that Hi-Liter intentionally parked next to the fire-ant hill to catch unsuspecting PAX unaware of the danger.
- Great group this morning and a pleasure to lead.
