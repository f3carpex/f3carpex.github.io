After missing out of Qing for 90 days (I did post up with some IR and typical beat downs) I’m back to checking off a few boxes. With that.. today’s theme was [“I’m not a runner”](http://runadam.run/) and I took the Joe Isuzu approach: I lied.    
  
Arrived early on this brisk birthday to scope out the surroundings as it had been a hot sec since posting here, I wanted to confirm my idea and memory. A short 1 mile EC verified my idea and 22 others HIM joined me at the google maps pin drop to hear the disclaimer and recite the pledge.  
  
“Start your stravas \*& follow me” was mumbled and we mozy’d to Apex United Methodist Church’s parking lot on Elm Street for warmup.

- Good Mornings
- SSH
- Sir Fazios - fwd/backward
- Overhead Claps
- Calf Stretches
- Runners Stretch

**Mozy to corner of Elm and Olive for Thang 1: 9's (modified 7 / 11's)**

- Mountain Climbers
- Star Jumps
- 5 Merkins in the middle

**Mozy to rock pile for partner rock/run for Thang 2: Partner Rock/Run**

- Partner 1: run around church
- Partner 2: curls for girls / overhead press / rows

• Split into 2 groups.

**Mary**

YHC took us out in prayer.

Thanks to ALL of of Carpex as y'all have made me a better and stronger person over the past year. In this regards, I'm not lying! MIAGD!
