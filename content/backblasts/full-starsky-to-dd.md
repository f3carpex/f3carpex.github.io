**NMS**

Arrived at FC about 15 minutes early to refresh myself on lay of the land. The mumblechatter from the track was strong as 2 PAX were engaged in some EC run. Soccer field open and looked like prime place for festivities and there was a nearby parking lot for transition to thang 2.

FNG War Eagle wanted Roll Tide and vehemently protested War Eagle, so it was decided. There was sentiment for Feel Like a Woman after admitting Shania Twain was his first concert, but that was a little bit too weird, even for Carpex. But if he tries to name swap with Crimson, I am reverting to Feel Like A Woman (or maybe just FLAW)

All 14 PAX hit Coffeteria at Dunkin’ Donuts, which suited YHC, as I am one of the few that prefers their coffee to Starbucks.

I had a blast and as always, it was an honor and a pleasure.
