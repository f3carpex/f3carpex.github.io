The Thang

Light Poles - lunge walk to the first pole then 10 tuck jumps, jog to the next, bearcrawl to the next then 10 hand release merkins, jog to the next, and repeat sequence

To the field for some Frisbee throws! Sprint while the frisbee is in the air and do the called exercise until the first person gets the disc to throw it again. We went down the field doing bearcrawls, crab walk, lunges, crawl bear, etc to the end of the field.

Put down some Railroad track on the way back. One person planks and then the next person runs over them five yards and planks. The third person runs over them and so on.

Another round of Frisbee throws and then Indian run on the way back.

Next up was a burpee ladder up the grassy hill. We went up to 5 for the sake of time.

Walk to recover over to the Billy run location. A round of 20 jump lunges, 20 squat jumps, and 20 donkey kicks to make sure the legs were tired.
