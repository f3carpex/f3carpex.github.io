It was a good day for a VQ, thanks to the perfect mix of humidity, heckling, helpful encouragement, and reminders from Shut-In that the things he brought up in Q school were better applied than remembered. Despite lots of "you're starting at SNS?" questions we're off.

Mosey in the unusual direction from the flag, getting started at the ropes course parking lot.

After a brief attempt to keep up appearances by suggesting that Build-a-Bear was passing the test in observing my counting woes, we found the correct combination of pauses and cadences to get going. All were warm.

**Warm-up  
**Good morning  
Side-straddle hop  
Cotton picker  
Windmill  
Calf stretch  
Carolina Anole (don't ask)

**Thang One  
**Four stations around the lot, doing a reverse ladder (remembering that days are now getting shorter): 20-15-10-5  
Jump Squats  
'Mericans  
Jump Lunge  
Burpees

Thing

Despite starting the workout completely drenched in sweat, Parker joined Katniss and Grapenuts to lead the way throughout.

**Thang Two  
**Make our way to the rock pile at Field 7. Once there, listen to a larger-than-usual volume of grumbling about how "they're all hero rocks," "most of these were buried by Noah's flood," and only a single, "demonstration please." Try not-very-successfully to cover up my inability to remember just how many intervals I set up with cones or effective strategies for getting the PAX to partner up.

One partner runs intervals back to the bridge; the other moves through upper-body: curls, overhead press, tricep extension, row. Or do it all at once like Shut-In with the man-maker.

Indian runs back to the obligatory Billy Run spot. Rejoin the runners and ruckers for some Mary.

**COT  
**Includes 32, with YHC bringing us out.

It was a humbling, exciting, and learning experience. Looking forward to next time.
