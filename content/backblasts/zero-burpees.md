**Pre-Blast**

- 10 HIM joined YHC for 2.5ish miles at FWD to do some work. YHC refused to call anything even closely resembling a burpee. YHC succeeded.

**The Warmup**

- Pledge of Allegiance at the flag
- Run up Cary Parkway to 64, cross the street, and run down to the medical plaza for some work.
- Before circling up, perform 40 Quick Feet, Paint the Lines, and 100 Curb Dips.
- Circle up for: GM, Windmills, Cotton Pickers ... and SirFazios until YM gets tired.

****T**he T**hang****

- Esau's Ladder: Perform 5 SSH at each successive light pole up the hill in the lot, returning to the start each time for 5 LBC. Increase by 5 each round. Increase to 40 for a total of 180 each.
- Run back to the flag.
- Stretch.
