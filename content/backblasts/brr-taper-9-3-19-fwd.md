Several for some EC runs. 19 for the main event. A brief cluster disclaimer and mission statement was provided.  
Follow me jog to that Church on the right on the way to Waverly do some warm-ups and stretching.  
Follow me to the Mulkey, no Calyx, no NV5 parking lot entrance for some Monkey Humpers.  
Follow me to the nice pretty area in Waverly Place. Partner up (probably should have just counted 1s and 2s but oh well). 1/2 of pax run up the steps by Shake Shack and back down to us. The other half do some Merkins. Flip Flop. Do this again but go up over the bridge thing and do some Squats.  
Do some other Broga type taper stretching.  
Follow me back down Tryon stopping for some more Broga type taper stretching.  
Follow me back to the flag arriving at precisely 6:15 Am.  
Announcements: 9/11 stairs, Odyssey, Golf Tournament  
Prayer Requests: Greenbow's daughter healing (I think it is Migraine treatment she is undergoing), all those effected by Dorian especially in the Bahamas and a praise for the Speed for Need event yesterday! YHC took us out.  
NMS: great work guys, nice trip to Waverly!
