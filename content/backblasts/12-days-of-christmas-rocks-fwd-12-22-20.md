Announcements: Duck Donut Dash  
Hermes Soap Box Announcement: Sign up to Q! There are 14 people here and assuming there are 14 on average at a workout, then you NEED to Q at least 1 out of 14 workouts that you attend. The math is not that complicated. If you are not Q-ing that much, then you are taking not giving! Don't be that guy.  
  
Prayer Requests:  
\- Greenbow for patience in shoulder healing  
\- Disco Duck and Liverpool for quick Covid recovery  
\- That any man in this circle and in F3 that does not know God has the courage to reach out to one of us that do. And when he does reach out that us broken saved sinners are able to have the conversation in humility and not stumble over our words to much.  
  
NMS:  
\- Callahan was up front with Lookout all morning! Well done said! I take back all those things i said about you.  
\- And no, I have not read the most recent Muggo post yet.  
\- Ya boi Full House is looking awfully svelte these days!  
\- Good to have Mama's Boy cross US1 to come to a workout!  
\- Did yall hear that Chipper did both the 10 mile virtual Oakwood and 10 miles of the actual Oakwood 24?
