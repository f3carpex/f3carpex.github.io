COT

Welcome FNGs Sally and Green River.

Prayers/Praises:

- Sally's new brother in law is having some challenges and he is hoping that it doesn't develop into a long term issue. Hoping his brother in law is able to change his patterns.
- Green River's 2.0s are all sick and his M is going out of town tomorrow. Prayers for speed recovery and succcess with the 2.0s.
- YHC was blessed that two men rolled out of the fartsack and met in the gloom to work our bodies and fellowship together.

NMS:

- F3 solves a problem that many of us didn't know that we had. It is truly a blessing to be part of such a great good that encourages men to be strong leaders in their communities.
- It is awesome to see the growth and YHC is so excited to see F3 expand into St. Louis.
- It was great to be on the Katy trail and exercise with Lewis and Clark (statue) this morning. Reminds me of our history and the great struggles of the United States as we expanded westard. I know that F3 can follow the same path and help all of us create strong communities.
