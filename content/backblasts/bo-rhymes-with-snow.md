**NMS**:

Thing 1 initailly called for squats but YHC modified to fulfill the preblast and give kwikStop the chance to do sleeveless snow angels. Thanks to Cali for taking the Pic.

On the way back down the deck the 2 PAX in front were bombed with snow balls from the slower PAX. YHC believes he saw the ever elusive Meh Bell smile at the time.
