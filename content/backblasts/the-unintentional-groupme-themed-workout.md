### NMS

Lot's I could say here, but you had to be there to here the Hermes/Repeato conversations about Valentine's Day. There were different exercises planned, but the PAX wanted some practice so we included more hips. Time will tell if it helped or hurt. MIAGD, and a little better than yesterday.
