It sure felt like that on the trek to Apex for this morning's romp.

I forget the disclaimer and pledge. I guess I was distraught about not being able to go to toshi station to pick up some power converters. Stupid uncle Owen.

29 of us moseyed to the parking lot for warm-ups

- Han Solo Hops
- Princess Leia Lunges
- Chewbacca Merkins (on my grunt)
- Obi Squat Kenobis
- Imperial Walkers

Leia secured the Death Star plans and was subsequently chased by Darth Vader. She then loaded them onto R2D2 before he was launched in an escape pod and subsequently chased. This sounds a lot like catch me if you can, so we did that with some X-Wing sit ups (on six with legs and arms in x shape, left arm to right leg and down, right arm to left leg and down is 1).

Next we impersonated sand people on our way to the cantina in Mos Eisly to meet Han Solo. Sand people always travel single file to hide their numbers so we did a 'Sand People Run' that seemed very similar to an Indian Run.

Upon arriving at the cantina (thanks to site q @rooney for the proper music) we meet Han Solo who boast that the Millennium Falcon has made the Kessel run in under 12 parsecs. So we do a set of 12s with Peter Parsec Merkins on one side and Death Star Jumps on the other.

We jump on the Millennium Falcon and head to Alderaan. Unfortunately upon our arrival, we see that it has been destroyed by the Death Star and are now stuck in its tractor beam. Grab a partner's shirt as they try and run away, flap Jack and end up back in the Death Star (Apex town hall courtyard)

Now it's time to drop proton B.O.M.B.S down the exhaust vent to blow up the reactor core and cause a chain reaction explosion. Run down trench and perform 5 each of Burpees, OH Clap, Merkins, Big boy sit-ups, and Squats. Our first attempt was unsuccessful, so we tried again, this time we used the force and blew up the Death Star!! Yay!

Head back to the rebel base on Yavin to celebrate with non themed Mary.
