Eleven HIMs gathered in the fairly well lit, narrow parking lot of Annie Jones Park expecting a limited-run boot camp workout. This is, in fact, what was to be delivered to said PAX.

First exercise, the Pledge of Allegiance. In a well-disguised foreshadowing of things to come, a high knee/karaoke mosey to the lot next to the tennis courts for...

### Warm Up

SSHs, Good Mornings, Moroccan Night Clubs, Overhead Claps, Plank Jacks & Control Freak Merkins.

### The Thang

Move quickly to the far end of the tennis courts. Six courts, and about 40 minutes left to cover that ground with NO RUNNING.

Court 1: Tiny 7s - Fluttering Supermans & Burpees - Bear crawl/Crawl bear

Court 2: Captain Thor - the Ab cousin of Jack Webb

Court 3: Tiny 7s - Squat jumps & Merkins - Crab walk/walk crab

Court 4: Roxanne - Jog in place, burpee at each time the Police sing "Roxanne"

Court 5: Tiny 7s - LBCs & Merkins - Lunge walk

Court 6: BTTW Indian run 1 round

Backwards run to the flag.

### Mary

Have a nice day.

### COT

YHC took us out in prayer

### NMS

The moon was bright, and the birds were chirping. Great morning to get after it. My Garmin had us at 0.62 miles, a bit more than I was hoping. You don't have to run to get the heart rate up, amirite?

Saban is a great timekeeper. Thanks bro!

There are 26 instances of "Roxanne" in the lyrics of Roxanne. Roxanne was not there.

We did burpees, merkins and bear crawls. All of my favorites. Make it a great day!
