June 12, 2017 The Twitter machine for today's FOD workout kicked off early yesterday with a PBX call out for deliverance. Funny how karma works. YHC played along and immediately took the Q spot at #F3RushHour, dueling Banjo Qs in one day.

Yes it is time for deliverance. The line has been drawn between the sedate city lifestyle and the unpredictability of the rural margin. Deadly weapons remained at home but the dueling Banjo Qs began in earnest at FOD.

Countoff in ones and twos

10 Burpee's oyo

17 pax with 1 FNG Napster: Brosef, Bones, Biner, Compound W, Goose, Katniss, Kilmer, Lulu, Ma Bell, Nature Boy, Napster, Open Out, PBX, Snots, Sky Blue, Van Winkle, Banjo

Prayer concerns: Van Winkle and Young life camp trip, Franklins son Andrew and his ride across America, those graduating and making wise decisions, Brosef heading to App State

Announcements: F3 dads this Saturday at 8 AM, park at the community center and meet at the kiosk. Phoenix will start at 6:30.

YHC Took us out, asking the big Q in the sky to help each and every man to be more present.

NMS How awesome is it that another man, besides WWW, found F3 on the Internet. Napster needed some Spartan training and headed our way. Starting with Burpee's is always a crowdpleaser, especially with Nature Boy Speaking of Nature Boy, thank you for untucking your shirt. Speaking of Nature Boy, can I get a Whoooo for calling out windmills? Ma Bell seems to have a hard time with the OYO warm up of good mornings and windmills. YHC has learned that this is an excellent opportunity to ask the pax questions and then just listen. I doubt he knew that Van Winkle was headed to Asheville to do some theological studies or that he was going on a young life camp trip this summer. Or that Brosef was heading off to App State as a recent high school graduate. It's all about being present. Kilmer expressed his concern for YHCs lack of imagination this am. YHC imagined that everyone got what they needed and more. Open Out made a stop by the creeper van and picked up some toys for Bounty Hunters.
