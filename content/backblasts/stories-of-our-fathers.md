NMS.Telling stories is one of the most powerful means that we have to influence, teach, and inspire. Storytelling forges connections among people, and between people and ideas. Stories convey the culture, history, and values that unite us. Stories teach us about life, about ourselves and about others. It gives us an opportunity to learn from another person's experience and it can shape, strengthen or challenge our opinions and values. Through stories we are more engaged and attentive, we are more likely to understand the message and meaning within.
