Three awesome studs in tanktops and ten plain old regular dudes in sleeves showed up at Olive Chapel Elementary despite the chilly conditions.

**Warm-Up** No flag so mosey down to the park and circle up for the Pledge and a few other execises, including ten burpees to remind our sleevy brothers what day it is.

**The Thang** Head over to the shelter for five rounds of 10 irkins, 10 dips, 10 step-ups and a lap around the pickle.

Head out to the parking lot for Smoked Wings, bear crawl from curb to curb, 25 merkins, bear crawl back, 25 dry docks, repeato dropping by 5 each round.

Repeato with Smoked Legs, lunge walk from curb to curb, with squats on one side and quick feet on the other.

Mosey back to where the flag is supposed to be, stopping along the way for Smoked Bellies, 25 LBCs, 20 Homer-to-Marge, 15 Freddie Mercury, 10 box cutters and 5 burpees.

**Mary** Just enough time for dying cock-a-roaches and Have A Nice Day.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  13 **Name-a-rama**:  3 RESPECT, 10 meh, 0 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for Saban, his FIL and their family, prayers for Crimson. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**  I stole the Smoked Wings/Legs/Bellies thing from a guy in Florida.

I should've let him keep it, it sucked.

Except for the groans it brought from the pax.

Love you guys!
