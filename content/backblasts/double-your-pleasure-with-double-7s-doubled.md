Two years ago I was introduced to F3 and it has become one of the top 10 most impactful relationships on my life to include all people and organizations I have been a part of. You HIM have encouraged and spurred me on to be more in all three Fs than I could have ever imagined becoming. It is with a heart of gratitude that I embark on this week of 7 Qs as I hope to give back to those who have given to me and encourage those who are just beginning their f3 journey.

The crowd kept multiplying until alas 27 pax stood ready to start their week off strong in the 36 degree gloom. The F3 mission was shared, a disclaimer was said, there was an FNG, we Pledged our Allegiance and then a "Follow me".

Warm up - All in repetitions of 10 - Side Straddle Hop, Steve Earle, Hello Dolly, Australian Snow Angels, Dive Bombers, Good Morning

Thang 1 - Double 7s Double- The math isn't hard but you have to pay attention. Partner up. Partner 1 runs one direction to the pull up bar for 12 pull-ups, Partner 2 runs the other direction to the hand railing for 12 Underdogs, both return the center for 2 kettlebell swings. Flapjack. Continue in the same fashion as 7s but in multiples of 2.

Thang 2 - Quarter Mile Partner Carry - As fun as it sounds! Switch as often as needed but you and your partner will take turns carrying the other for .25 miles. 50 Kettlebell swings each at the end.

Thang 3 - Self Destruct - This a timed event. 60 seconds of Burpos OYO. Push yourself to your max! It's you against you. We even listened to a Spartan motivational speech while resting in the plank position to mentally prepare ourselves.

COT - Welcome FNG Pumpkin Eater!

Thank you for the hot minty coffee Wahoo/Yahoo!
