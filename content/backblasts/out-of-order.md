17 PAX trickled into Marla Dorrell park through the thick and chunky atmosphere to join YHC for some exercise this morning. Here's what we did!

Gather at the flag for disclaimer and the F3 mission... and follow me. No FNG check, because everyone looks at least vaguely familiar. Into the park we go...

Warmup at the inner lot (8cGM, SSH, SM, IW) and follow me into the playground for a micro-Dora with a partner (50x Merkins, Squats, LBCs). Follow me back out of the park and down the greenway to the bridge. Stop halfway for some more Squats and LBCs. Lungewalk for a minute on the way up the hill to the bridge. Mosey across the bridge for Thang 1.

Thang 1

7s on the winding hill. CDD at the top, WW2 at the bottom. Recover at the top, and do an FNG check. We have one!!!

Thang 2

Indigenous People's Bear Crawl across the bridge. We made it all the way across!

Follow me back to the halfway point for some Freddy Mercs and some BBSU. Back through the lot to the rock pile for C4G, OP, TE, RR, and RYBs. Mosey to the flag.

2 minutes of Mary featuring American Hammers and WW2s, courtesy Augmented. HAND and that's it!

Somewhere in those 7s, Augmented alerted me that we had an FNG. It's been almost three months since I Q'd last, so I guess that's about how long it takes to completely forget to check for FNGs at the beginning. I think what was actually at play there was that FWD is the closest AO to my house, but is still only my 3rd/4th most posted spot, so there always seems to be PAX I don't recognize here. Need to get better.

I pre-blasted that there could be Q merlot today. I did get close about 2 times. Also need to get better there, since only YOU can make you merlot.

Great to meet IC Light. I only now am making the 'Iron City' connection in that beer's name. Solid work on that name, Chipper. If only I had spent more beer-drinking days in the 412.

Fun times y'all. This is a great little AO at the bottom of all the hills. Nowhere to go but up today! MIAGD.
