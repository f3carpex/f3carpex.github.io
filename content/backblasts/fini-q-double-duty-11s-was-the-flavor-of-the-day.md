Tortoise’s anniversary is coming up on Feb 2, 2019. Crimson approached me last week to discuss the plan via Slack. He actually twisted my arm saying since the anniversary is coming up, we should Q the rest of the Wednesdays until we have the changing of the guard. In addition, we also need to Site Q shop to find our replacements. As the leader Crimson is, he told me I was Q’ing on 1/23. Just kidding … he did asked nicely and I gladly accepted. Today is my fini-Q as the Co-Site Q for Tortoises. This was bittersweet because Tortoises is a great AO to be a Site Q for. Crimson and I did not have to twist anyone’s arm to Q. We had a line out the door and around the neighborhood waiting to Q the \*\*\*BEST\*\*\* AO in Carpex.

The weather was a beautiful and balmy 32⁰ F. It was a lot warmer than Monday and Tuesday which were in the teens. Last night, Sub pre-blasted ECP with a run around the pickle (Theismann gave him props because he kicked it up a notch – dang over achievers). Yogi and FNG did an EC walk before start. Crimson, Sooey, & Hotty Toddy did a short EC run to get the blood flowing. 0530 start – FNG announcement (we did have 1) and disclaimer. Pledge to Old Glory and off we went to the front parking lot to warm-up.

Warm-up: GM, hamstring stretch, runner’s stretch, calf stretch, Control Freak Merkins (need to add this to the F3 lexicon), mountain climbers, plank jacks, Sir Fazios. I was not sure but during the stretching I did not hear as much mumblechatter. All I heard was a bunch of grown men moaning in ecstasy. That was weird.

After our warm-up, we moseyed over to the back of the business building at the bottom of the hill for the thang. Before the start of the thang, I directed the PAX to stay to the right when running/walking.

Thang: Double Duty 11’s: Hill 1 – Burpees at the top, lunges (left-right) at the bottom. Transition to Hill 2: Catalina Wine Makers at the top, squats at the bottom. I attempted to do this exact program during my Birthday Q week but too much icy caused me to modify for the sake of PAX safety.

After we completed the thang, we had less than 2 mins to get back to the flag. With 30 secs left to spare, we circled up to squeeze in some Mary.

Mary: 100s, Have a Nice Day

COT:

Count-a-rama: 26

Name-a-rama: 8 respects, 18 mehs

Announcements: Krispy Kreme Challenge, Saturday run option in Raleigh led by Yogi.

Prayers / Praises: Aushfahrt’s recovery from his accident, Swag’s M’s recovery, Water Wing’s and Goose’s 2.0’s recovery from surgery.

BOM: YHC took us out.

NMS:

Tortoises anniversary is coming up Feb 2, 2019. Yogi will be QIC. We will also have some bagels and beverages in celebration.

Crimson will do his fini-Q next week. Be there to support him!

After a weeklong of Site-Q shopping, we have 2 HIMs who has accepted proudly to replace Crimson and I as the Q’s for Tortoises. Crimson and I will do a changing of the guard with a formal passing of the shovel flag to Ezekiel and Intimidator.

The moaning in ecstasy was because of the stretching we did before starting the workout. This is something we need to do more. It really helps with preventing pulled muscles.

THANK YOU for allowing me to Q for you all this AM. It was a pleasure to lead you all in the workout. You all are what makes F3 so AWESOME! God bless you and continue to give your support to Ezekiel and Intimidator.
