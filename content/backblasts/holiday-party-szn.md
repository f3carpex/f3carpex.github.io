9 gloom-warriors joined YHC for some holiday fun around DTC. I threw out an invitation on slack for the gents to wear their favorite ugly xmas sweater, with the best(worst) dressed winning a door prize (which would have been a single 12oz bottle of Cold Mountain). Alas, I was the only jackass to dress up for the occasion. Oh well, not the first time I've looked like an idiot, and certainly won't be the last. (When's the Carpex Christmas party, again? I've got some prep work to do.)

Disclaimer(ish) given, lehs go!

## NMS

Man, been a damned minute since I Q'd. You wanna know a little behind the scenes secret about Q'ing? It's like riding a bike. The faster you go, the easier it is to stay balanced. Wait...that's not it. Well, whatever, you get the point.

Anyway, it felt just like old times. I had a loose idea of what I wanted to do, but when it came to calling out the specifics (hmm...dirkins or dips? Why not both!), I crowd-sourced the task. It's easy to lead when you have good followers.

Last week was an old-school BO, with the likes of Riptide and Ma Bell and PBX and Coney and Shutty and myself, along with a few others I can't remember b/c the Q is too lazy to write a backblast….

  
(side note: I can already hear Riptide angrily typing his rebuttal - "sOmE oF Us hAvE JoBs AnD dOn'T hAvE tImE tO wRiTe BaCkBlAsTs LiKe U hIpPiE MILLENNIALS!!!!!" Calm down, boo)

All that said, 'twas a good morn indeed.

I hadn't seen a few of these jabronis in a hot minute, so I enjoyed catching up with the homie Compound W. Press on and Porch are staples at BO, but I always appreciate their dedication. How How was almost unrecognizable, what with the beard coming in nicely and a leaner figure than a few months ago. Greenbow and Loom always bring a smile and a positive attitude. I'm not sure I'm ever seen either of those guys in a poor mood. Their joy is contagious. I don't know Hoppin' John very well, but I did google his name and hooboy, you could have given me 2 million guesses as to what "hoppin john" was and I don't think I ever would have come up with peas and rice. I'm intrigued about how he received his name now. Coxswain was later than the prom queen 5 weeks after the big dance. But what else is new. And finally, Chipper. I'm tellin' ya, for a RESPECT, this dude can move. Always doing EC, always pushing harder. It's something I aspire to and I'm thankful for his example.  

Thanks for allowing me to lead this morning, it was a good time. And sorry for the prom queen comment. That may have crossed a line or two. I'm a work in progress.
