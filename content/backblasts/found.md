SSH, Imperial walker, good morning, cotton picker.  Recover and head back to the gate to pick up Honeycomb, Disco Duck and FNG. 10 burpees and hill billys.

Done. Welcome FNG Magellan, Jack a friend of Honeycomb, a Carpenter, who can’t seem to find his way to the AO on time.

Circle up for COT: prayers to the eighth grader Skyler who passed away this past Friday due to complications from the flu. YHC took us out. Prayers for Crimson's in laws

After spending 48 hours over the weekend at church with a Discovery youth retreat, YHC was moved by several youth who, going into the weekend, were on the fringe, likely marginalized. They emerged from the weekend feeling the love of each of the other youth and adults present, feeling a new Hope and love with Christ. All in all it was very moving. The pax were encouraged to listen to their youth, be present, aware, encouraging.
