Every now and again, you say something that is mean or hurtful or just plain not nice. Today was one of those days.

Ten guys got together this morning at Hunter Street Park expecting 45 minutes of what F3 does best: joyful camaraderie.

Instead, an ill-tempered roast busted out.

And YHC is squarely to blame.

After a mosey the long way around to the lady's parking lot, we warmed up with some SSHs, Burt Jacks, Merkins, Plank Jacks, Supermen and some other stuff. Kind banter of the masculine type ensued. Some PAX (YHC included) noted how our hammies were definitely sore. Something about some [hill sprints](https://f3carpex.com/2021/03/04/quickies-by-st-marys/) I guess. Words of concern were shared and the left able-bodied of us were gently consoled.

Warm-up complete and in merry spirits, the cadre of comrades performed some agility along the parking lot.

And that's when it happened. Our merriment was punctured when, a propos of nothing, the youngest among us noted how "We did this yesterday at SNS."

Hm, that's strange - thought I. Whence comes this ill manneredness?

I had not see a BB from said workout. And even though Flip Flop's Q's have less variety than the grocery isle at a Dollar General, how was I supposed to know the stand-in Q would pre-copy my perfectly planned beatdown?

But I swallowed my price and continued on. The main event beckoned.

The PAX were asked to count off in 1s and 2s. After a few false starts with a "3" or a "4" thrown in, the PAX were divided and a lamost-but-not-quite perfect set of instructions for a team Dora were called:

- 100 Burpees
- 200 LBCs IC
- 300 Dips IC

But despite nine PAX understanding my intent even if the words weren't perfect, that same whippersnapper mouthed off again. Something about his butt and the instructions being a sham.

It was then that I snapped.

As the first group gorilla hopped across the parking lot, fli-flopping at the start while the other group did something (oblique crunches and the like), that's when I said it. I'm not proud. In fact, as soon as I said it, I felt bad.

We finished our workout in complete silence, each PAX thinking about the disappointing showing from the QIC. Tsk tsk. I'm not proud of it. And I apologize.
