60 degrees. Dry. No wind.

15 dudes. 5 or 6 for EC run.

Burt subbing for Half (get well, bro) on the Q

Disclaimer, Mission, Safety were covered

**Warm Up**

Prisoner run to the big (dark...property mangers please reset your timers on DST Sunday) parking lot. Circle up for squats, Merkins with calf stretch, SSH, Hillbillies, Burt Jacks (perhaps we will do Burt Jack Webb’s at some point), Good Mornings. Most on Cadence, some on down and one on a down and up call. 15 count was the norm with a side of cluster.

**Thang**

Moving Parking Lot Prisoner Run Jack Webb’s. Up to 11 Merkins and 44 (David Thompson) Hallelujahs while getting in some mileage in the lot.

Move to the Hill for Plyo 7s. Jump squats and Jump Tuck Knee Ups. We did them together and we also did one run running Sean D Clair style with arms a flying.

Stay on the Hill for a Man Maker Pyramid up to 4 Man Makers. With each progression we did a manmaker with increasing counts at each pole and at each stop the same count of Merkins, plank jacks and jumps inside of the manmaker. So at 2...we did 2 MM’s...each with....2 Merkins, 2 PJ,s, 2 Merkins and 2 jumps ...we did them up to 4 while sprinting between poles. Hell I am even confused. Trust me on this one.

One more Jack Webb (12 and 48) before Prisoner Running back to the Lot (TOC had the lights on) for the last Jack Webb (13 and 52).

Circle up for American Hammers x 20

**COT**

Count, names, announcements, prayers (Old Maid’s and Hi Liters 2.0s).

Bible Verse: Whatever you have done to the very least of my brothers, you have done to me. Matthew 25 31-46

Always nice to lead you men. Always a better man after a morning with my F3 pals. Glad I could help my friend Half.

Nice shirt this am. Peeping Tom (Superman - Kryptonite). Nice shirt this am. Flip...Burt HS picture.

We ran 1.6 miles. Most guys were gassed.

Prisoner runs were for Half....he loves them.

Coffee was awesome...thanks WB

Oofta (Original Java Q) pulled a Starsky on his Bike.

Sean D Clair has a bed to sell.

Hello Kitty called Dredd from the Car about my Cluster Q after he posted the Old Maid PUT6. Which is good BTW.

Later, Burt
