It was raining and windy as pax converged at the flags planted by the EC runners at NCMA.

Fava, like a pro, ran us to the parking deck where he clearly had a beatdown ready to throwdown.

**The Thang:**  
We did a Beast,  
We did 3 sets of 7 by 7s (Chad had difficulty)  
We did wind sprints with a burppe ladder  
We did a ladder up the deck stopping for knee tucks and star jumps  
We ran back to the flag and called it a morning.

**NMS:** 10 Carpex 6 Raleigh (Grease pointed out). Last 4 backblasts (not including this one) **[were all written by Michelob](https://f3raleigh.com/tag/whiplash)**. Welcome to your new home for Whiplash BBs
