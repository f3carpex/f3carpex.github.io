31! This has been some kind of week, so just like I did in my preparation I'm going to keep it brief.

Mostly recycled my [May the H8th](https://f3carpex.com/2018/05/08/ode-to-the-hate/) workout from last year (thank you, longevity). Here's what we did this time:

FNG Check / F3 Mission Statement / FOLLOW ME into the park

Quick figure 8 through the playground, and back to the inner lot for:  
GM // SSH // TT // 31SM  
FOLLOW ME out of the park.

Turn right on Thurston, turn right on Cary Parkway. Gather across from PPP for  
THE [MILLENNIAL](https://f3nation.com/exercises/):

As a group, the PAX will run down the hill behind Parkway Professional Park (approx 100 yards). We’ll do an OYO exercise until someone reaches 100, and then head back up the hill to do another exercise until someone reaches 100. Repeato until we hit the burpees. The exercises are stuff like:  
Prisoner Squats / LBCs / Sumo Squats / American Hammers / Merkins / WW2s / Quick Feet

end with 6 Burpees OMD (to hit >100 collectively), and lets mosey back to the flag, nay, to the rock pile

20 each of C4G/OP/TE/RR followed by 15 of each of those. Mosey back to the flag.

Have a nice day and THAT'S IT!

I was super encouraged to be in the gloom this week with y'all. I'd been out for almost 4 weeks with out-of-towns and an overworked ankle. Probably slowgoing from here, but we'll see.

Thanks for helping me kick off year #32 with a boom! Blessed by you all.
