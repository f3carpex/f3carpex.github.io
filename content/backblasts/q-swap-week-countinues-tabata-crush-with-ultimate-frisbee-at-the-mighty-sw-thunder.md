I got the call from HOTY 2018 and 1stF Q Disco Duck asking if I wanted to Q Thunder during Q Swap Week with our SW Brothers. I emphatically said ABSOLUTELY YES!!! The day and time was not an issue with me because I will take every and advantage to Q a workout. I've never Q'd at Thunder before so I made it a point to attend a Thunder Q before said date. I went the week prior to my Q and John Deere was the Q. We played with tractor tires that were 220#+, a PVC pipe filled with water, sledgehammer, and some crazy weight stick wrapped in duct tape. Bottom line: It was a blast but tough workout.

Here is my take away with a workout at this time. I get a workout in before hitting the sack at the end of the day.

As I contemplate what I want to do, I pulled out one of my favorite routines ... tabata with pain stations. Additionally, I wanted to have some fun with it and since Thunder is held at one of the largest sports parks in Wake County, I also wanted to play one of my favorite F3 sport (Ultimate Frisbee).

Since I Q'd a lot last year and experienced routines and exercises from multiple Q's since my start of F3, I have made a list of my favorites. Here is what we did:

No FNG. We got the F3-ministration stuff out of the way and we Pledged Our Allegiance to Old Glory, it was time to get rolling. We moseyed over to the baseball field parking lot, which by the way was without any lighting other than the glow of the already existing lighting from the soccer and baseball fields. It looked alright when I did my walk through to set-up my weinkees. Yes I still do weinkees and you'll understand why. When you have a tabata routine with 5 stations and multiple rounds, its hard to keep up with all the exercises. So no pride here, a weinkee it is to keep things straight.

Warm-up: SSH, Sir Fazio, seal clap, overhead clap, Moroccan nightclubs, calf stretch, and last but not least, Eskimo merkins to 13.

QIC had the PAX count of 1-5. Each number representing what station to start at in the thang. QIC also had PAX 3 & 5 get an ego rock to take with them to their station. They will leave it at the station upon completion of the time.

After round 1, run around the pickle twice and back to your starting station for round 2.

After round 2, run around the pickle and back to the starting point for thang 2.

Thang 2: Ultimate Frisbee.

Here is the thing about where we played. Womble Park is an extremely busy park which I mistakenly thought a field was going to open up (NOT). I had to figure out a back-up plan. I was not giving up on ending the workout with some Ultimate Frisbee. I found a decent size area right next to the tennis courts which we utilized effectively. It will do. We played Ultimate Frisbee for 23 mins closing out the workout. Rules: Dropped Frisbee (closest PAX calls a 10 count exercise); if a team scores, winners do 10 merkins and losers do 7 burpees. We did lots of stuff and each side scored a touchdown.

No Mary done today.
