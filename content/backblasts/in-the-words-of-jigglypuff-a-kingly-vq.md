I almost spilled Merlot during my VQ. I knew I wanted my VQ to be the week of my 30th birthday and no better way to send Kyrie back off to Marine Pilot school than to try to give his Marine boot camp a run for it's money (yeah right). Accomplishment Adrenaline.

**The Warm Up**

The Pledge of Allegiance. Mosey over to the FM parking lot for the warm up which included a little bit of Good Mornings, Side Straddle Hops, Imperial Walkers, Hillbillies, Merkins and LBCs.

**That Thang**

Mosey over to the shopping center, past Bocci and down the stairs into the adjacent parking lot. Let's partner up. Dora with partner: 100 Merkins of your choice (not standard), 200 Squats of your choice, 300 Abs of your choice (not LBCs). Lunge up the stairs, Karaoke to center, reverse Karaoke to parking lot and mosey on back to relieve your partner. That didn't take up all the time so on the fly we did some stair circuits that included high knees, burpees and back peddling. A quick 'have a nice day' to catch a breath, 33 LBCs and l then mosey on back over to the flag. 33 counts were popular today, it did have significance.

**COT**

**Count-a-rama**:  15 **Name-a-rama**:  1 RESPECT, 15 total PAX/HIMs at the SWW HIZ **BOM**:  Mufasa: Prayers and Praises for Callahan's 2.0 and M. Prayers for those impacted by the recent storms and some thankfulness for what our Good Good Father continues to bless us with.

**Announcements:** I am sure they were important but I forgot them as I am writing this 3 days after it happened (collision learning and almost a petino but I may be forgiven this time).

It was an absolute pleasure and a humbling experience to lead these men who are far greater men than me. I appreciate all of you. You have made me stronger.

I'll be right back.
