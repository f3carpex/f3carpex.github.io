Snatched the Q from Denali in my efforts to knock out a few first time 2018 Qs down the stretch . He challenged me to do glow sticks in a similar vein to what went down at the Judge a couple of weeks ago. I was excited about it, but dreading the extra early alarm, especially since I wasn’t exactly sure how long it would take to set it up.

Didn’t want to disappoint my fans after being featured onPick Up the 6 Pack, so also planned tunes for the Shelter work. Theme was HipHop/Nu Metal. Most popular song was definitely Yeah. Apologize if any were offended for explicit lyrics in several songs

Thanks to all of the Pax for encouraging words throughout and hope all had a good time. Always an honor to lead.
