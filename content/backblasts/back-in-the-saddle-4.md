**Workout Date:** 04/26/21  
YHC took a vacation road trip for a family wedding the week after March Madness. I had looked up some DR AOs, but ultimately just took vacation. Getting back to posting in April after that was difficult. I posted twice the entire two weeks after vacation. I decided I needed to Q to get myself out of the fart sack (and to get back on pace with my personal Q challenge). Hell’s Bells was open. I figured if I’ve Q’d The Blitz, I could Q another kettlebell workout, so I signed up.

**Warm Up:**  
Give the mission statement, check for FNGs, give the disclaimer, and warm up:  
Side Straddle Hop x20 In Cadence (IC)  
Good Morning x10 IC  
Imperial Walker x20 IC  
Sir Fazio Arm Circles x10 IC Forward x10 IC Reverse  
Monkey Humpers x10 IC  
Standard Merkins x10 On My Down (OMD)  
Mountain Climbers x10 IC  
Downward Dog with calf isolation stretches  
World’s Greatest Stretch

**Main Event**  
**1)** Everyone grab a kettlebell and partner up for a **Dora 1-2-3** of Chest Press x100, KB Little Baby Crunches x200, Squat Thrusters x300. Runners run to the second light pole and back  
**2)** With only 6 PAX, my plan to split into five groups like we do at the Blitz wouldn’t work, so we just circled up for various KB exercises: KB Swings, Snatches, Single Leg Dead Lifts, Overhead Press, Single Arm Bent Over Rows, Curls, and Triceps Extensions

**Mary:**  
Kettlebell Mary: American Hammers, Flutter Kicks, KB Taps (Nipplers but instead of tapping your nipples, you tap the KB on the ground in front of you)

**COT:**  
6 PAX  
Freed to Bleed Saturday, F3 Wendell starts Saturday, Raleigh Day of Service 6/19  
Multiple prayers.  
Someone took us out. Cobains for my bad memory/notes.

**Naked Moleskin:**  
I believe I overheard Banjo say he picked me when he was Q shopping, so I’ve got that going for me. Truly, it was nice to hear.  
T-claps to Banjo for partnering with me on Dora so that I would be running with a PAX I did not know (Earhart). Good 2nd F getting to know him.  
Hell’s Bells is a great AO, with a good selection of kettlebells and other assorted toys, plus on-site coffeeteria (5 PAX today). I hope to be back soon!  
This was my thirtieth #F3Q21 #2021Challenge Q. Next Q is tomorrow at Bandwidth.
