Great to lead these HIM this morning. I did a little research prior to theming my Q and can't speak for ANY Native Americans, but what I found was that the "Indian Run" was named after them due to the procedure they leveraged around their tribal celebration.

That said I'm planning to donate to the Native American Heritage Association on behalf of all HIM's present this morning and I encourage you to do your part as well.
