Back to Tortoise, where it all started. At the church formerly known as Sovereign Grace, YHC runs the 1.8 miles in early to get some pull-ups. Very soon, PAX started to arrive and gather 'round the flag. It's a cold, sleevy morning in the POGL. Even Ma Bell has the pythons covered for this 27 degree workout. First exercise, Pledge of Allegiance.

## Warm Up

Lap around the parking lot, circle up for SSHs, Sir Fazio arm circles, Steve Earles, a single Good Morning led by Crimson, Grundle stretch and calf stretch.

Finish it off with a Tortoise favorite, Jack Webbs up to 10:40

## The Thang

Partner up with a Dora. Classic 100 Merkins, 200 LBCs, 300 Squats. Other partner runs to the pullup bars and completes 5 pull-ups. Once complete everyone back to the pull-up bars for one last set.

Keep your partners, mosey to the wall on the side of the church. Partner 1 completes 20 Dying Cockroaches, while Partner 2 holds BTTW. Rotate for 1 set each.

## Mary

Captain Thor up to 10:40. Disco Duck calls 10 Burpees on his down. YHC finishes off with Homer 2 Marge, Pickle Pounders, and Pamela Andersons. Have a nice day.

## COT

Several respects in attendance, the rest Mehs. Praises for Roasters' return to the gloom. He's got a new kid! Prayers for Disco's MIL and Kelly, Crimson's sister battling addiction, and Gnarly Goat's loss of his best friend. YHC took us out.

## NMS

- Limited run, unlimited pain
- Ma Bell is good at counting. Get well soon Ma, the boot don't suit ya
- Sooey stayed in the car as long as he could, some said it was cold
- Crimson performed his single Good Morning like the professional he is
- We had a Hello Kitty fly by. He dropped in for a couple Dora sets, then continued his run.
- We celebrated the return of Roasters, and prayed for that next guy who needs F3, but doesn't even know it yet.
- MIAGD, and be just a little bit better today than you were yesterday.
