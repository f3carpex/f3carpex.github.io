As YHC has not attending a workout at Claymore more than a handful of times, he along with One Direction forgot its a 5:45 start. That being said a few warm up laps around parking lot killed the extra time.

Beginning at 5:45, I a call for FNGS was made with no reply. With no flag in site.. we mozyâ€™d pickle as then a site-q arrived with a flag. Stopped for pledge and then continued to other parking lot for **warmups**

- Good morning
- Sir Fazio (forward and reverse),
- Seal claps
- Over head clap
- Calf Stretch
- SSH
- Imperial Walkers

Mozy to rocks

Thang 1: Rock Work

- curls
- presses
- tricep extension
- When done run pickle.

Repeated 3x increased in counts. Complaining on lightness of some rocks, YHC called audible to have HIM move 1 rock clockwise between exercises. Somewhere in there 5 penalty burpees.(OYO) was called for late flag arrival.

Thang 2: Doras

- 100 Merkins
- 200 Squats
- 300 LBCS
- Partner to run pickle.

Thang 3 - Tennis courts

- round 1: rotating between bear crawls and lunge walks across courts
- round 2: crab walk entire width of all courts.
- Peoples Chair - 10 count down the pax.

Mozy to flag for Mary

- American Hammers
- Scooba Budda

Have a nice day
