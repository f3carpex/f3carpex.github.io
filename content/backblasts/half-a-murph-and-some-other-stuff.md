YHC was joined by 14 PAX full of mumble-chatter in the slightly-warmer-than-yesterday but still right at freezing gloom, and some traveled outside their normal AOs to cheer me on for my solo VQ.  Much appreciated.  Having already known _someone_ who spilled merlot during a co-VQ…er…let’s just say that was out of the way so one less thing to be nervous about.  No FNG’s, so off we go.

15 PAX took a brisk jog around the lower parking lot and circled up in the shelter parking lot for:

- SSH x 20 IC
- Plank Jack x 20 IC
- Mountain Climber x 20 IC
- Good Morning x 10 IC
- Merkin x 20 IC

Wait…what’s that I see?  An Angry Elf citing to make us an even 16 PAX?  Not to be called out as soft on my VQ, so

- 10 Penalty Burpees OYO

### Thang 1

Mosey to the shelter and partner up.  Each partner does:

- Pull-ups x 50 OYO (partner assist as needed, make sure you do ‘em all)
- Merkins x 100 OYO

Mumble chatter was swift to commence, with clarification needed on whether that was _each_ and not _total,_ and gentle suggestions that squats may be better paired well with Pull-Ups, something about half-a-Murph, yaddah, yaddah, so YHC figured we were getting somewhere.  Hi-Liter led the PAX who finished in one round of Mary while we wait for the six.

### Mosey to the Field for Thang 2:

A set of five full-field AYG sprints was the main event, punctuated with exercises at each end, a few 10-count breaks, and a mosey back to the start…lather rinse repeat x 5.  Went something like this:

- Full Field AYG
- 4-count Jump Lunges x10 IC
- Karaoke to start (switch halfway)
- Freddie Mercs x 20 IC
- (10 count)
- Full Field AYG #2
- 30 second People’s Chair
- Backwards Run to start
- Boxcutter x20 IC
- (10 count)
- Full Field AYG #3
- 10 Burpees OYO (a crowd pleaser, mumble chatter dwindling)
- Mosey to start
- Low slow flutter x 15
- (10 count)
- Full Field AYG #4
- Merkin x 15 OMD
- Mosey to start
- LBC x 20 IC
- (10 count)
- Full Field AYG #5 (really, last one, AYG)
- YHC was gassed, so Mosey to Start
- Freddie Mercs x 20 IC

Got through with that a little faster than YHC had planned, so we moseyed to the side fence for:

### Mini Thang 3:

Balls to the Wall to Failure.  People’s chair when you finish, cheer on the remaining BTTW PAX.  Many PAX held this over a minute, way to go fellas.

### Mary

- 6 in hold x 5 count around the horn
- Biner-led 10 count boat-canoe
- J-Lo 10 count IC
- Peter Parker Merkin x 10 IC

### COT
