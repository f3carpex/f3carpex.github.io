The Mountains are calling fellas!  
7 Men for some EC work, 2 did 2 laps x 1.3 and the rest did 3 laps.  
35 Pax were there at 5:30ish, very brief disclaimer/mission statement.  
  
Warmup: Follow me: mosey across the street, watch for cars, do a standard warm up, mosey back across the street to the track.

The Thang:  
Run a lap around the track at 90%  
Do something while we wait on the six.  
Fall in behind Mopar for a cool down lap.  
Do some squats.  
Repeat this several times, rotating Squats and LBCs, also following Callahan, How How and Sooey on the cool down laps.
