The air was cool and the gloomiest of AO’s was lit by a clear morning sky with a bright waning gibbous moon. It was a joy to be able to officially re-open Wolverine. The five other HIM that showed up made it a morning to remember with mumble chatter that YHC has seriously missed over the past 6 weeks. While we were away, TOC graciously finished their construction project. So, not only did we re-open the AO, we moved the flag back to its rightful place in the main parking lot. In addition, the AO has had a few substantial upgrades: New paths and bridges, connecting us to the greenways, a tunnel, fresh new pavement, and a tall set of stairs. We spent the morning putting them to the test.
