Sleds in July! YHC dusted the cobwebs from the ol’nog’n to come up with a limited run workout that would entertain the PAX looking for a fast pace….  Here goes.

Shutin stated to Aspartame at 5:25 oh there will be others.  And as he finished that sentence in roles 4 more….  Something about Kryptonite, is it the 15 minutes earlier, or the location.  YHC was pumped to have 7 PAX show even with the limited run preblast / warning.  Who knew Franklin would still come out knowing it was a limited run… luckily YHC stepped up to the challenge to create a Hi-Tempo beatdown.
