The downtown Cary heat was a little more intense than I was expecting when I arrived, so I considered calling an audible and retreating to the parking deck to prepare for the 9/11 Stair Climb.  But my rhyming brothers were up to the challenge, so Three Cool Cats braved the heat.

**Warm Up**

Mosey up the sidewalk to the shade of one of the buildings.  It was the last shade we'd see today.  Good Afternoons, Sir Fazio Arm Twirlies (both directions), Imperial Walkers, Cotton Pickers.

**Thang 1**

Mosey across Academy Street the parking lot behind the Chamber of Commerce.  We did the Dirty Dozen, run to the top of the lot for Carolina Dry Docks, run back to the bottom for World War II sit-ups.

**Thang 2**

Bear crawl the length of one parking space, perform seven standard merkins, lung walk back, repeato while increasing the number of parking spaces and decreasing the number of merkins by one.

**Thang 3**

Mosey back across Academy Street to the rock pile for some Colt 45s.  45 curls, first 15 start at the bottom and come halfway up, next 15 start halfway up and come to the top, last 15 start at the bottom and come all the way to the top.

**Mary**

Mosey back across the tracks to the courtyard near the flag poles.  The pax took turns calling exercises, Freddie Mercurys, burpees, Homer-to-Marge (with feeling), that Carolina Wine thing that Pet Sounds tortures us with, box cutters, LBCs, and finally Have A Nice Day.

**COT**

This was Pierogi's first trip to Rush Hour, he seemed suspicious when we told him to take his shoes off and cool them off in the fountain.  Announcements included the F3 Dads event at Bond Lake this Saturday, the 9/11 Stair Climb, the CSAUP Odyssey on October 7th, and the upcoming launch of Wolverine and Slippery When Wet.  Prayers included all of the recent request posted to the GroupMe prayer group, praises for Hi-Liter creating that group, and continued prayers that Yogi gets invited to boot camp to become a park ranger.

**NMS**

I'm looking forward to larger groups at Rush Hour when the weather cools, but I always enjoy the smaller groups.  I've posted with Pierogi many times but I actually got to talk to him today.  Thanks to him and Yogi for pushing me through a tough workout.
