There are a few truisms in life:

1. You're going to die and you have no idea when
2. Make time for your friends and loved ones
3. YHC is only going to post once a year at the following AOs: FC, BH, DP, FWD, SWW

This BB is for one of those times. It being the end of summer and with school about to start, when the Q-sheet showed an opening for FC on Thursday, I knew it was now or never. Now, where the hell is Flying Circus anyway??

Upon arrival, scouted a bit, asked Sky Blue & Biner where the pull up apparatus is, met all the western-Cary regulars I never see, and introduced myself to two FNGs who are about to have the time of their lives! Soundtrack included, of course!

**Warm-up** to your standard Pierogi warmup routine of SSH, Windmills, IW, Plank and plank-related stretches, Shakiras, merkins. Got a little bit of flack for no GMs from Nature Boy (naturally) so filed that away for later. Soundtrack: [U Got the Look (Gary Numan)](https://youtu.be/28gVTcUJN9M), [Desire (Gene Loves Jezebel)](https://youtu.be/_RLTUguVO8g) & [So Alive (Love and Rockets)](https://youtu.be/-L41MhFPU9s).

**Thangs**

Mosey southward, making a couple pit stops for merkins (regular, wide, diamond) and squats. Soundtrack: [She Sells Sanctuary (The Cult)](https://youtu.be/ZCOSPtyZAPA)

Eventually made it to Not-yet-fancily-named Hill up from the greenway for 7s: derkins on the bottom, burpees on the top. Soundtrack: [Phantom (Sisters of Mercy)](https://youtu.be/wvSMY8GDdo4) & [Fascination Street (The Cure)](https://youtu.be/4ycl_ayPHU0)

Mosey over to the elementary school for a partner routine. Groups of 3 to finish 50 pulls ups / 100 merkins / 150 WWIIs. If you have ECPs to your name, add 5 for every 500 completed YTD. Biner is at 7,000+!! Soundtrack: [Everyday is Halloween (Ministry)](https://youtu.be/KFPI9b9N6CQ) & [To the Hilt (Die Krupps)](https://youtu.be/QLVpyPCEjxU)

Mosey to the bleachers for a slippery and dangerous sequence of L/R step ups, dips, derkins. Soundtrack: [Immigrant Song (Karen O & Trent Reznor)](https://youtu.be/xQtXsp4tIbw).

**Mary**

Back at the basketball court for GMs (thanks Nature Boy), LBCs, L/R heel touches, flutter kicks, supermans, HAND. Soundtrack: [Love Will Tear Us Apart (Joy Division)](https://youtu.be/zuuObGsB0No) & [Mother (Danzig)](https://youtu.be/Q7KLdET1lBM)

Today's workout brought to you by bleak-outlook feeling-like-an-outcast high school Adam.

#NoOYO folks. As ridiculous as it seems in retrospect or from the outside, music like this helped me feel like I 'belonged'. Try to keep that perspective when I see modern day outsiders as well.

_Oh, why can't I live a life for me?  
Why should I take the abuse that's served?  
Why can't they see they're just like me  
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide world_
