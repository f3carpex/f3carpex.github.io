If I'm being honest I always thought MASH the TV show wasn't very good. Maybe I'm just not an Alan Alda guy. But I really like MASH the AO.

Mid 40's with a light breeze.  A beautiful morning for a workout.  An even dozen surround what can only be described as a very interesting and/or aesthetically challenged shovel flag.  I heard this was a workout for injured people, but everyone here looks good to go.  We may have to change the plan.  No FNGs, but I have never worked out with Bonanza or Huckleberry before.  Pledge.  Mosey. 

To the lower parking lot and circle up on for:

- 5 Good mornings OMD
- 25 SSH IC
- 10 SFAC IC
- Calf Stretch + 15 Merkins IC x 2

Mosey to the Amberly commercial district where everyone finds a place on an immaculate brick knee wall:

- Dips IC / Alternating One-Leg Squats OMD (20/15/10) - Prodigal informs me that these squats originate in Bulgaria
- Derkins OMD and Right Leg Step-Ups OMU (20/15/10) - No geography factoids added here
- Irkins OMD and Left Leg Step-Ups OMU (20/15/10)

During these exercises, Pivot tells us that Dave Thomas tried to kill him with a bad chicken sandwich last weekend.  But based on current bathroom status he is now winning the battle.  Thanks to any of you guys that mentioned this at COT this week.

Prodigal starts complaining about mileage.  Apparently the 0600 start didn't afford enough time for an EC run.  In order to give the people what they want we run around in circles for a bit and then end up in the lower parking lot where we began.  Let's count some lines (descending reps per line, 8 down to 1):

- Bear Crawls and Burpees
- Walkcrab and WW2s
- Lunges and Prisoner Squats
- Crabwalk and Crabcakes

Trike strolls into the middle of this exercise with 9 minutes left in the workout.  It is such a Boss move that you can't even be mad about it.  Someone allegedly asserts that I'm a dick during the burpee portion.  But it happens in sing-song cadence, so you can't be mad about that either.  Mosey back to the flag for the customary Chilcutt, and we are done. Term Paper has some DDD swag left.  But it's gone now, so don't contact him.  No spoken prayers or praises.  YHC took us out.
