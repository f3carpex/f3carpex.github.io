Good morning. YHC was on the Q sheet, then Pickles asked for it for his anniversary, then Pickles had a tooth fall out or something, so I'm back baby.

Fresh off a fulfilling, yet taxing, 30-minute block for #F3Pray24 and I was ready to lead the pax for a solid beatdown.Seeing 1 FNG, and taking time to mention Pray 24, a quick bow of the heads before we left the lot; pax were witnessed to a prayer + mission statement + disclaimer combo. The rainbow unicorn of pre-workout monologues.

Warm-up: Out of the park and down to the Weston lots/hill, circle up for Pickle Pounders (in honor of our brother's anniversary even though he couldn't be there), GM, SSH, Sir Fazio and Seal Claps.

The Thang:

- 12 trips up and down the hill for a total of 24, 1 burpee at the top 1 burpee at the bottom
- We did these in sets of 4 and after the first 4 we did 1-2-3-4 Jack Webbs
- Hill sets 5-8 including the same on JW's and the same for 9-12.
- So, 12 trips up and down with a total of 24 burpees and a 12 count of Jack Webbs.
- Back to the park, with a stop along the way for a set of Erkins (with an E), Dips and Derkins on the rail.
- Cut through the woods to the hoops court. Sorry Commish, bad idea on my part. But, you have some nice elbow road rash at this point. \*Seriously, sorry.
- On the court of a few rounds of Mary, and back on your feet.
- Take the guys over to reflection rock for three rounds of follow the Merkin and Squat around the circle.
- 2 min of quite reflection with hands on the rock.
- Take the pax back to the lot to wrap it up with some Mary.

COT: 14, welcome FNG Tone Deaf. The Pax took us out, hands joined with the Our Father.

NMS: Once again the power of F3 and more importantly the power of prayer is on full display with a day like this. Hold each other, our families, our communities, and our prayers on your heart. I love you guys!
