Yeah, so relatively speaking I may lack a little in the creativity department when it comes to creating a workout.  Oh well.  When we're all sucking wind 20 minutes in, no one is complaining that I didn't dig deep enough into the F3 exicon.  Any chatter at that point is usually a result of all of us pushing harder, getting better.  15 PAX got the basic treatment at Dante's Peak this morning.
