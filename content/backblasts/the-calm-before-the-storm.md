I honestly couldn't think of a title for today's workout, and Disco Duck said this while we were warming up w/o kettlebells, so I thought, why not.

We circled up for a little warm up, both with and without our kettlebells.

YHC took us out with a quote from Dr. Robert Shuller

> It takes but one positive thought when given a chance to survive and thrive to overpower an entire army of negative thoughts. Most people who succeed in the face of seemingly impossible conditions are people who simply don't know how to quit. Because tough times never last, but tough people do.
