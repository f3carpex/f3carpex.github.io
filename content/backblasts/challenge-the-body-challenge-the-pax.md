We had 2 fine men wander for a 5ish mile EC run (great running with you, Flenderson!)

17 men came to Phoenix to challenge their body under YHC. Gathered everyone together and off for a Mosey to the upper baseball field parking lot. Q went to pick up the 6, Pierogi stepped up and led those who were already there in a round of SSH. Thank you for your leadership, Pierogi!

Warm up:

10 Good Mornings IC

10 count each for an overhead tricep stretch, 10 count called by Pax.

10 count calf stretch, 5 Merkins on Q's down, switch legs, 10 count calf stretch followed by 5 more Merkins, on Q's down.

Thang 1: YHC's favorite, 11s.

Catalina Wine Mixers and No Surrenders with a prisoner Squat, with lunges in between. MC was getting warmed up here, but we knew the best was coming. Picked up Old Maid here as he was doing an OYO Bruisers session.

Thang 2: Dora with Rocks. With a rock trade.

100 Lion Kings, 200 Rock-yo-bodies, 300 Split Squats/Pistol squats. Other partner runs the pickle. MC got louder, and was of the same theme "If the Q is a Rucker, question posting."

Mosey back to the line, AYG to the flag.

Mary called by the Pax (best way, makes it more fun!)

DES chatter getting hot, with LOTS of solid submissions from these HIMs.
