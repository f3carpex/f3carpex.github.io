Executive Summary

We ran.  Bartman gave a 10-count.  We ran.  Bartman gave a 10-count.  We ran.  Bartman gave a 10-count.  We ran.  Bartman gave a 10-count.  We ran.  Bartman gave a 10-count...

Warm-up

Started of with the Pledge of Allegiance.  As we were about to set off, Clementine pulled in late so the PAX did burpees while we waited for him to get set.  Once he joined, we all did another 10 burpees for good measure.  Set of with nice pace to the middle school - we have some ground to cover.

In the school lot, we circle up:

20 SSH, 10 merkins, 10 cotton pickers, 10 GM

Set off down the greenway.

Thang

YHC wanted to make it all the way to the steep hill on Barnes Spring Ct.  Alas, with 18 PAX and including one with a bum knee that was going to be a stretch.  We headed down White Oak greenway stopping 1/2 mi lunge walking til the six showed up.  Bartman gave a 10-count.

Continued the run to White Oak Park and the pax bear-crawled the brige while we waited for the six.  Bartman gave a 10-count.

Mosey to the basketball court and we partnered up.

P1 lunge walked up and down the basketball court while P2 started on 100 pull ups, 200 merkins and 300 squats.  Flip-flip.

Started back to the flag (a little late) and bear crossed the bridge.  We ran for a bit and the lead stopped and did some merkins while waiting for the six.  Bartman did a 10-count.

Ran for a bit longer this time going back the longer route.  Lounge walk across the crosswalk Abbey Road style and continue on.  A few more stops with Bartman calling a 10-count.

Made it back to the parking lot a little late.  Thankfully Saban is on summer-hours and so I was spared the stink eye.

Count-o-rama: 18 Welcome FNG Suds!

Saban has summer hours!

If you ever need a 10-count, Bartman is your man.
