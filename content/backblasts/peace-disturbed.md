Its been a long time since I wrote a back blast. I think I have skipped writing one for the last 5-6 times I've Q'd. With trying to keep track of Pax attending workouts I better write this out to keep us all safe.

So I'm going to keep this simple too. Standard warmup/stretching in Apex PD parking lot. Mosey to bottom of hill and partner up. Time for some Catch me if you can. P1 is going to start lunge walking up the hill while P2 does 20 merkins. P2 runs to catch up to P1 and flip flop until we have lunge walked 3 light poles of this street. Squat hold for the 6. Time to mosey back down the hill, up the other side and all the way to the church to find some rocks.

Back with your partner, Dora 123 time. 100 squat thrusters, 200 curls, 300 lbc's while your partner holds plank.

Now time to mosey to bottom of cemetery hill. Run to first light pole and perform 10 jump squats, run to bottom of hill for 10 merkins, run to 2nd light pole for 20 jumping lunges, run to bottom of hill for another 10 merkins, run to the end of the street and squat hold for 6. Final sprint to the flag as we are now 3 minutes past.

Prayers for Bubba and his son Dylan, Disco Duck's MIL, and Wahoo's daughter with her broken arm.
