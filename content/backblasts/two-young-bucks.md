The rainy morning gave way to another beautiful afternoon in downtown Cary, perfect conditions for two young bucks to show 'em how it's done.

**Warm-Up**

Mosey around the police station to the big fountain and circle up for side straddle hops, hillbillies, cotton pickers, Sir Fazios, dips and irkens.

**The Thang**

Mosey over to Academy Street and Five and Dime it to the fountain, five merkins at each odd light pole, ten squats at each even light pole.

Mosey over to the front of Cary Elementary for twenty-twos, star jumps on one end, World War II situps at the other.

BTTW with a twenty count down the line.

Mosey back to Academy Street, stop at every other light pole for ten LBCs.

Mosey back to the flag for twenty ALRSUs.

**Mary**

Circle up for Freddie Mercurys, dying cock-a-roaches, Homer-to-Marge, Hello Dolly and have a nice day.

**COT**

**Count-a-rama**:  2 **Name-a-rama**:  0 RESPECTs, 1 meh, 1 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for guidance for Kermit in his job search, prayers for Kermit's dad as he recovers from shoulder surgery, prayers for YHC's M, prayers for all the Carpex PAX and their families who are dealing with health issues.

**BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS**

I appreciate Kermit being there and pushing me, he's not easy to keep up with.
