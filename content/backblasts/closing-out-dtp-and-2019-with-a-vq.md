With an impending night of debauchery in store for most, an impressive 28 rolled out of bed for a VQ by YHC to close out 2019. I must say, I couldn't tell at first if I was honored to have that many show up or to pity them for what might be a disaster first Q (probably both). Either way, after going over the F3 mission and core principles with the FNG (nailed it btw), we headed out for what I was hoping to be an "END THE YEAR BEATDOWN."

Mosey through the church parking lot and through downtown Apex with butt-kickers, high knees and a lovely "stroll" pace on our way to the Chamber of Commerce.

**Warm Up:** Wanted to get the blood flowing quickly to set us up nice  
for Thang 1.

-  Good Mornings (Crimson-style) with left and  
    right holds
- Plank with Annie's
- Side-straddle Hops with Smurf Jacks
- Plank with Wax-on/Wax-offs
- Control Freak Merkins

(Not sure why, but the chatter ended a little quick  
after the warm up)

**Thang 1:** The goal of Thang 1 was to see how far PAX have come in  
2019 and a benchmark for improving for 2020.

- Partner 1 did AMRAP LBCs while Partner 2 did  
    non-stop box jumps or step ups at the entrance to the Chamber. PAX were  
    instructed to complete as many LBCs as they physically could until they  
    couldn't go further (more than a 2 second pause between reps). Once both  
    partners completed their reps, toe-taps on the curb until all PAX were  
    finished.
- Then, Partner 1 did AMRAP Merkins while Partner 2 did another round of non-stop box jumps or step ups. Same instructions as the LBCs.

\*\*PAX can now use these numbers (if they remember) to set a benchmark for improvement. Try again throughout the year to see how your body is improving.

**Thang 2:** Work with your partner to complete 200 Derkins and 200 Dips. Partner 1 begins reps while Partner 2 runs a lap around Apex Fire Department. I quickly realized while participating in this that my shoulders and arms were going to be DEAD!

We then took a mosey to Apex United Methodist for Thang 2. A short sprint on the way there and then we all grabbed rocks for our next exercise (a few “up-down” shoulder presses while we waited on the 6).

**Thang 3:** The goal of Thang 2 was for PAX to push themselves as far as they can. With tired arms and shoulders from Thang 1, I chose to hit them again.

- All PAX grabbed a rock coupon for Colt 45s in cadence.
- Jog around the AUMC property with exercises on the 4 corners (20x Hand-Release Merkins, 20x Dying Cockroaches, 15x Wide-Grip Merkins and 20x Hello Dollys)
- Rock hold at 45 degrees while waiting on the 6
- Another round of Colt 45s

We disposed of the rocks and made our way back to the shovel flag for Mary.

**Mary:**

- Freddie Mercury’s
- American Hammers
- Plank hold with each PAX completing a “16 count” - my favorite number of course
- Have a nice day!

We welcomed our FNG Lucky Charms to F3 Carpex and discussed New Year’s Day Convergence. With no (outward) prayer requests, I reminded everyone that today was about seeing how far you’ve come in 2019 and recognized where you want to go in 2020. Step up and be great.
