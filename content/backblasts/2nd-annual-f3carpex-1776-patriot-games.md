The 2nd Annual 1776-themed Carpex Nation convergence on the 242nd anniversary of America’s declaration of independence from the tyranny of Mad King George III.

The south side guys are looking forward to hosting the first convergence south/east of US1/64.  I can recommend the LaQuinta Inn and Suites for those traveling from the Burlington area.

Further thanks to Joe Smith and Oofta for allowing us to use the infamous Slippery When Wet AO location.

If folks want to bring coolers of water, gatorade, etc., I don’t think it would go to waste.

Sky Blue, you’re always welcome to join us. But I can’t promise you won’t bear the brunt of 'Merica jokes!
