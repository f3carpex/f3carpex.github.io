I wanted today to be a special time and it was. I looked forward to my V Q with anticipation and I got to share it with some of the finest HIM's around and for that I am grateful. I didn't have to yell at anyone to shut up, which Frisco told me I would have to do. I was fortunate to have attended many great Q's in the past to draw from including a training Q put on by Sooey last week at DP. I really enjoyed being a part of this group and getting the opportunity to lead!

I think we can all think back to our first... The anticipation, the nerves, the look of disappointment. I was motivated in earnest to quell the disappointment and I hope this experience lived up to expectation. But if it didn't, I want you to know, it was good for me.
