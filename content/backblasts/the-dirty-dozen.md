In the gloom, 35 intrepid PAX (3 FNGs) gathered to discover what would happen in this week's first VQ.  YHC was celebrating completing 12 months of F3 goodness.   The group took off doing the Smokey Shuffle up the hill to warm-ups.

Warm-ups (12 count each) -- SSH, Good Morning, Calf Stretch, Merkins, Mt. Climbers

Thing 1 -- The Dirty Dozen -- LBCs at the bottom of the hill and Carolina Dry Docks at the top totaling 12 reps for each lap.

Intermission -- The Tunnel of Love -- In two lines of 17 and 18 men respectively, we low crawled in the cool, wet grass.  Who knew the end of July in NC would start a day in the low 60's?

Thing 2 -- 4 Corners -- After a short run to the front parking lot, the cadre of men were broken into 4 groups to run the pickle and do 12 reps of Outlaws, Imperial Stout Walkers, Merkins, and Squat Jumps at designated locations around the pickle.

Mary -- The VQ gasping his last breaths lead the intrepid sweaty people in a rousing round of Freddy Mercury's, American Hammers, LBCs, (12 reps each), and ended with Have a Nice Day.
