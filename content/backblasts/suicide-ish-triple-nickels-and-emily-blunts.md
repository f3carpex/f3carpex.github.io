Some like the saying, 'another day, another dollar' or the ever popular in my world, 'good enough for government work'. In prep for the Back in Black Q this morning and with a still to be determined BRR route on everyone's mind, I knew we needed hill work. I knew deep down though no one really wanted hill work, but maybe that's just YHC. I throw on some RATM 'Bulls on Parade' for the ride over to Koka Booth VIP lot. I have tickets for the RATM reunion tour that's currently on hold. Their music has always been a source of getting hyped for YHC so as I parked the truck and jumped out I was ready to punch someone in the face. Metaphorically of course, because first guys I see are Bluewater, Hermes, and Laloosh. That'd end badly for YHC. Back in Black is a homecoming as I helped plant the flag at this AO many Thursday moons ago and it was my first site Q responsibility. It's a great site with plenty to offer and as the cars trickled in, a solid group of HIMs emerged.

Warm Up: Pledge of Allegiance and mosey across the street to the office buildings and down to the furthest parking lot. Circle up for SSHs, Good Mornings, Sprinklers, Merkins, and Calf Stretches. Mosey to the corner of the pond at the bottom of Regency Hill. Passed to walkers on the way, one announced, 'good luck on that hill'. Thank you, ma'am but we own that hill. Ten merkins OYO and up the hill we go. It's always longer than I remember. TWSS.

Thang 1: Triple Nickels. At the top of the Regency Hill, we cross the street to neighborhood with the most pretentious street name in all of Cary .... 'Avenue of the Estates'. Drop for five merkins and run to the bottom of the hill stopping at the fire hydrant for 5 merkins. Up and keep running turning right on where the street name absurdity continues with get this 'Richilieu Dr.' What in the actual .... Run to the top of that hill and 5 more merkins. Repeato the process back to the start stopping for 5 merkins at the fire hydrant and back at the entrance gate. This sucked. Repeato back again on this time, stop at the right turn, then back to hydrant, back to stop ..... Repeato these suicide-ish triple nickels. HGTV give me a ten count before YHC calls dinosaurs before God and half of Regency. Mosey back to the bottom of Regency Hill and stop for ten merkins.

Thang 2: Mosey along the lake at a decent pace and down the path to the lake trail. Ten merkins and a time and distance check. Back to the parking lot for '5 Laps at Bristol' which is nothing more than running the pickle in the parking lot until my watch hit 3.1 miles. A decent 5K with hill work and merkins. I'll take it.

Mary: Circle up for LBCs, WWIIs, Homer to Marges, Box Cutters, and Emily Blunts. Ah, Ms. Blunt. The pax thanks you for your leadership and an official to the Exicon committee will go out later today.

You'll watch this for at least 30 seconds. Don't @ me.

COT: 13 for the total count with a few respects and the rest mehs. Announcements included TPC Sawgrass lawn care Sunday afternoon with 2ndF to follow at Woody's, sign ups on Slack. Prayers for Florida Man, those dealing with and battling wildfires out west, and the unexpected passing of Staubach's colleague. YHC took us out.

NMS: As we came up the hill the last time on the Suicide Triple Nickels, YHC was the six. The Q usually isn't the six but I take pride in this because I'm chasing stronger men. Many of whom ran 10+ hilly miles a mere 24 hours earlier at sub 9 and sub 8 paces. Incredible.

Coffeeteria followed at NYBDIII with a 92% attendance rate. It is likely the best coffeeterria in all of Carpex IMO. They are damn proud of their coffee at 3 bucks a cup to be sure, but their bagels are outstanding and pizza dough to go is the best around. Just ask Captain Jack.

Appreciate these men and the fellowship this morning. MIAGD
