**Pre-Blast**

- 16 HIM pushed themselves to their personal limits at HB as part of the 11th of 19 Murphs in 2019.
- So proud of these guys...everyone was gassed on the last mile. It takes a lot of courage and discipline to push yourself that way. Just awesome.
- #StrongerBacksStrongerHearts

**Warmup**

- Because CheddarBo slept in and the gate was locked, we launched from the lower lot.
- After reciting the Pledge at the Flag, each man grabbed a kettle bell and slow jogged to the pull-up bars.
- We then finished the first mile with a run around the pond and up through the upper lot.

**The Thang**

- 100 pull-ups, 200 'Mericans, 300 KB squats.
- Complete as much of the last mile as you can.

**COT**
