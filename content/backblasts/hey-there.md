Started the morning with an EC run. I can't remember who I ran with but while we were running a young man on his bike rode by, stopped and then came back to us and asked if we were with F3. Of course we said yes, told him where to go, and headed to the flag.

His hospital name is Niko (with an N) and since he had posted in Davidson, his F3 name is "Hey There." He was wearing a tank top, so we liked him right away.

0545 and we set off with the Rubberband Man following us. \[Side Note: Did you know there's a song called Rubberband Man and it's performed by The Spinners?\]
