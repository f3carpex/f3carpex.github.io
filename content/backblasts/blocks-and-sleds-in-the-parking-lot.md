NMS: The sled push was farther than expected, Google maps makes the area look smaller. It was a good burn. Learned I need to update my picture on Linkedin so Captain Jack has a better picture to put on Brock Lesner's body. I borrowed the blocks and sleds from our construction class at school, they were still in my truck when I got to school. The teacher saw that and came in my room and was full of new ideas on how to use them and additional "fun" items he has lying around for us to use. There will be another Q in the future. I have been invigorated by my participation in F3. The fitness part is getting better; now I look at challenging myself in the 2ndf and 3rdf areas this upcoming year. Thanks Lite Brite for the ride back to my truck and for helping me load the sleds.
