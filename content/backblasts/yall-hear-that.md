At 0515, YHC started the fellowship mosey of a half-mileish to that newest of AOs, Lion's Den, with Hello Kitty and Smithers in tow. Who doesn't want a brand-spanking new AO virtually in their back yard?

Upon arrival Sour Mash is there with the newly purchased but not yet completed shovel flag. Soon a Baker's Dozen PAX have assembled and the clock strikes 0530. One FNG, the disclaimer is pronounced, Allegiance is pledged, and Sour Mash takes the reigns.

### Warm Up

A little mosey around the lot with some backwards running, karaoke, and circle up for SSHs, Good Mornings, Windmills, Mountain Climbers and Merkins.

### Act 1 - Sour Mash

Form 2 lines, Indian Run to the church entrance. Partner up, with partner 1 doing BTTW while partner 2 ran the pickle. Flip flop and repeato 3 times.

Same partners, now we do a Catch Me if you Can. First round, squat jumps. Second round, star jumps.

### Act 2 - Red Ryder

After a Disco Duck 10 count, we mosey into Scott's Mill for 7s on the hill. After calming the PAX who are concerned about unsuspecting patrons who might still be sleeping, we commence with our 7s - Burpees at the top, and Monkey Humpers at the bottom.

Gather the PAX after completion, and mosey back to the church. Find a wall for dips, Irkins and 2 wall jump burpees. Mosey BACK to the church entrance, circle up on our 6 for a round with Captain Thor - 1:4 Big Boy Situps/American Hammers up to 10:40.

Fellowship mosey to the flag.

### COT

3 Respects, 8 Mehs. Welcome FNG Rushmore (ND native).

Announcements: The Mule 3/9, SNS convergence 3/13 - moving Lion's Den official launch to 3/6.

Prayers/praises: Crimson & family with his FIL's illness, Hi-Liter's daughter, Disco's M Kelly had a rough day yesterday. YHC took us out.

### NMS

This was the soft launch of Lion's Den, the newest Carpex AO. A standard boot camp with an 05:30 start. And it IS nice to have something in the back yard, but that wasn't the real reason for this. Sour Mash had already been planning on bringing an AO to StMM - tclaps to HIM for looking to reach that congregation's men!

This is a very versatile site - large parking lots and athletic fields abound. We got a preview of it at the 2018 Odyssey, so it was only time until a permanent AO found its place here.

As Carpex continues to grow, always make room for that FNG; the Sad Clown who doesn't know what he needs yet. We've all been there - so make it a point! MIAGD every day
