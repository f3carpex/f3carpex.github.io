Date:  June 13, 2018

Weather:    Humid, 83 degrees, cloudy

40 Pax total, including 17 for Vespers.   What a group!

5:45.   No Pet Sounds (he did make Refinery). Burt takes the Q.

**Warm up:**   Mosey to the gate,  head to other side of the gate for a standard warm up including 20 burpees, SSH, Merkins, Cotton Pickers, Good Mornings and Little Baby Jumping Jacks.     Sprints up the hill (about 40 yards) with a prisoner run back down the hill.  4 x.

**Thang:**  Head to the parking lot for a series of 4 corners with a variety of exercises at a 10 count each corner.      I don't remember all of the moves, but we did merkins, LBC's, Plank Jacks, CDD's and after each set of 4 corners we had a conversation about something while we planked.....learned about our names, discussed a favorite golf courses (thanks CD) and just had a good ole' time.

**Thang:** One the way back, we did a manmaker ladder up to 6 as we moved back up the hill to the gate.   1 manmaker with 1 merkin, 1 plank jack and then 1 jump, then at the next light pole 2 manmakers with 2 merkins, 2 plank jacks and then 2 jumps...up to six total.

Billy run to the parking lot.

Mary.
