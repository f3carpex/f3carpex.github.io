QIC: Gibraltar

Date: 09/20/2019

  
After 7 years of not exercising in a disciplined way and with only one month of training with F3, Pivot told me if I would like to be a Q. At the beginning it sounds to me very challenging, to lead the workout with people who are really in good shape but I did not want to miss the opportunity and thanks to Torpedo I was able to schedule my Q for the last day of the VQ week.  
We had a PAX of 15 in attendance for Gran Torino and there were no FNGs. We started with the pledge and then ran around the Green Hope Elementary for a warm-up.  

Warm Up, (we share the basketball court with the Iron Pax):  
• Good Mornings 10 Reps  
• Windmills 10 Reps  
• Imperial Walkers 10 Reps  
• Side Straddle Hops 15 Reps

  
Next, we ran to the front of the elementary school to start the first Thang.  
Thang 1: DORA Figure Eight:  
Paired off for a DORA with 100 merkins, 200 LBCs and 300 squats. Alternate between the exercises and a figure 8 lap around the two roundabouts in front of the elementary school.

  
For the second thang, we ran to the roundabout in front of the Cary Tennis Park.  
Thang 2: In this routine we did 5 reps of the following:  
• We ran to the opposite side of the parking lot  
• We did 10 burpees and ran back to the roundabout  
• We continue with walking lunges at the roundabout  
• And finally, we ran in three groups making an Indian Run back to the flag.

Mary, we circle up in front of the flag and we did:  
• American Hammer 10 Reps  
• World War II 10 Reps  
• Boxcutters 10 reps  
• Freddy Mercury 10 Reps  
• Have a nice day

We wrapped up with the Circle of Trust, we did count-a- ramma, name-a-ramma and the prayer was called by Hi Liter.  
I would like to thank the PAX because you all support me a lot during my VQ, I really feel very confident and I would like to thank Torpedo and Krusty in a special way, who helped me to prepare the Q. In a nutshell, it was a great experience.
