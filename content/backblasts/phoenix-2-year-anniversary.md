Phoenix was my first Q site, I hope years later I did a slight better job. Nice cool morning and off we went at 6:30

 

Slow jog towards rock pile, few warm ups then we wrapped a rock and did some rock work, balls to the wall and peoples chair. Then we did some light pole work, and did a hill climb. Next was the Fry Daddy repeato of parking lot laps.

 

Great being with you men and your friendships mean the world to me.
