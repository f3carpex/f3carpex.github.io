It was a scorching 57 degrees this morning, perfectly timed for Tank Top Thursday.  YHC was the only participant, but appreciated Parker's good intentions this morning, only to realize that he doesn't own one.  I think he can fix that with some scissors by next week...

11 PAX ready to go, no FNGs, and we're off.

Warm up jog around the track to the far parking lot, wave hello to FiA as we pass.
