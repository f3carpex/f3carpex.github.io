**NMS:** Kitty mentioned that someone from another region mentioned that we do all 3F's well. So that while we had a lower number than normal at BO, we had new AO's launching and we have more new men joining us every morning. During the discussion of this, it reminded me of one of the quotes I have always used in my life that is attributed to Saint Francis of Assisi. "Go into the world and preach the Gospel, use words when necessary." I believe this fits Carpex almost perfectly, We go in the area and preach F3, and use words when necessary. The way we welcome people who are new and old and how we try our best to include everyone, speaks loudly without any words.  Just under 6 months ago I started F3, I have now Q'd 3 times and will do it more. As someone else said on slack, my best days always start with an F3 Workout.
