In the ever brightening gloom as we giddy up toward summer, 15 brave and intrepid men made their way to an outpost in the northernmost western AO in Cary, for an early morning beatdown by Carpex legend Petsounds.

Petsounds has other ideas and was thousands of miles away in sunny CA whilst all this was going on, so instead YHC stepped in as a makeweight Q whilst Petsounds googleplexed in Palo Alto.....
