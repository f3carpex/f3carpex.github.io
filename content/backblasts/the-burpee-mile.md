0530 and see something you don't see very often in the POGL (if ever?). Burt and Coney downtown checking out the lights, and the finest Tuesday morning AO in the POGL. After the pledge we moseyed to the Hell's Bells/Tortoises parking lot for a quick warmup.

#### Warmup

- Good Mornings
- Imperial Walkers
- Sir Fazio Fwd
- Seal Clap
- Sir Fazio Reverse
- Runners stretch
- 5 Control Freak Merkins
- Upward Dog stretch

#### Thang 1: Diego with Partner

- 50 Inverted Rows/Aussie Pullups
- 100 Merkins
- 150 Squats

#### Thang 2: The Burpee Mile

Ran back across 55 to the the bottom of W Moore St. From there we started a burpee mile up to to Rogers Circle at the top of the hill (second stop sign or Sour Mash stated "Oh, the one we cannot see?") which is 1/10 of a mile. Each PAX does one burpee, then broad jump, then one burpee, then broad jump, then burpee, then broad jump... You get the idea. Only one PAX had lower back issues, and he just did a hill run for the entire time. The rest of the PAX groaned, but they all pushed through to the top. At YHC request the ones in front when complete picked up the six, and even did more burpees. Assuming 4 feet per burpee/broad jump we did at least 132 burpees to reach the top.

#### Thang 3: Railing Hold

Ran down to the town office park, and I couldn't find the name in the exicon but while partner did LBCs the other put his hands and feet on the wheelchair ramp rails and walked himself down. We did several sets of these until we had 4 minutes to go then a 1/4 mile run back to the flag up the W. Moore St. hill.

Will have to bring that burpee mile back again, it was rough, but as Coney said it left him with a "skip in his step" knowing he'd pushed through and knocked it out.
