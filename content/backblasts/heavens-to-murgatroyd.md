**Pre-Blast**

- In Welch, Murgatroyd means: a clearing in the forest on the way to the moore. So, there's that.
- An even dozen HIM showed one another what it means to be in F3: no man left behind, no man where we find him.
- So proud of the guys who stayed with their brothers throughout this tough workout. The men refused to leave anyone alone. Just awesome.

**The Warmup**

- Pledge of Allegiance at the flag.
- Mixed Run around the two lots
- Circle up for: Groiner Merkins, Calf Stretch, CDD, SSH
- Run to the rock pile

**The Thangs**

- Choose a rock that will rock your body
- Esau's Ladder: Beginning at the crosswalk by the rock pile, run to the first light pole, perform 1 Burbee and return to the start for 3 Rock Your Bodies. Run 2 light poles, perform 2 Burbees, return to the start for 3 Rock Your Bodies. Continue increasing light poles and Burbees while returning each time to the start for 3 Rock Your Bodies. Keep going all the way to Green Level Road.
- FINISH TOGETHER at the top.
- Snake Indian Run back to the flag.
- FINISH TOGETHER at the flag.
