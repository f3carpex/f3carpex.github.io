I'm gonna be honest with you. Many Saturdays I take the opportunity to get a little extra sleep. This was a good workout week, which also means that the body is feeling a little sore by the time today rolled around. But, the opportunity to Q Phoenix was too much to pass up. So I managed to unfold myself from the fartsack and make it to Bond Park in plenty of time to get some stretching in. It's gonna be a good day.

Following the successful EH of 16 Steves at Lowes Foods on Thursday, I was excited to hear that Intimidator had another FNG coming today. Like I said, it's gonna be a good day. 21 PAX were gathered round the flag at 0630 for first exercise, Pledge of Allegiance.

### Warm Up

SSHs, then slow mosey to the back parking lot near Field 7. Along the way get in some Karaoke to loosen the hips. Standard fare of Sir Fazio, Good Mornings, Steve Earles, Moroccan Night Clubs, and Plank Jacks. Finally, to make sure we're really warmed up, Jack Webb up to 10:40.

### Thang 1

Nice easy mosey to the lake dam and rock pile. Pick a non-traveling rock. 7s, with rock-yer-body at the bottom, and world's best merkins at the top of the dam. Mosey around to the stairs to come back down. First PAX finished do sets of curls, overhead presses and squats while waiting for the Six. YHC notices some really bad squat form, so once the six have arrived, we do 10 PROPER form squats on my down. Proper form means eyes up the entire time.

### Transition

Form 2 lines, Prisoner Indian Run to top of the hill at the big field. This is to work on posture. Then mosey the rest of the way to the park.

### Thang 1.1

Sets of 10 Merkins/5 Pullups, as many sets until the Q says mosey back to the parking lot.

### Mary

Captain Thor up to 8:32, time is out, Have a Nice Day

### COT

- Welcome FNG Bogey!
- Countorama, Nameorama, Announcements, Prayer requests, YHC took us out

### NMS

Proper form helps to keep you healthy. Pay attention to that. Make it a great day, and be a little better today than you were yesterday.
