On my drive to Tortoises in the blistering 27⁰ temperature, I took a small detour to scope out the AO.  The original area I wanted to do my planned thang would not work due to safety concerns, black ice.  Safety is ALWAYS #1 in my mind when leading a group of HIM.  I reverted to Plan B.  As I got into my parking spot, Theismann and Spartan were getting after ECP.  My boy, Disco Duck, greeted me as I arrived.  I’m extremely humbled and honored that this was my 3rd1stF workout with him this week since I started my quest for a 6-pack Q week.  TRUE TRUE TRUE HIM, he is.  I mentioned Plan B earlier, read on for the details.

0530 start – light mosey around the parking lot and circle up for some warm-up: GM, Hamstring stretch, calf stretch.  Since we were in the position, I called Merkins and plank jacks.  Knowing what was planned, I wanted to ensure each PAX was warmed up fully.  Next was Sir Fazio’s (forward and reverse) and air presses.  To close out the warm-up, we aspired to be like Michael Phelps.

At 0531, I noticed some headlights pulling into the parking lot.  It was a maroon Toyo Tacoma.  I thought it was Pickles.  Apologies Pickle for even thinking it was you.  It was my man, left to be nameless, but he knows who he is …  his name starts with an “I” and ends in an “R”.  Love you Brother!  Either way, burpees was already on the agenda.  Thank you for the reward burpees!!!

I mentioned Plan B; well here it is.  The plan was not to cut anything out, I just had to split the thang.  We moseyed over to our more inclined hill for Thang 1 11’s escapade. (Carolina Dry Dock and squats).  This is where I asked the PAX to partner up so they can learn more about each other.

Thang 1:

11’s escapade (Carolina Dry Dock and squats) with a partner.  Togetherness was the goal.

Once completed, QIC calls 10 burpees (OMD).  Mosey over to hill #2 for Thang 2 another set of 11s.

Thang 2:

11’ (Catalina Wine Maker and jump squats).

Once completed, QIC calls 10 burpees (OMD).  Mosey over to our wall for People’s Chair with merkins down the line for two rounds.

Mosey over to the parking lot to start our Mary thinking that we had until 0630.  It dawned on me, at that time, that we are out of time as my watch showed 0616.  Circle up and on our 6, I called have a nice day.

Mary:

Have a nice day

Count-a-rama: 23

Name-a-rama: 5 respects, 13 mehs, 5 hates

Announcements: Christmas Party at Fortnight on 12/13, S. Wake CSAUP on 12/15, 130 toys for Operation Sweet Tooth.

Prayers / Praises: Ausfahrt’s health and recovery, Crimson’s recovery, Terminator’s recovery from knee replacement surgery which he caught Mersa after the operation, safety for Earhart and family and for all those who will be traveling during the holidays, Kelly’s continued good week.

BOM: YHC took us out.

NMS:

My goal for such a large number of PAX was to partner up so the PAX can mumblechatter amongst themselves as they conquer the thang and to get to know each other.  There was a lot of mumblechatter going on but it also created accountability and the will and drive to push each other without hurting each other.

I………r (love you Brother) tried to sneak in on the down low inconspicuously but he was already spotted by YHC.  It’s hard to get by me … just kidding.  Reward burpees were given and well accepted.

Theismann took the lead with a pre-blast Tuesday evening on EC pull-up which he and Spartan got on it.

Freebird ran in like a Phoenix.

I almost lost track of time looking at my watch and seeing 0616 thinking I had 15 more mins left to do a round of Mary PAX choice.  It dawned on me that we started at 0530.  End time is 0615.  Called HAND immediately.

Thank you for letting me lead you in the blistering gloom.  I hope you all stayed warm throughout the beatdown.
