**Warm-up** Pledge Run to upper lot in varying styles. Lots of mumbling on the way up about the lack of effort the workout was requiring. This made YHC smile looking forward to the continuing mumblechatter that would be shared. Once the circle was setup we: SSH x 20 Good Morning x 10 Imperial Walkers x10 Cotton Pickers x 10

Enough warm up, let's get the party started with a run to back down to lower lot. Some grumbling about running backwards at one point but no one fell over like suggested so we continued on.

Leaving home is not always fun but getting to visit other regions is a blast and you inevitably learn some new workout tools and meet some amazing PAX. This one came courtesy of Sniper from the Suncoast gang in Florida. With all the exercises involved YHC employed a whiteboard which worked great, the flashlight to see said whiteboard was another issue but since FOD is a premier location for Carpex it was well-lit and we pressed on and did the following with a run around the pickle between each set of exercises:

- 100 Squats/10 Burpees
- 90 LBC/9 Burpees
- 80 Peter Parkers/8 Burpees
- 70 American Hammers/7 Burpees
- 60 Dips/6 Burpees
- 50 Overhead Claps/5 Burpees
- 40 SSH/4 Burpees
- 30 Merkins/3 Burpees
- 20 Alternating Leg Lifts/2 Burpees
- 10 World Worst Merkins/1 Burpees

Now inevitably, some PAX are quicker than others and didn’t want them to be stuck doing plank or squats so a reward for finishing early earned them the opportunity to do step-ups and pull-ups till the rest of the PAX finished. The earlier mumblers were a little quieter now. Some said it was because of all the counting, others said it was due to the puddle of either tears or sweat they were dealing with, YHC is very happy now.

**Thang 2**

A quick mosey over to the rock pile afforded us a chance to move some of those rocks around. Simply changing the pile form was not enough for these ROCKstar PAX so we mixed in a few moves: 25 Squats with the rock over your head 25 Curls for Girls 25 Tricep Extensions 10 Rock Your Body

Mixing in some more gifts from other regions, we did an exercise I was told was called 30/60/90 but quickly an angry PAX (I think it was Shut-In and Franklin but I don’t want to call out anyone specifically) told me it is called the Protractor. Instead of doing lots of different exercises we went around the circle and each of the PAX called out an angle on the protractor and we all moved accordingly. I still feel bad for skipping Trike so I will be sure to give him opportunity at my next Q, plus he has an awesome workout sweater.

**Announcements**

- Don’t forget about Burt’s drawing for Haven House Beach House Raffle Drawing at Bond Brothers Wednesday Night, October 24th. 2nd F 5-6:30 and the drawing at 6:30
- Pet Sounds let us know about a new opportunity to grow further as a HIM. On Monday mornings we will gather at Panera in Beaver Creek and do some 2nd F from 6:30-45 and then dive into the Q-Source material ([https://f3nation.com/category/q/](https://f3nation.com/category/q/)) starting at 6:45. As we all know, F3 is much more than a workout group. One of the objectives is to help each PAX find the dolphin (the task a person was born to do best) and daffodil (the people-group each person was born to serve) in his life and then put them to use. The material in the Q-Source is focused on making that exact thing happen and so much more. Reach out to Pet Sounds for more details.

**TAP (Thoughts and Prayers)**

- Roxanne mentioned a personal friend lost their father recently and asked for prayers for the family
- Clementine’s ankle
- Rooney’s knee

YHC shared about seeing the PAX and other people run the Tuna Run 200 this past weekend. Each and every person was either pushing themselves to go further and test themselves or was helping and encouraging someone else to reach for their best. It was epic and inspiring and it is how we each should live every day in all areas of our life.

YHC took us out.
