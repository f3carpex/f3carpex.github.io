EC run with Wonderbread & YHC

Because I know it is loved by so many, I dusted off the home gym equipment and trucked it on over to Claymore for another round of that circle workout that still needs a really cool name.

It couldn't have worked out any better today. I had 10 stations, 10 guys and a cool new Tabata clock app on my "brand new" iPhone 7.

**Warm Up  
**Short Mosey, circle up for some Good Mornings, Windmills, SSH, Steve Earle

**The Thang  
**Each guy started at a station for 1 minute on and 30 seconds rest. We did two complete rounds of the following:

Agility Ladder – Quick Feet back and forth  
Ab Roller  
30lb sandbag w/o handles – Squat, press, and slam  
Heavy Bag - Flipping it over  
Box Jump  
Kettle Bell  
Battle Rope  
Dumbells (curls)  
Weighted bar overhead Squat  
Cinderblock (man makers)

A few times we threw in some called exercises such as:  
LBCs  
Merkins  
Imperial Walker  
Freddy Mercury  
Scorpions

No prayers of praises

YHC took us out with a quote from Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.

> "Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard word leads to success. Greatness will follow."
