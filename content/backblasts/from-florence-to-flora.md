If you're like most of us much of your time, mental, emotional, physical and spiritual energy has been spent either preparing for, getting through or rebound from Hurricane Florence. And rightfully so. One of the great things about F3 is that it allows us to escape from the daily stresses and toil in a whole other way. This is how we went from Florence to Flora.
