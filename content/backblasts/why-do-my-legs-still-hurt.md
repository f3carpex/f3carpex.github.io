It's been 50 hours and 13 minutes since this workout at SNS on Wednesday September 26, and my legs still hurt. This was the first installment of Flaccoversary week and I wanted to make it one to remember. Now I'm trying to forget it. Read below to see why.

**Warm Up**

Mosey to the gate, circle up and warm up Good morning x 10 Sir Fazio Arm Circles x 10 front x 10 back Imperial Walkers x 15 Shoulder/tricep lean R/L Merkins x 40

Partner up, catch me if you can to the community center rock pile

- Partner 1 – 5 burpees, then run to catch partner
- Partner 2 – lunge walk
- It was A LOT of lunge walking, mumblechatter ensued. It was beautiful. YHC wanted to succumb to all the lunge complaints and the burning in my legs, but we trudged onward

**The Thang**

Grab a rock from the aforementioned rock pile. “Ego rock or travel rock?” they asked. “Yes”. Just pick a damn rock. You will carry said rock for the rest of the workout, and only be allowed to put down for one of the exercises, which you will hate.

**Four Corner Modified Dora Rock-A-Palooza**

Partner 1 starts curling; Partner 2 lunge walks with rock overhead (yes, more lunges) the long side of the rectangle. When partner 2 reaches next corner, call partner 1 to join you and start curling. Partner 1 lunge walk to meet up with partner 2.

Repeat but do Rock-Push-BearCrawls on short sides, and switch to Rock Rows after curls.

After two complete circuits, the PAX seemed to start questioning their choice of rocks. Let’s mix it up – everyone put down your rock; All-You-Got sprint to stop sign and back, PAX choice of rock when you return. Sorry, old, slow guys.

(YHC thought he oughta be a benevolent Q and allow all the other PAX to choose new rocks first. Bad idea.)

How about 2 more times around the 4 corners? Those lunges are feeling really good.

Return the rock and find a curb for one last move – Angry Elf’s almost-famous ‘Death Squats’ x 15

Mosey back to the flag
