From the time YHC's bowels awoke him at 4:56, it just felt like a merkin kind of day. You know how that is, amrite? Ma Bell's Qing, you know there will be merkins. Goose and I arrived to a reluctant group of PAX. I mean, it's 70 degrees out already. Let's get out of those cars! By the time 5:45 struck, we were 15 strong. Let's go.

Into the park to the first ntersection for **Warm-Up**

- 15 **merkins** IC
- 20 SSH IC
- 10 **merkins** IC
- 10 forward/reverse Arm Circles IC
- 10 GMs IC
- 5 **merkins** IC

**The Thang** = the Traveling Beast

**1st leg**: Run to back of park, stopping 6 times for 6 (what else) **merkins**. Plank it out when you're done. Once all PAX is reassembled, Mary speed round, which is:

- 10 Hello Dollys IC
- 10 Flutter Kicks IC
- 10 LBCs IC
- 10 Reverse LBCs IC
- 10 American Hammers

**2nd leg**: Run over to the shelter. Lunge walk back and forth between the shelters 6x , completing 6 sets of alternating L/R step-ups each time. Squat it out when done. Once all PAX reassembled, **Merkin** speed round,which is:

- 10 standard **merkins**
- 10 diamond **merkins**
- 10 wide grip **merkins**
- 10 offset **merkins** (right hand forward)
- 10 offset **merkins** (left hand forward)

**3rd leg**: Run back to middle of back parking lot. Run to the lower circle drive, stopping 6x for 6 star jumps and back to middle of parking lot. Plank it out when done. Another round of speed Mary

**4th leg**: Run over to sand volleyball courts. Line up at side of near court. Run width of each of 3 courts and back stopping to do 6 knee tuck jumps in between each court. Jog over to nearby basketball court for anotherÂ  round of speed merkins.

**5th leg**: Time to head back to front of park. 6 stops along the way, performing 6 LBCs at each stop. Once PAX is assembled, another round of speed Mary.

**6th leg**: Don't think I forgot the burpee. Around the front parking lot, stopping 6x for 6 burpees at each stop. Crowd favorite. And look, we finished right on time. No time for our 3rd round of speed merkins.

COT

**Count-a-rama**: 15 strong! **Name-a-rama**: 5 RESPECTS, 9 mehs, 1 hate **Announcements**: CarPEX/Churham convergence this Saturday 0700 at Bond Park. Pre-ruck at 0600. CarPEX Picnic at Bond later in the day at 1430 **Prayers**: prayers for Aristocrat and his friend Zach's family **BOM**: YHC took us out in prayer. Today's message: be present. Be present with your family, your friends, your co-workers. Plan for the future, but give your attention now to those closest to you. You never know when an interaction with someone will be the last.

- It was a pleasure leading you men. After almost 3 years of F3, I look back and marvel at how many fine men I've met who make me better. It is humbling to know how much I have to work on, but also exciting that there is so much opportunity! Thank you.
- By the way, if you count the IC merkins during warm-up as 2, we did 196 merkins.
- Time cheated us out of 50 other merkins we had planned. Do them at your desk today.
- Merkins make you strong like bull!
