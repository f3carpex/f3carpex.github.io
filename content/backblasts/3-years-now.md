So 3 years ago I showed up to Rush Hour, it was stupid hot, I had no gloves, but a man who I would later learn was named "Old Maid" walked to the parking lot welcomed me, and led me over to the gathering point to introduced me to the rest of the men gathered. We waiting for the "Q" named "Riptide" who arrived right on time grabbed a small kid's tricycle and said follow me. The rest is history.
