Yesterday evening I was perusing the weather forecast, workout options and Q-sheets....ok, yes, I was Q-Shopping a bit. About that time, Yoga Mat posted that Bluewater would be running the show here at FWD in the morning and I immediately decided...THAT is where I'm going!!! Shortly thereafter, I got a call from Bluewater advising he would not be able to make it and asking if I would fill in for him. Of course I would! So he gave me the run-down of what he had planned, and I must admit....it sounded pretty awesome.

13 lucky HIMs posted at FWD this morning to totally and completely wreck their pecks and shoulders, though they didn't know it at the time. 0530....here we go. I quickly briefed the pax (no FNG's) and we did the pledge then mosey'd to the pickle for a warmup, Bluewater style!

- 20 SSH
- 20 Regular Merkins
- 20 Imperial Walkers
- 20 Wide Grip Merkins
- 10 Good mornings
- 20 Diamond Merkins
- 20 Squats
- 20 Regular Merkins
- 20 SFAC
- 20 Regular Merkins (That's 100 total so far!)

At this point, Banjo noticed a theme and somewhat figured out the rest of the workout.... Let's mosey to the bottom of the hill!

- 1 Worst Merkin Ever (WME) at the first light pole
- 2 WME's at the second
- 3 at the third
- etc
- 10 at the tenth (We're now at 265 Merkins, counting each WME as 3)

I've got to admit....all was well until about the 7th lightpole or so, then fatigue and lactic threshold started becoming a real thing. Once the six was in we did 20 jump squats and mosey'd back down the hill for 10 more Merkins while we waited for the 6, and then over to the grocery store parking lot.

- Line up for some Sprints! Sprint two lightpoles, mosey back
- 10 Regular Merkins
- Sprint again
- 10 Regular Merkins
- Sprint again
- 5 WME's (We're now at 310)
- Sprint again, then mosey back to the park and the rock pile....grab a healthy rock
- 10 Overhead Presses in-cadence
- 10 Merkins
- 10 Tricep Extensions
- 10 Mekins
- 10 Overhead Presses

- Put the rocks back and mosey to the flag for Mary

- 20 Dying Cockroach's
- 10 Merkins
- 10 American Hammers in-cadence
- 20 Merkins (Grand total......410 Merkins!)
- Have a nice day....with some pec stretching!

This workout was a bit tougher than I thought it would be, and I did modify slightly from Bluewater's original plan, though this is pretty much it. Greenbow rejoined us this morning after about an 18-month hiatus, and he toughed it out. Peeping Tom from South Wake joined us as well, and we've got to get that guy a better name!!

Announcements:

- Mule (Raleigh CSAUP) Next Saturday 3/9 launching 6:30 from the Raleigh Art Museum

Prayers:
