As I reflect on the year that has been and prepare to celebrate the completion of my 58th trip around the sun, I busted out the music from the decade of my birth and started the beat downs.  
  

## Warm-ups

The mission, disclaimer, and pledge were recited.  There were no FNGs.  We ran from the flag to the top right parking lot listening to Aretha sing "Respect" where we circled up.  Warm-ups consisted of Side Straddle Hop, Good Mornings, Imperial Walkers, Sir Fazzio Arm Circles, Merkins, and Plank Calf Stretch.  We ran to the Picnic Shelter listening to Ike and Tina sing Proud Mary.

## Thang One

The Pax paired up for a nice Dora to the music of the '60's. 100 Merkins, 200 Little Bitty Crunches, and 300 Prisoner Squats while your partner runs the pickle. Upon completion, we ran to the Basket Ball courts.

## Thang Two

Remaining in pairs, we ran suicides while your partner did People's Chair. Unfortunately, YHC missed that two Pax had not completed Thang One and as they came on the courts, he was chagrined. He promptly called Merkins on himself for the oversight. The Pax joined in heartily. Build Me Up Buttercup played merrily in the background. Then it was off to the front Parking Lot.

## Mary and COT

We circled up for a Pax-called Mary. 15 reps of whatever exercise the Pax called. Crunching, Cockroaches, Homer, Marge, Cut up Boxes, and others were experienced. We wrapped up with Have a Nice Day to which we were entitled since we started with a Good Morning.

Announcements were made. Prayers were requested. I wish I could remember specifics, but at my age, remembering as much as I have is impressive. As always, it is a privilege to lead this wonderful group of men.
