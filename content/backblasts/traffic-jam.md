YHC had intentions of bringing a whole BRR team to Rush Hour to show them Cary by daylight.  This was to coincide with a "scheduled" team meeting to occur later in the evening.  I talked a big game, told Banjo we'd have a HUGE turnout.  Turns out we couldn't _all_ be present, so it was cancelled.  Leaving me bringing...me.

Anywho-I arrived a few minutes early, to check how many ramps were in the parking deck.  Quick recon run to find out, encountering Banjo inbound in the action van.  5:20 arrived, and just a few minutes later, so did Asystole.  And we were off by 5:25 for a little extra credit.

    - Mosey on the flats
    - 60%-70%-80% on the ramps

Others unspoken (or missed by YHC)

YHC took us out

**NMS**

- I had good intentions of getting there earlier, and actually being able to lay a few things out, but alas, a traffic jam slowed my arrival.
- Asystole can fly up a parking deck ramp.
- So can Banjo.
- YHC can not.
- I wonder if TOC cares that there are roughly 40 pipe-b@mb looking things stored behind their deck?  Or if we spray the area with roundup?
- When will the snakes start hanging out back there?  I'll make sure to NOT be there the day we find out.
- Mucho chesto sure can wind a fella...
- We were asked if we were the TOC FD by the train station staff.
- WOW that train sure can stop fast!
- YHC should probably retire the Wilt Chamberlain gig.  I mean really, that last set of jump lunges is TOUGH after a bit.
- Intervals up Academy street looked good on paper.  (Modified Banjo fartlek)
- So glad we could grace Angry Elf's driveway with our "presence" (or is that "presents"?)
- Yes, that little park does have a name-we'll see it again next time I Q in downtown Cary (need to elbow my way into a BO Q)
- Got a little far from home, sorry fellas.
- Wise site Q suggested Ab work at just the right time, we got to show up that for-profit bootcamp!
- So.  Much.  Traffic.  just waiting to cross the street to get back to the flagpole
- Last again in the Billy Run.  Dang y'all are fast.
- Need to make a small signboard to put on the sidewalk that says: **http://f3nation.com/locations/cary-apex-nc/**
- HH ensued at BB.  Do not try the cherry sour.  Just don't.  Great 2nd F with Michelob, Foo, and Cracker Jack.  Wandering Moose food truck w/good grilled cheese, cuban, brisket sammich.
- BRR team was missed.  Hope we can get together soon.
