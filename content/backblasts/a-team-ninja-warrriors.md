Holy open gates Batman! Over the course of the last few months, YHC has gotten pretty used to the gates being closed, so therefore the workouts have all been planned around that being the case for the last several Q's at YHC's beloved Ateam. This was the first time plans were foiled due to OPEN gates!

YHC put the EC on neighbor Cliff (Blackout) who was Carpex's newest FNG. He was the ONLY FNG this fine morning, despite some PAX members taking joy in confusing your hapless Q. The discclaimer was given and off we went.

**Jog around the loop** 20 SSH IC 10 GM IC 20 Hillbillies IC 5 Pikes L/R IC 20 Butt Kickers 20 Hackey Sacks 20 King David TT Burpee Count Off - 24 (Niiiiice!)

**NMS** This was an introduction to the Obstacle course. YHC had only glanced at it before. At least we got to run through it once. Hopefully that was good enough to inspire some new workouts using our awesome equipment. We just have to figure out how to keep everyone spread out.
