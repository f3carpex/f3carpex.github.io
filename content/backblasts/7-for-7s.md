A select group of 7 showed up at Sovereign Grace Church early Monday morning at a site so new that it still doesn't have a tag on the F3 Carpex web site yet. The location close to home and the allure of a high tempo workout was enough to inspire YHC to take the lead in order to continue building momentum for this new AO. Here's what we did...
