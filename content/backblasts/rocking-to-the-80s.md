In the gloom, Girls Just Want to Have Fun!

## Warm-up

With the mission stated, the disclaimer declaimed, and the pledge solemnly uttered, the Pax launched to the upper parking lot to circle up. The tunes were rolling and so were we for 2.5 miles over the course of the workout. It began with

- Side Straddle Hops
- Good Mornings
- Sir Fazio Arm circles forward and back
- Overhead claps
- Seal Claps
- Merkins
- Calf Stretch

## Thang One

Warmed up, me moseyed to the kiosk for a set of 7's up and down the hill. At the kiosk, we did LBCs and at the top, we did Burpees. Then it was time for a little run to the rock pile by the dam.

## Thang Two

The Pax paired up for a combined 150 Rock Your Body's and a run up to the top of the stairs at the dam to experience the sun rising for a count of ten and then return to swap with your partner. The 10-count was a suggestion by Loom and proved to be very wise for YHC. I'm not sure the message was spread effectively because I was completely out of breath the whole time. When we were done, we ran to the top of the dam and across it to enjoy the beauty of God's creation and the colors of the sunrise. Our destination was the Bocci court at the Senior Center although the Pax became confused since the Q was leading from behind. Way behind. Like out of site behind. Nonetheless, the intrepid Pax finally found their Q on the Bocci court looking for the defibrillator. He was sure he would need it soon.

## Mary

Encircled once again, the Pax were lead in Homer to Marge and Merkins to round out the workout. With seconds to spare, we ran to the flag for COT.

## COT

39 men checked in for COT including the Pax from Vespers and Rucking. The Odyssey this fall on October 5th was mentioned. Crazy Train was mentioned. There is a Ruck version of Crazy Train that was also referenced.

Prayers were requested for a co-worker battling cancer. Hi-Liter was thankful for the support over the last year since the death of his father. He shared how much the power of F3 and the generosity of the men in it has been to his healing.

As always, it is a privilege to be allowed to lead you men. If you have not Qed yet, it is an experience in exhilaration and humility. I recommend it wholeheartedly. So much so that I am willing to co-Q with you to help you have the experience, too. DM me if you are interested.
