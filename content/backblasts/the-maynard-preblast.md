Leaving bond park sr center in time to make it back by 6:30. Right on High House, Left on Maynard, bottles of water in blue cooler at the Cary HS water tower, left on High House, left into Bond Park just in time for COT.Â  10.7 total miles.

Sounds simple. Yet completely stupid and utterly pointless!
