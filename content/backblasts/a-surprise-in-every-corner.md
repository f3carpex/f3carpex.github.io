YHC, Michelob and Largemouth for a 4 mile "Hope we don't get lost and it turns into a 9 mile" EC run.

It's been awhile since I stepped out of the corn stalk onto the Field Of Dreams, so it was nice to be back and see all the smiling faces...and Banjo. No FNGs so off we went. Quick run around the lower parking lots and circled up.

**Warm Up  
**Good Mornings, Windmill, Steve Earle, Arm Circles, Mountain Climber

**Thang 1**  
Into the soccer field and partner up: P1 begins to crab walk from one end line to the other. P2 completes 10 L/R Jump Lunges, 10 Hand Release Merkins & 10 Box Cutters, then runs to the far end before returning to their partner to switch places. P2 is now crab walking while P1 returns to the start to complete the 3 exercises, run to the far end, and then switch with partner. Continue until both partners return to the starting line. Recover.

Repeat except Craw Bear with 10 Jump Squats, 10 CDD, 10 IC Freddy Mercury

**Thang 2**  
Starting in one corner we complete 10 Diamond Merkins, then run to the far corner, complete the 10 Diamond Merkins and add 20 IC American Hammers. Run to corner #3 for 10 Diamond Merkins, 20 IC American Hammers, 30 Squats. Run to corner #4 for 10 Diamond Merkins, 20 IC American Hammers, 30 Squats and add 40 IC Fluttering Superman. Recover

Return in opposite direction performing the one exercise from each corner; 30 Squats, 20 IC American Hammer, 10 Diamond Merkins

Reverse course run back to the flag and circle up

YHC took us out with a quote from Patrick Henry

> **â€œAdversity toughens manhood, and the characteristic of the good or the great man is not that he has been exempt from the evils of life, but that he has surmounted them.**"
