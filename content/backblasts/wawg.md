Peek at Google maps + Skipping EC for Recon = An excellent plan for SWW.  
Term Paper didn't let me off thaaaaat easy though! Props for that EH into a .8 mile EC to catch the EC 6.

Here we go! No FNGs (but a few new faces for YHC). FOLLOW ME.

Quick lap around the parking lot and weave through the basketball court to the greenway entrance lot. Circle up for:  
10 Good Mornings  
15 Imperial Walkers  
20 Standard Merkins (OMD)

Follow me out of the park, taking a left. Pause at the corner... and take another left. Pause at the hidden deck entrance... and take a RIGHT, crossing the street together. Up the hill and pause between the buildings.

Gawk at that beautiful staircase.

PARTNER UP. Circle the building in opposite directions. When you meet your partner, pause for some exercises:  
Lap 1: 10 Partner Merkins  
Lap 2: 10 Partner BB Situps  
Lap 3: 5 Bropees

Continue to that glorious staircase. Everyone find a spot with a railing. Knock out three sets of Calf Raises in Cadence... and continue to the shiny new (or spooky old) two-level deck.

On the top level, a bit of interval work:  
50% end to end, performing decending squats (20-15-10-5) at the lights on the way back. Repeat with a 75% effort, then finish with an AYG to the lit end. Double 10-count. To the bottom level.

Partner suicides: Partner 1 planks while Partner 2 runs to the first pillar and back. P1 to the second pillar while P2 planks. Ad infinitum... or till the Q calls it for time.

Mosey back via the patented Jigglypuff Shortcut (with a pause for merkins), and mosey back to the flag.

THAT'S IT  
COR - 16  
NOR - 4 RESPECTS, 10 meh, 2 HATES

Announcements:  
Hot Dog part of KKC is postponed a year. Come for everything else.  
  
Prayer Requests:  
Strength for Liverpool today.

This was Snooze's third post, but first backblast appearance #forshameyall  
  
Last Q was exercise-heavy. Today might have been a compensatory effort.  
  
Smokey warded off a curious security guard during our building loops. Hoping for an EH out of that one.  
  
Good recon is good until it's bad... sorry for dragging y'all through the mud this AM. At least it was at the end?  
  
#WAWG - where are we going.  
  
That's a Yoda reference, but when it comes to guest appearances, no one can beat Build-a-Bear with his flyby for Coffee with Oofta.  
  
As shared at CwO, SWW is such a complete AO - 5k EC run, SO. MANY. SOLID. OPTIONS for the main event, and the most-enduring on-site coffeeteria. Great work, Joe Smith and Oofta.  
  
THAT WAS FUN Y'ALL!
