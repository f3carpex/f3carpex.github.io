This site passes the "Harris Teeter within 2 miles of the AO" test... which should arguably be another core principle #AObathroomsalwayslocked   
I have found that this is a critical attribute when doing the pre-scouting of the AO the morning of the Q. #recurringtheme #tmi  
  
Was not willing to bite on the Boy George attempt for Prodigal's name - Karma Chameleon would have had to be present for the workout. Went with the Orphan treatment on this one.  
  
Final Q of 2018 (unless the Maynard isn't terrible and no one picks up BH). I feel like a grew a lot this year through this process. It is no small feat to put together a plan and execute it - super t-claps to y'all who Q every month.  
  
Thank you, Swag, for sharing this morning. You being honest and vulnerable helps each of us to dig a little deeper in the hard things that happen in our lives.
