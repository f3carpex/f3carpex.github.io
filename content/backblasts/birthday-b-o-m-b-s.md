I"m always leery of the use of the aforementioned especially when on a public school campus in light of where we are as a society. In the case of today, the subject gave reason for concern for all within the immediate proximity but not need to worry about one's personal safety.

Warmup

The magic number of the day is 42 and we did so for Side Straddle Hop, Mountain Climber, Cotton Picker, Crunch Frog and Merkins.

Thang1 - AÂ  short mosey later found us behind Baucom Elementary School at the playground in the pitch black darkness. (Deploy four LED Camping Lantern Collapsible COB light IP54. Hurricane preps not all for not) Darkness vanquished.

Introducing the Burp-up. All parents are familiar with the word but F3 has a way of assigning physically painful meanings to everyday household words. Perform a Burpee but instead of jumping at the end jump up to a pull up bar and perform a pull-up.
