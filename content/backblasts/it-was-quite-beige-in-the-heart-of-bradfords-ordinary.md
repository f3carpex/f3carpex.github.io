19 pax show up, everyone in one of Becky's freshly pressed TT's, no FNGs, gloves not required. Straight vanilla., or beige?

7 Rubberbands follow Angry Elf for stretching. The remaining 12 BOs head to the bank to warmup with various stuff. In plank position, Burt is called on ........ ? And he calls calf stretches. Yeah we were all thinking the same thing, waiting for it to sink in. Really? Shaking away the cobwebs, gathering his wits, he then has us going into a progression of calf stretches, merkins, and ..... you got it..... PLANK JACKS. Attaboy!

YHC is still inspired by the upcoming BRR which is now a mere 8 weeks away. People are starting to catch on, a little shaking things up is in order. But in the spirit of BRR training \[with teammates Burt and Coney\] and holding one another accountable...... the building blocks of an idea came together, oh, consider it done.

Mosey to the parking deck lower level to finish out some stretches before starting the Ladder:  
All pax run to top of deck and back down, complete below exercise, run up 2x, exercise, 3x, exercise, 2x, exercise, and 1x.  
\-- Between sets of stair runs complete following exercises:  
\* 1-2, ACCOUNTABILITY, partner one completes five Burpee’s whilst partner two is in low plank hold. Flapjack and continue till 50 burpees complete. Mary waiting on the six.  
\* 2-3, on the small adjacent grassy field, crawl bear from the lower tree line to the top of the hill. Mary waiting on the six.  
\* 3-2, ACCOUNTABILITY, partner one completes 10 merkins whilst partner two is holding modified superman plank (pinch shoulders and push elbows to butt). Flapjack and continue till 100 merkins complete. Mary waiting on the six.  
\* 2-1, twenty monkey humpers. Mary waiting on the six.

3 x four-man Indian run back to the flag. A very short Mary followed with a quiet and respectful have a nice day.

5 respects, 4 hates, and 10 mehs

Prayers and praises: angry elf, his M, brother-in-law, and mother-in-law. Leprechaun at scout camp. Speed Racer’s M and her job selection. Gilligan. Disco Duck and his M. Pea Trap.

Thank you men for helping me start another peaceful day, El Bañjo
