By now, most of you know the story of the BreathTaker.  Once owned by South Wake's own Midget4Life, she has taken on a life of short term relationships with sweaty HIMs who pass her along after 5 workouts.  Once a robust 20 pound weighted vest, by recent measurements she only goes 16.6.  YHC acquired the BreathTaker from Skid Mark at DP on March 23rd.  A work trip to Boston messed up the normal cadence of posting schedule, and I quickly realize it will be possible to not only move BreathTaker out of region, but to go WAAAAAY out.

**Warm Up**

Family of 4 packs up the car for a 3 plus hour trip to Asheville.  The BreathTaker is coming along for the trip!  Remember to bring the workout stuff...stars/stripes for the Asheville F3 crowd.  Put said gear in it's own spot so that the funk doesn't spread to our real clothes.  YHC has been trolling F3 Asheville on twitter for the past few days, but so far no reply.  M thinks YHC is slightly nuts but this is nothing new.

**Thang 1**

Tuesday morning, April 2, arrive on the UNC-Asheville campus at approximately 5:20 am.  Cars start rolling in, time to make the grand entrance.  TTT, am I right?  Crowd is very welcoming and somewhat curious.  YHC tells the story of the BreathTaker, one PAX asks "when do you hand it off next?"  In about 45 minutes. Herb Tarlic has the Q, 10 PAX in attendance.

After warmups, we mosey to the steps of the basketball stadium.  22s, by 2s, Merkins at the bottom and LBCs at the top.  Loving this.  Guy by the name of Garfunkel is taking the steps about 5 at a time.  YHC accuses him of having helium in his shorts.  We then grab an ego rock for some curls, squats, rows, and overhead presses.  Followed by my favorite exercise of this workout, wall jump burpees.  Mosey back down to the track for some wall press up exercise that I don't think has a name, and then to the parking lot for Mary.  No time for Mary.

**Thang 2**

During announcements, YHC takes the opportunity to complete the tale of the BreathTaker, and officially hand her over.  Little Punk, our lone rucker, gladly volunteers.  Funny, I feel much lighter now.  She's in a good place, and YHC invites the PAX to join Carpex if they're ever in town.  I think a couple of them may take me up on it. Herb Tarlic takes us out with prayer.

**NMS**

Learned a couple things about the Asheville crew.  First of all, they don't clap on Cotton Pickers.  I was a little confused at first but fell right in with them.  Second, mumble chatter is optional here.  Not a lot in the beginning, but YHC got some good stuff going during the 22s with a couple PAX who played along.

I did call them out for not responding to my Twitter trolling.  Met their Comms guy (taking the picture), and he laughed and said he'd been out for a couple days.  I told them all about the F3 Breathtaker twitter and asked that they provide updates on her whereabouts.

This is a good group of HIMs, a growing F3 presence in Asheville.  If you're in the area, I encourage you to post with them.  It is also an excellent place for great food and beer, not that any of you care about that stuff.
