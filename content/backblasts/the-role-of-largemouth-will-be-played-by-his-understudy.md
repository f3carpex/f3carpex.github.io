With just under 12 hours on the clock before the start of Kryptonite, the call went out that Largemouth was dealing with a stomach bug. So I dusted off the script, prepped for the part and took the stage as the Q for a morning performance. And although the audience was visible upset, no one left the theatre and demanded their money back.

Praises for Old Main's 2.0 for hanging with some Raleigh Runners at Amsted and leave dear 'ol dad in the dust.

YHC took us out with a quote from The Wisdom Warrior

> I choose to live by choice, not by chance. To be motivated, not manipulated, to be useful, not used, to make change not excuses, to excel, not just compete. I choose self-esteem, not self pity, I choose to listen to my inner voice, not the random opinions of others. I choose to do things that you won't so I can continue to do things you can't.
