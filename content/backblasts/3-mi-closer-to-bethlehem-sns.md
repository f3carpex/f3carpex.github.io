Warm Up

23 PAX took off for SNS while 6 departed for Vesper. Mosey to the intersection for a selection of SSH, Imperial Walkers, slow/fast high knees to warm up the legs.

**Thang 1: Community Center Parking lot**

Count off into three groups for No-Man-Left-Behind Burpee 100.  Group 1 starts doing burpees at stop sign entering parking lot. Count burpees as a group, slowest count is the group count. Group 2 starts at the rock pile/wall doing Balls to the Wall.  Group 3 runs from rock pile to relieve Group 1 doing burpees, picking up the count where they left off.  Group 1 then runs to relieve Group 2 doing BTTW, Group 2 then runs to relieve Group 3 doing burpees…repeat until the total Burpee count is 100.  Each groups stays together.  Each group did right about 33 burpees and a 2 cycles of BTTW to failure.  Funny how that works out.

Indian Run in your 3 groups from Community Center Parking Lot to Sertoma Amphitheatre Parking lot

**Thang 2: (A shortened) Sertoma Amphitheatre Parking Lot**

Partner up for partner wheelbarrow relay to the end of the (unfortunately short) parking lot, run back.  Do relays in your 3 groups. PAX waiting do some Mary, including LBC and Squats.

Indian Run in your 3 groups from Sertoma Amphitheatre Parking lot to Bond Park Lake parking lot and large shelter

**Thang 3:  BP Lake Shelter and Parking lot**

In groups of 3 PAX, YHC called DORA 1-2-3 with 100 Derkins, 200 Alt LR Stepup, 300 LBC.  Leave one PAX behind, 2 PAX run around the small parking lot pickle.  Drop 1 PAX to continue Dora while other two.  This way you run 2 laps, exercise 1.  Most PAX made it through the 200 Stepups befrore YHC had to audible because of time. Some HIM were working on the LBCs.

Indian Run in 3 Groups back to the Comm Center parking lot via the trail (the short way).  Stop at Community center parking lot for AYG to the corner.  A couple 10 counts.  A second AYG back to the flag and I believe most of the PAX had enough, including YHC.

Mary consisted of 30 seconds of Have a Nice Day.

Prayers and Praises: Young man in Chinese Downhill’s son’s fraternity, Grease’s Mom, Fires in California

NMS:

- Covered 2.8 mi towards Bethlehem, pleasure to lead you men this morning, second Q for YHC.
- Incredible job picking up the 6 today and keeping all PAX together.  Great effort out there.
