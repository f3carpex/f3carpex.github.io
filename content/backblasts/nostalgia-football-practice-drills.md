**_Nostalgia – Football Practice Drills_**

On Saturday during coffeeteria after a brutal Hi-Liter led Phoenix beatdown, Build-A-Bear asks if I am going to FMJ.  I stated “yes” enthusiastically.  The follow-up question was, would you Q FMJ?  I gladly accepted.  I thought through what I wanted to do so I could make sure Build-A-Bear would get a good workout and I did not disappoint.  What’s funny is no Build-A-Bear to be seen at FMJ.  I was stood-up. It’s my fault for assuming.  You know the meaning behind the word “ass-u-me”.  LOL. I’m honored to serve as the Q for FMJ which was my first time Q’ing the AO.  So here we go.  As you can see from the title, we are bringing it back old school.

**Warm Up**

We moseyed to warm-up the legs a little.  We stopped at the corner for a quick warm-up. GMs, Cotton pickers, windmills, Sir Fazio arm circles forward, overhead claps, and SF arm circles backwards and finally merkins x25.

**The Thang**

After the quick warm-up, we moseyed over to the 50-yard line on the football field.  I let the pax in on what I concocted to bring it back to our football drill days.

Thang 1: In two columns, 2 Pax will do 5 rounds of merkins x10, 50-yard sprint, and then 5 squats.  No one starts until I say “go”.

Thang 2: Circle up for some high knees with burpees x10 on my down mixed in.

Thang 3: In 2 lines, we did 3 rounds of 25-yard bear crawls with a plank hold until group two catches up.  Q calling “go’ again.

Thang 4: Circle up for more merkins with 6-inch hold mixed in.

Thang 5: Back into two columns for 3 rounds of 25-yard lunge walk 2x2. Q calls “go” again.  Turn around and lunge walk back to starting point when Q calls “go”.

Thang 6: Circle up for some squats and squat hold.

After doing drills, we moseyed over to the playground for some modified jack webs (1 pull-up to 4 squats up to 5).  Some Pax did EC by doing 1 pull-up to 5 squats.

Once all Pax were complete, we moseyed over to the backside of the hill next to the flag for bear crawl up the hill and crawl-bear down the other side.  After that, we walked to the flag and circled up for some Mary.

**Mary:**

With 9 mins left, we circle up and Q calls on a pax for their favorite Mary exercise for 10 reps.

American Hammers (Frisco), Turkish get up (Cataracts), burpees (Shank) and then have a nice day

That was the most running I did in a while.  It is always a pleasure to be out with you gentlemen for some good-old nostalgic football drills.  What a blessed morning!  Until next time!
