While the weather certainly could have been better, I thoroughly enjoyed a tight group of very pleasant seniors --  if the grey hair present was any indication, there was plenty of wisdom to be shared! 

As 5:45 rolled in the rain continued to fall -- no FNGs, only revealed familiar faces.  The group was informed that this is F3 – modify as necessary!  Started with the Pledge & moseyed behind the bank for…. 

The Warm Up

Circle up for SSH, standard merkins, run around the bank, Sir Fazios, merkins, run around the bank, calf stretch with merkins, etc.

Thang 1

Mosey to the Town of Cary Palace for Aussie pull-ups with alternating bear crawls across the drive & dips down at the fountain.  20 Aussies, bear crawl, 18 Aussies, dips, etc.  Nice work gentlemen!

Head to the grassy area for some Mary – side plank star crunches

Thang 2

Move on to the upper pickle – classic 7’s:  Burpees on upper corner with diamond merkins on the lower corner – fun times! 

Mosey back to the other side of the tracks but stop along the way for merkins with one are on the curb – nice extra work for the upper pec. 

Billy run back to the flag & we are at closing time – perfect spot for Shawshank Have-a-nice Days…..
