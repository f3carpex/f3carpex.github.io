YHC took us out: Lets remember the less fortunate as we move into the Holiday season and the colder weather, be there for those in need.

WTF. WTH is a Bop-it: Wrist twist forearm exercise, twisting handle to raise and lower weight. Options include. (1) arms out straight, (2) elbows to sides (3) curl between turns (4) dead-lift between turns (5) squat between twists (6) grab the ends and twist.   All told, this is a 3.3 on the Vanilla index. You will be seeing these toys in varying locations around the PCA \[Peak Containment Area\]
