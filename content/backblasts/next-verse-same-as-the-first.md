A crisp morning greeted 5 PAX for an old fashioned beatdown, (did the cold weather scare some of the regulars??).  GTL came in hot, just in time, for us to take off and mosey around the parking lot and down to a different area to shake off some of the cold and for:

## Warm Up

Good mornings

Side Straddle Hops

Cotton Pickers

Hillbillies

## The Thang

Done with the warm-up, although warm is a subjective thing, we are positioned on a new hill for 11s, 10 starjumps at the bottom, 1 burpee back at the top.  Up and down until we finish at the top with 10 burpees.  Pick up the six for some EC and then mosey over to the small office area and up the stairs.

Q instructs the PAX to grab some rail for some different exercises, some high irkins, Australian pull ups, dips, and little, baby dirkins.  Mosey around the parking lot and back up the stairs for, as Yogi would put, next verse, same as the first.  2 more rounds of “rail” work with a mosey and then we are done here.

We mosey down to the parking lot and circle around the kettlebells YHC had put out before the workout, a little **Hell’s Bell’s** beatdown.  We do a round of Kettlebell swings, lawn mowers, overhead presses, tricep extensions, and nut-crackers, rotating between each bell and medicine ball for each exercise.  Then, for a break we mosey around the parking lot and then back to the bells.  Next Verse, same as the first for two more rounds with mosey between each.

Since we have the kettlebells out it is time for Mary.

## Mary

With the bells, we do American hammers, dying cockroach, Freddie mercs, and WW2.  We finish with one-hand on the bell merkins.

## COT
