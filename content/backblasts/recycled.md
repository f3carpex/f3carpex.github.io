11 PAX is a decent number for a subfreezing morning at the only AO in Carpex that has an 0515 start time. Welcome to YHC's annual Back in Black Q! 3 PAX for a 7 minute EC run.

## Warm Up

Pledge of Allegiance, mosey to the big Koka Booth parking lot. Circle up for SSHs, Sir Fazio arm circles, Overhead claps, Steve Earles, Runners stretch and calf stretch.

## The Thang

Run the outer loop of the parking lot, which is around 0.35 miles per lap. At the 2 opposing corners, start with 10 burpees, 10 CDDs, 10 Jump Squats, and 10 LBCs. At the next opposing corner, do 9 of each. Keep doing this, running the loop, until complete.

Early finishers do an extra lap picking up the 6.

Having a little time to kill, implement Thang 1.1. Line up across the parking lot, bear crawl 1 parking space, do a merkin, bear crawl back. Then 2 spaces and 2 Merkins, etc, up to 6. Do a cool down fellowship lap, then mosey back to the flag.

## Mary

Merkins, WWIIs, and American Hammers. Have a Nice Day.

## COT

Three Respects and a bunch of Mehs. Announcements were announced, prayer requests were taken, and YHC took us out.

## NMS

- PAX seemed surprised that some of this Q was recycled. Don't be surprised.
- It was sleevy, outside of Wahoo
- The Garmin Forerunner 645 requires an occasional clearing of files, otherwise it won't record your activity if the storage space becomes full. No worries, Ma Bell can add you on Strava.
- Workouts DO count if they're not recorded.
- Captain Kirk was not here, but he was discussed. Joe Smith has something in common with him - same taste in hats.
- NY Bagels has a system, don't question it or you won't be welcome back.
- MIAGD, and be just a little better than you were yesterday.
