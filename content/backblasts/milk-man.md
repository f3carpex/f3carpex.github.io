I'll give you one guess as to how we ended up with FNG Milk Man on Friday @ DZ.

I honestly don't remember what all we did. At all. I know I wanted to use the sand volleyball courts but there was a group up there already. So we didn't. Except for the Mary. I remember that. And the COT.

Had to be there though.

**COT:**

13 PAX

Announcements re: October festivities.

Prayers for healing for some of our sick PAX and their loved ones.

Welcome FNG Milk Man!
