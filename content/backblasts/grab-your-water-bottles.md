The news went out the day before that the Green Mile was going to be run intensive but PUT6 friendly. Ten other men accepted the challenge and both their intensity and friendliness was on full display.

Six for a 3 mile EC run (YHC, Michelob, Denali, Sub, Largemouth, Chanticleer)

Running shoes remained on, some shirts were changed, and water bottles were grabbed. Parking lot Mosey tour then circle up.

**Warm-Up  
**Good Morning, Windmill, Tappity Tip Taps, Imperial Walker, Steve Earle, King someone leg kicks (I don't know ask Denali)

Grab your water bottles and lets go. Mosey to the top of the parking lot entrance. Or is it an Exit? (I don't know, ask Hi-Liter.)

**Thang One  
**Partner up. 10x Partner Merkins. P1 runs to bottom of the hill and back while P2 does 10xIC SSH, Int. Climbers, Plank Jacks. Flip Flop. When both P1 & P2 are at the top they run together to the bottom and perform 10x Partner Jump Squats.

Back to the top and repeato 2 more times.

Grab your water bottle and Mosey to the other entrance (or Exit.)

**Thang Two  
**Catch Me If You Can with your partner. P1 runs down through the parking lot, out on to the street and back to where we started. P2 performs 5x L/R Jump Lunges. Flip Flop. Both P1 & P2 perform 10x IC LBCs at the start.

Repeato 2 more times.

Grab your water bottle and Mosey to the entrance of the neighborhood across the street to ask residents what they paid for their homes.

**Thang Three  
**Split up into 2 groups for an Indian Run through the neighborhood

Grab your water bottle and Mosey to the entrance to the other neighborhood across the street from the previous neighborhood.

**Thang Four  
**One really long suicide to the end of the road stopping at the side streets to perform increasing number of burpees.

Grab your water bottle and Mosey back to the flag.  
EC = 3 miles / ME = 8 miles / Total = 11 miles

**100s, Have A Nice Day

YHC took us out with a quote from Germany Kent

> "Once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack. Gratitude is one of the most powerful human emotions. Once expressed, it changes attitudes."
