With our boy @callahan on the DL, we needed to ensure #ec-insomnia soldiered on.  So, with a few quick keystrokes Tuesday night, YHC devised a new route I don't think we've taken before; all the hills of the south side of Castalia.  PAX of 9 for the run, 2 for the stationary effort, and off we go.  Bye Large, Shawn D. Clair, and Denali...the rest of us settled in for a nice low-mid 8s pace, regrouping as needed (8:24, 8:16, 8:35, 8:24 mile splits).  Nice social run.

YHC had already mentally committed to a challenging #ao-wed-vesper distance/pace, so knew some gas needed to be left in the tank.  YHC was joined by Hotspot, Hasslehoff, Sooner (who had already run the Insomnia 4 with YHC), and Michelob.  Another 6PAX (see what I did there) trotted off with Hermes.  Our squad covered right at 5.5 miles.  This is a new Vesper route YHC tested out pre-Phoenix last Saturday.  This morning was an adventure, complete with hills, mud, dangerous road crossings, and helping a little old lady get her stalled-out go-cart-of-a-car out of the middle of Davis Drive at 0615. Yep, we did that. Michelob was not pleased with our pace. Something about a taper for a little trail race he has coming up.

Great running this am fellas.
