YHC has of late been having a hard time with the Queen, eating tons of crappy foods, generally being out of training rhythm. Thought to consider, "Make sure you eat whole foods that are good for your entire body. This doesn't mean that you can't enjoy your food or make room for plenty of indulgences. But your conscious goal has to be to eat for long term health and what you do most of the time is what really counts."
