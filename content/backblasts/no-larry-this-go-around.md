Shut In was afraid of what happened last time YHC led the horses at A-Team. The Pax tried some new exercises and were better for it...were they a bit creative? Sure. Edgy? Perhaps. Did you get to know your fellow man a bit better? You bet your damned ass....(hmmm, interesting choice of words). Anyhow, Shut In didn't want any more of what could come but his worry was unwarranted. No sir, this day was not to feature Mary's brother that lives in Key West, Larry. Larry didn't come out this morning but work was done nonetheless. South Wake brought a group as well and a couple of FNG's were christened as well. A great start to the week!

Warm Up: Jog into park and down road. 15x good mornings, 15 merkens, 15 IW's.

Thang: get in groups of 3. P1 to top of the hill and starjumps amrap, P2 planks amrap time, P3 runs to top of hill and begins exercise. P1 runs down hill and 20 partderkens. This went on for time, 15 minutes with sumo squats and merkens switched in at top of hill.

Mosey to basketball court. P1 bearcrawls across the court and runs back, P2 balls to the wall and P3 peoples chair. Switch thru until each man has gone thru all exercises 2x. Mosey down to shelter. Line up for cackalacky choo choo. This was a crowd pleaser and always tough when you have 28 men.

Jog back to mid point on road for 15 irkens. Jog back to lot near entrance. P1 to 2nd planter and more star jumps, P2 karaoke across and P3 dying cockroach. all thru 2x. Circle up and boat/canoe, side obliques with Banjo.

COT and Prayers

NM: solid group this am and good to see our brothers from South Wake. The growth continues with 2 FNG's this am. YHC isn't sure if it was just him or what but this am seemed tough. Who knows...I was moist, I mean sweated a lot, so there is that.
