A beautiful autumn morning, perfect for an F3 workout. YHC rolls in to Annie Jones Park to find Quikstop walking up and down the stairs holding a rucksack over his head. Frisco was supposed to join him for an EC run, but we didn't see him. I wondered why the lot was so empty, and asked if Claymore starts at 05:30 or 05:45. Turns out it's the latter, and I'm not the first Q to make that mistake recently. Better than getting it wrong in the other direction.

**Warm-Up** Mosey over to the left side of the parking lot and circle up for imperial walkers, cherry pickers, Sir Fazios and good mornings. And since by my incorrect timing everyone except Quikstop was late, five burpees.

**The Thang** Mosey back to the flag and retrieve bricks from YHC's MIL's trunk, then head to the tennis courts. Modify as needed, but do not let your bricks touch the courts.

Line up on the sideline, with bricks held overhead, lunge walk to the other side, stopping after each court for ten brick-your-bodies (rock your body with bricks).

On the other side assume the people's chair position for the wonder bra with bricks (up, and out).

Walk back to the other side with alternating curls, stopping after each court for ten squat thrusts.

Back on the fence for another round of wonder bra.

Return the bricks to Granny's trunk and mosey up to the pickle.

Ten nipplers, ten Supermans, ten dying cock-a-roaches, take a lap. Then nine, then eight, down to one, then back up.

**COT** **Count-a-rama**:  11 **Name-a-rama**:  3 RESPECT, 8 meh, 0 HATE **Prayers / Praises**:  Prayers for Sosa's father going in for a biopsy today, Prayers for Half Back and his M as they await the arrival of their 2.0. **BOM**:  YHC took us out

**NMS** If you didn't like the bricks, blame Pet Sounds. I thought the squat thrusts would be easier than the brick-your-bodies. I was wrong.

Good to have Captain Kirk back in the gloom, he definitely added to the mumble chatter.

Lots of discussion about old tv shows. Marylin Munster vs Morticia Addams, Ellie May Clampett vs Jeannie, and of course the ladies from Gilligan's Island. The winner? Mrs. Howell.

It was that kind of morning. Thanks for letting me lead.
