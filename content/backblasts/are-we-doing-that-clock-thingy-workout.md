So this is the fourth time I've pulled out this workout, but It has yet to get a name that has stuck. Term Paper remembered it and yelled out the above quote as we did our warm up run, but I don't think Clock Thingy Workout is the one.

Today I Googled "Circle of Fitness" and two things happened. First, this random guy's image came up, and two, I saw something that read "Wheel of Fitness." Now this gave me the idea to build a wheel with names of exercises on it that we spin to determine what exercise we do. So expect that the next time this workout makes an appearance.

I arrived early to set up and there was a bunch of EC runners coming in at random times, even 30 seconds before we started. You know who you are.

Disclaimer given to FNG Beltway and off we go.

**Warm Up  
**Short run, circle up for some Good Mornings, Windmills, Arm Circles, SSH, Imperial Walkers, Mnt. Climber, Merkin

Run back to the basketball court for the aforementioned "Circle of Fitness"

**Thang One  
**With everyone standing in a circle I called out exercises to be completed for 1 minute OYO, except for those standing in front of the fun toys I brought. They did 1 minute of the following:

Agility Ladder – Quick Feet back and forth  
30lb sand bag w/ handles – Clean & Jerk  
Ab Roller  
25lb sand bag w/o handles – Squat, press and slam  
Heavy Bag - Flipping it over  
Box Jump  
Kettle Bell  
Battle Rope

The rest of the PAX did: LBC, Merkins, SSH, Imperial Walker, Scorpion, Plank Jack, Hillbillies, Mountain Climber, Squats, Lunges, Star Jumps, Wide Merkins, Diamond Merkins, Big Boy Sit-ups, CDD, Freddie Mercury.  After each exercise we rotated clock-wise.

After we completed 1 round, we stretched our legs with a short run and then completed 3 more exercises until we ran out of time.
