13 pax braved the weather on a rainy February morning for high tempo boot camp/rucking. Actually, it wasn't as bad as it sounds. The temperature was high 40's and the water in our socks felt quite refreshing. The workout began with a thoughtful discussion about Tic Tacs and shrinkage. Of course, any discussion about shrinkage elicited the obligatory George Constanza reference. By 6:15, we had approximately 3.25 miles on our GPS watches. Not a Gran Torino record, but not too shabby...

We had an FNG join our ranks today. Welcome to Corey Weidner, henceforth "Skipper." Hope to see you back soon!

Ended with a quote:

“I wish to preach, not the doctrine of ignoble ease, but the doctrine of the strenuous life, the life of toil and effort, of labor and strife; to preach that highest form of success which comes, not to the man who desires mere easy peace, but to the man who does not shrink from danger, from hardship, or from bitter toil, and who out of these wins the splendid ultimate triumph.”     --T. Roosevelt
