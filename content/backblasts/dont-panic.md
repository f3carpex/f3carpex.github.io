**AO:** Dante's Peak  
**Workout Date:** 07/02/21  
When scoping out my Q, I quickly recognized Apex Nature Park from my Piranha Park Q. Excited for another visit, I pulled up to the park entrance just before 0540 to find the parking lot gate closed and no cars in sight. Was I at the wrong park? I tried to pull up f3carpex.com on my phone, but it wasn't loading. In a decent panic, I drove back the way I came on Evans. When I reached Apex-Barbeque Rd, I saw Clockwork heading in with the shovel flag, ready to go. So _that's_ what _Athletic Fields_ means on the schedule.  
Since my rough sketch of a workout plan was now useless, set on the other side of the park, I chatted with Clockwork for some quick recon. Basketball court for warmups, soccer fields were open, bear crawls on the bridge were a thing. Let's go!

**Warm Up:**  
State the mission, check for FNGs (0), and give the disclaimer  
Pledge of Allegiance  
Mosey to basketball court for warm ups  
Side Straddle Hop x20 In Cadence (IC)  
Good Morning x5 IC  
Imperial Walker x20 IC  
Sir Fazio Arm Circles forward x10 IC, reverse x10 IC

**Main Event**  
**1)** Mosey to soccer field for **Rack Em Stack Em** around one half of the soccer field. From starting corner run to corner 1, do five **burpees** and head back to start. Then head to corner 1 for five more burpees, corner 2 for 10 **merkins**, back to corner 1 for 5 more burpees and head back to start. Repeato, adding in corner 3 for fifteen **squats**. Repeato the repeato, adding in corner 4 with 20 four-count **American Hammers**.  
**2)** Mosey to the bridge and across the bridge. **Bear crawl** back across the bridge. Squat hold for the six. (YHC was the six, so the PAX had decided on their own to do the squat hold)  
**3)** Mosey back to lot and partner up for **Half** **Dora**. Exercise choices were the same as at Back In Black the day before, but since no one was there but me, no worries. Four-count **Plank Jacks x50**, Four-count **Freddy Mercurys x100** , **Jump Squats x150**.  
**4)** Too much time left for Mary, so **Jack Webbs**

**Naked Moleskin:**  
The expected rain held out until the very end.  
T-claps to Clockwork for the quick AO rundown to get me started.  
I tweeted out Don't Panic and Bring a Towel the night before because of the expected heavy rain. It looks like I needed the advice myself. It's a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy reference for all you whippersnappers.  
Well done, men. Honored to lead.  
This was my seventieth #F3Q21 #2021Challenge Q (seventy-second overall). Next Q is Saturday (tomorrow) at South Wake Dads.
