YHC concluded with a quote from author "unknown"

> "Life is tough. When you stand up, you're gonna be shoved back down. When you're down, you're gonna be stepped on. You'll fall down, you'll stumble, you'll get pushed. Success has been and continues to be defined as getting up one more time than you've been knocked down.
> 
> Life is hard, incredibly hard. You fail more often than you win. Nobody's handing you anything. It's up to you to puff up your chest, stretch out your neck, and overcome all the difficulties.
> 
> You want more than you have now? Prove it!
> 
> You want to be the very best? Get out there and earn it!
> 
> At the end of the day, success is what we all want. So, Get out on top! Run faster! Work harder. Dream bigger! Live better."
