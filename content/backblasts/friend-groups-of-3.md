Glorious weather, 15 strong, renege on request for headlamps and we are off

Warm up mozy around the parking lot followed by SSH, GM, Hillbillies and Mountain Climbers

Full House arrives a Full 2 minutes late. Penalty burpee for each minute. Now we are 16

Run to stoplight at the corner of the lake and note your finishing spot. Groups of 3 based on pace become your Friend Group for the remainder of the workout.

Stop at each light pole heading to office park, each pax does 10 merkins while the others do LBCs.

Re-group at the office park to Re-explain since most groups were only having 1 pax do the merkins.

Now that all understand, repeato at parking lot light poles, this time with diamond merkins and flutter kicks

Mozy under parking deck for BTTW, peoples chair and wide grips

Mozy to stairs to the lake for more of the same with one partner doing stairs and merkins at the bottom

Indian Run to bridge on the lake loop for more of the same

Work our way back to shovel flag and we are out of time.

In trying not to waste too much time explaining the friend group rotation, I didn’t give careful enough instructions. It was quickly clear that only my group understood, and it may have only been Shut In who heard it the way I meant. No worries, we got it eventually

As many of you know, I have a hard time committing to anything that is more than a few days away, so it was great to see an open slot for BIB Q that wasn’t too far in the future.

Total cluster on the prayers, but I appreciated the support and laughter as I botched them all.

9 strong for coffeteria and we have proof.

Always an honor to lead.

Love you guys
