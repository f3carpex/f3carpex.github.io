While running with the Travelling Circus, Pivot was saying how he hadn't needed to Q-beg\* the entire summer because BRR had brought out the inner Yogi in each of us. YHC thought we can't let this momentum slip away; after all, there are numerous other races to be run†, not to mention _slightly_ less running intensives adventures such as our very own CSAUP, _The Odyssey_ coming up in a few short weeks! And so, YHC got in a car and crossed into new municipal territories in order to accelerate the collective lithesomeness of the Pax.

**`*` Q-beg**: Slang so fresh it's not in the lexicon, meaning when a site Q has to ask Pax to Q because no one's stepping up and signing up on the [Q sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MjgZwuKGFcbxxCzHF9_wtdMM7x78_410A8BrbedpyD8/edit#gid=0).

**`†` other races**: Vis-a-vis The Beige Bro's very own [2nd Annual Mike Fiorito Race For Second Place Backyard Ultra](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DJSjGyfVKm67ztWDKrMYldNyWoZ-S1Hw-L_3dKFLFF0/edit?usp=sharing) this October, [South Mountains 50k](https://www.tanawhaadventures.com/southmountainsmarathons) next January, the [Smokey Mountain Relay](https://smokymountainrelay.com/) next April. Plus, Peaches told us all about the slightly-more-elevation-than-ravenramble Tabletop 50k he killed no less than 48 hrs ago, and still posted this morning

## COT

Carpex culture week is October-long, with one week each dedicated to Q school, Site Q school, shield locks (`match.com` style ???), and VQs.

First time for several of the Pax at Measure Twice, including YHC...great location, good site sleuthing by Pivot...I hear trail runs are in the future. Between that, the scented towels, and mat-wipes, I hope Pivot is leading the Site Q training coming up.

Flip-Flop had to leave before the full moon vanished; something about a ritual, I think, idk.

Parker went into full HIM & EH mode on a passerby...regrettably can't remember his name, but be on the lookout for opportunities when they present themselves.

Wondering how to come up with a yoga routine? Ruthlessly reuse from the interwebs. Taken from [Sean Vigue Power Yoga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kx4MfjYxWMc). Flow names my own.

A glorious breeze kicked up at the end, encouraging us all to M.I.A.G.D.
