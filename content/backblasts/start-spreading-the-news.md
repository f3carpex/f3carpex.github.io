Sixteen go-getters decided that the prospect of a 60-minute Bartman Q was somehow more attractive than the spectre of 90 minutes of Banjo, and I don't blame them. So as not to disappoint, we gathered up, gave what was judged to be a minimally viable disclaimer, and headed to the community center parking lot, with some fortunate restraint shown by ToC's BFT-wielding CheddarBo.

We warmed up. SSH, GM, you know, the popular favorites. 15 of us did Imperial Walkers. Liverpool did... some kind of rockette shuffle? We had to do about 10 more than planned just to make sure we were seeing things correctly.

Merkins, MCs, and then Bartmarmorama. Who doesn't love a Moroccan Night Club? #rhetorical

Partner up. Catch-me-if-you-can on the way to the big shelter, 5 merkins when you get caught.

At the shelter, we were delighted to have our now-favorite ToC park staffer agree to join us for some true American Hero Style push-ups. "All the way down, all the way up," indeed. 20 of those left us with such a sense of accomplishment, we could've just stopped right there, hit coffeteria, and felt darn good about life. But we didn't. We were energized. Enthused. Inspired. So more exercise it was.

ALRSU x20, Irkin x10 IC (from the bench if you're feeling macho), Derkin x10 IC (from the tabletop if you're feeling macho). Repeato.

Find your partner again, and plain vanilla Dora it around the short pickle. #TWSS. 100x mericans, 200x LBC, 300x squat.

Gather the PAX and continue the catch-me-if-you-can, this time with 10x star jumps, to the kiosk via the boat house lot.

7's up the hill, burpees up top, hand-release mericans at the bottom. Plank-o-rama at the top when finished. Way to push it, fellas. By this time, the CheddarBo merican buzz was wearing off, and the humidity was setting in.

Still, more work to be done. Mosey back toward the start, with an old-school, in-the-flow Billy Run when it made sense.

Find your partner again, and the two of you occupy a parking space. The two of you attempt to push each other out of the space sumo-style. If you succeed, the loser does 5 mericans before continuing. It seemed many made the (correct) choice to also push five out as the winner rather than standing there looking like an even bigger idiot.

After a minute or two, recover. Credit to Drama Queen from Winston-Salem for this one. #dashstrong

Round the morning out with 40x American Hammers. Nice morning, fellas. Way to swallow down some concentrated industrial-strength vanilla.
