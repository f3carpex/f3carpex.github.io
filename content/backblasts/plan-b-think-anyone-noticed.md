YHC signed up to Q arguably the toughest of CARPEx AO's last week and immediately set to thinking about what to bring to the PAX. Pullups? Not at this sprawling hey pull-up-bar lacking site. Celebration Merkins? Ditto no... although the big shelter has plenty, there's just not that much room? Compass Merkins? There's a thought. But one of my fave's are the baseball fields, providing an nice setting for low-mileage beatdowns. YHC figured if the PAX wanted miles, Vesper & The Maynard were both available. If you're hanging with me, running may not be your thing.

Arriving a respectable quarter hour early, and leaving @flipflopcarpex in the car to finish putting himself together, YHC ran over to the fields to check on conditions. Plus, hey, it's a bit of EC right? Approaching Field One, all looked good. The lights were one, the path clear. Sadly, the large lock on the gate deflated my spirits. Checking the other 3 entrances to no avail, it's time to see what Field Two has to offer. Disappointment.

Fine... Plan B it is. YHC had just listened to a podcast extolling the virtues of high-intensity workouts and recalled "The 7-Minute Workout" I'd downloaded in my pre-F3 days. Back then I was way out of shape and those kicked my a$$. Let's see what 2+ years of F3 hath brought.

Warm-up

- 19x GM (you can't have a great day without a good morning)
- Lots of Sir Fazio's
- Jog over to the baseball fields

Thang

Bearcrawl over to the rockpiles by the creek and grab a shmedium rock. Surprise! Only Atlas Shrugged leftovers here. Prodigal grabbed two... the rest of the PAX struggled with one.

Series of cluster-ish 1-minute 5-set sessions ensued, 5-minutes at a time. Every 5-sets the PAX ran at high speed to the other baseball field and continued. YHC gave Gap Year an opportunity to give the PAX a rest with a 10-count. It's obvious he's been out of school too long. Luckily Saban looked at his watch and helped count along with the blicking numbers on his wrist.

- Rock Your Body
- Merkins
- Squats
- Dips
- Lunges
- Jump Squats
- some other stuff

YHC thought things were going pretty well, especially when the sound of the PAX huffing was interrupted by some tunes emanating from somewhere in the vicinity of Flacco. Sadly, it was not meant to last as 4 minutes later, Flacco is desperately trying to convince the Cary PD that no, he is not up to shenanigans in the darkest regions of Bond Park at 6:12 in the morning.

Coming up on 6:15, and with the PAX barely moving their boulders above their waist, it's time to head back. Indian Run back to the flag for a very short

Thanks for sticking with me men. It is always a pleasure working with you and doubly so when given the opportunity to lead and learn.
