Last minute change in Q due to schedule adjustments, so I had to think up a workout pretty quickly for this post. I've been wanting to take advantage of the Elevate obstacle course at Ragnarok and this was the perfect time to do so...but how to make it really hard without crushing the PAX's legs right before the Odyssey CSAUP?? Here's how we did it:
