The NC summer is officially here. How does one know? When you're driving to an AO at 4:43 AM and your wipers are going but it's not actually raining... it's humid. And hot. And it was both of those today.

_\[Editor's note: as I was working on this BB, YHC noted that Cauliflower posted an eerily similar BB at the same time. You can read his masterpiece here: [https://f3carpex.com/2020/06/10/summer-in-nc-almost/](https://f3carpex.com/2020/06/10/summer-in-nc-almost/)\]_

## EC:

Called an EC run. Luckily noone took me up on it since YHC requested a 4:50AM start but, due to bodily function delays, arrived closer to 4:56. That was a bit late to attempt the full 3.7 mile, HDD+ loop I had in mind so... it's cheat time! Drove to the HT parking lot and shaved ~1.2 miles. Sure, I had to go get it later but Hey! ... Mafia points!

Aside: DtP is a cool spot. Don't get me wrong... I love me a park AO. In fact, every time I post Metro or The Fort, I feel bad for those dudes. Chick-fil-A parking lots are just not the same thing as Danger Zone. But an urban setting every now and then ain't too bad.

## Warm-up:

Mosey - carefully, looking both ways across the street - to the parking lot behind Scratch. Circle Oval up for: 25x IC SSH, 15x IC IW, 10x IC Cherry Pickers, 7-ish IC Abe Vigoda

Find a curb for Dominoes. hold Plank, Left Arm Up while the PAX do 3x merkins starting with Sooey. Regular Plank after "Done". 5x IC Michael Phelps to recover. Flop-flip torpedo with the Right Arm Up.

Mosey down to Carey Jones Park & Swimming hole. YHC's kids swam here a few times and I remember the hill well.

## Thang

Split the PAX into 4 groups of 4 each. Each PAX takes turns doing one of 4 exercises. When the runner gets back, 5 burpees as a group before rotating through:

Round 1: run / bear crawl up & down the hill / AMRAP Merkins / AMRAP LBC

Round 2: run / BTTW / AMRAP CDDs / AMRAP H2M

Round 3: run / Peep's Chair / AMRAP Supermen / AMRAP Flutter Kicks

Got a little bit of time for a quick round of 7x compass merkins on that super steep incline.

Mosey back to the flag

## Mary

Not much time left after all. Place your kiester on the bricks for Beach Body by Pierogi: 25x IC LBC, 20x left-side obliques, 20x IC L/R Heel Touches, 20x right side obliques.

Finished perfectly on time if you like your beatdowns to last 47 minutes.

Shut-in was not amused.

## COT

Countarama: started with 16; ended with 16; somehow got slack-blasted with 18

Announcements: none really. Woke Zone?

Prayers: all our guys on IR

## NMS:

- GPS failed me on the HDD+ run. Didn't pick up until several minutes into the run while I was in the middle of HDD. Bummer.
- It was moist. Very very moist.
- Logged 1 Geocache near my car on the way back.
- Good to see the POGLers this morning. Solid group, great mumble. Especially Crimson who clearly wanted to wake the dead in the cemetery next door to the pool.
