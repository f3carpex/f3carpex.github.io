**AO:** Flirtin' With Disaster  
**Workout Date:** 06/01/21  
YHC was looking to mix things up with a set of Number of the Beast (lifted from Jimmer's Ambassador Q), but I couldn't find a good area with six clearly defined stations. I did check out the shopping center parking lot on my prerun, but ultimately I couldn't get over how well the Flirtin' With Disaster parking lot was set up for 7-11s.

**Warm Up:**  
Give the mission statement, check for FNGs (0), give the disclaimer, and warm up:  
  
Side Straddle Hop x20 In Cadence (IC)  
Good Morning x5 IC  
Imperial Walker x20 IC  
Sir Fazio Arm Circles forward x10 IC, reverse x10 IC  
Standard Merkins x10 On My Down (OMD)  
Mountain Climbers x10 IC  
Downward Dog with calf isolation stretches  
World’s Greatest Stretch

**Main Event**  
**1)** **7-11s** from the back lot to the front lot basketball court: a set of Elevens (WW1s and Burpees) with seven Little Baby Crunches every time we turned the main corner.

Prayers for Greenbow's sister-in-law's brother-in-law, who just passed from COVID-19. He leaves behind a wife and daughter. Other prayers unspoken.  
YHC took us out

**Naked Moleskin:**  
I always feel a little guilty calling 7-11s since they take up most, if not all, of the workout, but they are simple and effective. The dogleg parking lot was perfect for it.  
My generous GPS (Apple Watch) clocked in at 3.01 miles. Others were close. I didn't intend to lead a workout that almost qualifies as High Tempo (at least on distance), but here we are.  
T-claps to Disco Duck for applying smooth pressure to get others to step up and Q. The second bell is a wonderful thing.  
T-claps to Garbage Plate on his second post after being an FNG at the Carpex Murph at Hot For Teacher yesterday!  
Most, if not all, stayed for a least a little Coffeeteria.  
Trunk coffee always wins (maybe not in the dead of Winter). Great fellowship.  
This was my fifty-fourth #F3Q21 #2021Challenge Q (fifty-sixth overall). Next Q is Thursday at Green Flash.
