Who doesn't love to get pushed by their brothers? 16 HIM pushed and pulled each other along at GT.

Warm-up: Mosey to the greenway parking lot for some cadence-counted Good Mornings, Hillbillies, Calf stretches, Merkins, and Side Straddle Hops.

Thang 1: Burpee-intervals, with the winner of each interval earning the chance to rest and pick up the six. But mostly we saw Beaker's back. Then a group run to the figure-eight flagpole.

Thang 2: Figure 8 Dora 1-2-3 with Merkins, LBCs, and Squats; mosey back to the flag for some Mary.

Mary: Box cutter, superman, not-so-low-or-slow flutters, and have a nice day.

Wonderful COT.
