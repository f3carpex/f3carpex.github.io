On a delightfully warm, yet misty morning, 14 PAX rolled into the gloom hoping to check the Kryptonite box for what would be an easy Ma Bell workout (at least that's what Hermes said). 'Twas not to be. At 0530 - OK, 05:30:20 seconds. Come on fancy watch, catch a GPS signal already! - we rolled on. As per normal, #15 (I'll let you guess who that was) came in on 2 wheels as we ran (at a pretty good clip, mind you) around the parking lot onto the greenway toward the lake and back around to the parking lot for

**Warm-Up**

Wait, where's #15? He was right behind us. Wasn't he? Joe Smith ran back to find him. To this day, I don't know where he was. Anyway, the rest of us did this:

- 25 x SSH IC
- 20 x Merkins IC

Yep, that's it, time for the Thang(s)

**Thang 1**

Get into groups of 3 for a 3-man Indian run around the lake. YHC cozied up to Largemouth and Squatter. We jogged hauled ass the 1+ miles around the lake until we reached the patio just before where the TOC rudely erected a fence preventing a complete circumnavigation of the lake. It doesn't matter, we were stopping for the hill (see Thang 2) anyway. While the six rolled in, YHC was trying to get his heart rate under 200 while Largemouth was checking out his fingernails like he was bored.

**Thang 2**

Follow me around the side of the building to the bottom of the hill for some \[insert name here\]'s Ladder. 10 Donkey Kicks at the bottom (each time), while at the top do ascending by 2 numbers of burpees starting with 2 and finishing at the top with 10. On the last trip up the endless hill, backwards run. Finish at the top.

**Thang 3**

Mosey over to the corner of big-ass parking lot for some escalating 4 corners

**1st trip**: Captain Thors - 2 and 4 at the first corner; 6 and 8 at the 2nd; 10 and 12 at the 3rd; 14 and 16 at the start/finish **2nd trip**: Jack Webbs (2:1 ratio) - same count at each corner **3rd trip**: No time to stop for exercises so we just ran around the perimeter of the lot and back to the shovel flag for a just-in-time finish.

**COT**

**Count-a-rama**: 15 **Name-a-rama:** 5 RESPECTs, 10 mehs **Announcements**: K2C this Saturday prefaced by the Murph at 0630 at Pullen. We'll park at the top of the lot past the pool. Makes for a better place to change shirts between events **Prayers**: Grease Monkey's mom, who had just gone through her 10th chemo treatment; Burt's BIL John who is about to undergo chemo **BOM**: YHC took us out in prayer

**NMS**

- Have you guessed who #15 is yet?
- I got 3.21 miles on my fancy watch. Somehow Joe Smith got 3.8. But then again, he had to go find #15
- I set 4 personal records on that jog haul ass around the lake.
- Gotta set the tone early for the PAX to respect you. Or something like that.
- Burt commented more than once on the form fittedness of YHC's shirt. I think he was just hiding behind the mumble chatter so he could stare at m svelt form without raising suspicion.
- Maybe I shoulda gotten the Large
- I wish Kryptonite wasn't so dang far away from my house
- I also wish the TOC would remove the aforementioned fence. Sure could do some cool stuff inside the venue. Kryptonite could also use some pull-up bars and benches or something.
- With this Q, I officially completed the 2017 CarPEX Leadership Challenge. Does today's Q also count toward the 2018 challenge, @termpapercarpex ?
- It was a pleasure and honor leading you fine men today
- Ma Bell. Out.
