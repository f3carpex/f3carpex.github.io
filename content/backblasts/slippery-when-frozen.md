No frills but plenty of chills for 10 HIM at Slippery When Frozen on Friday morning. Until the ice thaws this alternative name for the AO seems appropriate. Sorry that I didn't get there early enough to plow the parking lots clear of snow and ice. We found some dry spots and made the most out of it.

Warm-up:

Moseyed from one parking lot to another to loosen up the cold muscles and circled up.

SSH x 18 IC; Hill Billy x 18 IC; Merkins x 18; Plank jacks x 18 IC; Mountain climber x 18 IC; Arm circles forward x 9, Arm circles backward x 9 IC. (It's 2018 now, hence 18 count for each exercise.)

Thang 1: Inch worm down and back in the parking lot

The PAX assembled into two lines and commenced plank position. Each line then did an inch worm, indian bear crawl the distance of the parking lot. Once completed, we stayed in plank position and each line did an inch worm, indian crawl bear back the distance of the parking lot.

Thang 2: Jack Webb with burpees and squats

The PAX moseyed over to the large picnic shelter ... no Camp Gladiator invaders on this morning ... only the frozen chosen F3 brothers. We circled up and did a Jack Webb with 1 burpee to 4 squat ratio. The PAX members took turns counting each set of burpees and squats. It was great to get everyone involved. Burpees went up to a set of 10 and squats to a set of 40.

Thang 3: Partner up!

Under the dim lights of the picnic shelter we paired up and each pair was responsible for 100 merkins, 200 dips, and 300 LBC's. One partner lunge walked the picnic shelter and back while the other worked on the exercises, then flap-jacked.

Closing:

Mosey back to the flag but we stopped half-way along the way to do balls to the wall for a 10 count by each PAX member. Then, back at the flag we circled and closed it out with box cutters x 18, low slow flutters x 18, and 18 WWII's.

COT: Announcements - Denali Q'ing at 1.5 hour Whiplash (sorry Denali for the late BB); BRR info meeting coming up; Guest Q's from South Wake coming to certain AO's next week

Prayer - Kyrie's first official day posting up with the Marines was Friday; safe travels for Cousin Eddie and other PAX members. YHC took us out.

NMS:

This felt like a Tortoises limited running workout, but YHC didn't want anyone to fall on the ice. It's Slippery When Frozen out there. Honored to lead such a committed group. Thank you, gentlemen.
