Serious storms overnight, but a gap in the rain from 530 to 7 made for a great morning to workout.

For my 6th anniversary, 6x6x6 (or the Beast) seemed appropriate, but I wanted to mix it up. We made 36 stops throughout Down Town Cary, and performed series' of 6 exercises at each (sometimes throwing in 2 exercises at the stops)

If you want to know what we did (sort of), see the image.

There was some audibling along the way, but we managed to log 2.5 miles give or take.

So grateful for finding F3 and in particular, being lucky enough to have it be the Carpex version. I have a lot of room for improvement in my life, and it is because of F3 that I realize that. I want to keep accelerating and all of you are my fuel. Thank you.

Thanks for the Cloud Surfer!

Finally, how about that upcoming Pimento Cheese celebration in DTC.
