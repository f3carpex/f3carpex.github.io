The day didn’t start just like any other day. The FartShat was oh so close, butt didn't rear its ugly head till the drive home from work, but that’s another story.  

With BRR around the corner, 94 days to go, the training has begun for many newbies and veterans alike. And feeling a little behind the curve following last years nipple run, it's time to get into hill shape.  

Warm Up jog around the parking lot and circle up for various warmup exercises including runners stretch.  

Recover on mosey to the Green at Scott’s Mill trellis for some very basic, vanilla instruction:10 pull ups at the trellis, suggested modifications were negative pull ups or 90° hold. Continue only when done.

NMS:

- Lots of grumbling, about the hill, about the pullups. Sub posted a public notice that there would be a good chance of pullups. Red Ryder didn’t listen.
- Nice to have Nacho Libre visiting from Raleigh.
- FNG was asked by his buddy, “what is your hiking nickname?” “Rooster” he says. Well you won’t be getting that name. Pax shout out “Chicken Little”.  FNG responds, “I don’t like it”. The rest is history.
- Hanson may be a fast runner, but with those soccer arms, pull ups are his Kryptonite.
- Etch-a-sketch tried to pull a Brisket and call side straddle hops during Mary, newbie.
- Getty was Gettin’ it.
- Short Circuit was not happy, not at all.
- Several for EC run; Chanticleer, Etch-a-sketch, Hanson, Largemouth, Sub and couple others.
- Red Ryder for EC pullups.
