Historians, F3 Founders, Hip Hop Band De La Soul and of course Schoolhouse Rock all agree that 3 is a magic number.

> Three is a magic number. Yes it is, it's a magic number. Somewhere in ancient mystic trinity, You get three as a magic number.
> 
> The past and the present and the future. Faith and Hope and Charity. The heart and the brain and the body, Give you three as a magic number
> 
> Every triangle has three corners, Every triangle has three sides. No more, no less, You don't have to guess, When it's three, you can see It's a magic number.

So who are we to argue. It's best just to embrace it, not matter how much pain it may bring.

TC to Snots, Water Wings and Parker for their EC 5K. They didn't run home though. Not sure if it was planned, or they were just to tired from the workout. In an effort to make myself feel good I'll choose the latter.

And thanks for Webex visiting us from South Wake and Chipper from all the way up North in Cary, NC.

**Warm Up**

Mosey on up to the basketball court for some SSH, Windmill, Imperial Walker, Good Morning

**Thang 1**

Mosey over to the pond with a Bear Crawl across Bear Crawl Bridge for Dante's Peak First EverTriathlon. We got into groups of 3. Partner 1 was swimming (Fluttering Superman) Partner 2 was riding their bike (Freddy Mercury) Partner 3 was running around the pond. PAX completed 3 rotations.

**Thang 2**

We moseyed on up to the amphitheater. Partner 1 held BTTW, Partner 2 did Alternating L/R Step Ups on lower wall, Partner 3 ran the steps then double backed down the trail to swap out with Partner 1 who then took Partner 2's spot, who then proceeded to run the stairs. PAX completed 3 rotations.

We then stayed in our groups of 3 and did a Catch Me If You Can Indian Run back to the basketball court. While Partners 1 & 2 ran, Partner 3 did 3 L/R Jump Lunges.

**Thang 3**

Welcome to the Bermuda Triangle. We Moseyed to the soccer field where YHC placed 3 cones out in the shape of a triangle before the workout began. The PAX did Merkins at each corner, increasing the reps by 1 as we Bear Crawled from corner to corner until we finished with 3 trips around the triangle and 9 Merkins.

Just enough time to finish with a set of 100's.

P.S. Did you notice the references to the number three?

P.P.S. Look at that, I finished on time. I'm 2 for 5. If I bring it in on-time next Q, that will be 3 for 6. I'll be batting 500 and those are Hall of Fame numbers.

Memorial Day Convergence 5/28 @ FOD

Prayers for Water Wings brother-in-law

Praises for the PAX completing this workout.

YHC concluded with a quote from Martin Luther King Jr.

> "Courage is an inner resolution to go forward despite obstacles. Cowardice is submissive surrender to circumstances. Courage breeds creativity; Cowardice represses fear and is mastered by it. Cowardice asks the question, is it safe? Expediency ask the question, is it politic? Vanity asks the question, is it popular?
> 
> But, conscience ask the question, is it right? And there comes a time when we must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but one must take it because it is right. The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy."
